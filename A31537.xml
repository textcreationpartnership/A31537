            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                        <salute>SIR,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>DEdications, like all Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are generally the ſame; and 'tis as difficult now for an Author to find a new Complement to his Patron, as to make a Knight-Errant court his Miſtriſs without more Rivals in his Words than in his Love. This Conſideration, Sir, has engag'd me to ſeek ſome Perſon whoſe peculiar and diſtinguiſhable Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
<pb facs="tcp:54446:3"/>
might afford me a Subject to ſay ſomething new. I found Honor and Generoſity in one Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman; Candor, Affability, and ſtrict Morality in another. Some were noted for their Wit; and others remarkable for their Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Judgment. But theſe and other eſteemable Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have ſeparately engag d the Addreſſes of moſt Authors alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. I was therefore oblig'd, as the neweſt Subject I cou'd find, to pitch on a Perſon who had all theſe Perfections together.</p>
                     <p>Here I had a great Obſtacle to my Undertaking: For, whereas other Authors can recommend their Dedications to the World by ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing Diſcoveries, making Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue ſhine where the Public cou'd never find it, my poor Epiſtle
<pb facs="tcp:54446:3"/>
muſt want all theſe Advantages. Your Merit is ſo univerſally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd, that ſhould I enlarge in its praiſe, I can ſay no more than is own'd by all thoſe who have the happineſs of knowing You. Men cannot ſay I flatter, leſt they accuſe themſelves of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulation; and I am ſecure from the Cenſure of World, ſince, tho it differs in moſt things, it always agrees in Your Commendation. You have frequently met <hi>Cervan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> in Your Travels, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd with him in ſome of thoſe foreign Languages of which you are Maſter. 'Tis upon the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of this Acquaintance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, Sir, that he humbly begs your Countenance at home. For You have not only Delicacy of Taſte to diſcover and reliſh his
<pb facs="tcp:54446:4"/>
moſt hidden Beauties, but a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Humanity to excuſe his Faults. Thoſe two noble Qualifications, as well as a thouſand others, were in Perfection intail'd on You by Your Noble Father. He already ſees You in poſſeſſion of that rich In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of Virtue, which flows down in a plentiful Stream, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out impoveriſhing the inexhauſtible Fountain; while, retir'd from the Hurry and Buſineſs of the World, he enjoys that Philoſophical Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs which is the pleaſing Reſult of his Noble Actions and ſteady Courſe of Life, bleſt in ſo juſt a Repreſentative of his great Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                     <p>This Piece, Sir, has had the Fortune to be very happily patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niz'd in other Languages; yet <hi>Don Quixote</hi> in his preſent Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb facs="tcp:54446:4"/>
is bound in Gratitude to own the greateſt Veneration to the Name of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobleman. If he finds as kind and generous Entertainment here as his Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor has met with, he need not repent his changing Climates; and, if his Faults are not unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable, he doubts not of a kind Reception. The Favors of the Generous <hi>Engliſh</hi> always outſtrip Merit, and 'tis the Character of the Nobility to be kind to Strangers. Thoſe Favors I have receiv'd from You, Sir, the World will judg of by their being Yours: To ſay that You have confer'd them, implies they have been Great. Your own Generoſity, not my Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments, muſt be the Eſtimate of Your Bounty; which <hi>Cervantes</hi> pleads for his Entertainment at
<pb facs="tcp:54446:5"/>
                        <hi>Long-Leat,</hi> that delicious Seat of Your Noble Family. Be pleas'd to let him amuſe You there ſome Moments, till You oblige the Town with Your Return, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend once more to honor me with that improving Converſe, which at Your leiſure has been the greateſt Happineſs of,</p>

                     <head>The TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.</head>
                     <p>EVery man has ſomething of <hi>Don Quixote</hi> in his Humor, ſome darling <hi>Dulcinea</hi> of his Thoughts, that ſets him very often upon mad Adventures. What <hi>Quixotes</hi> dos not every Age produce in Politics and Religion, who fancying themſelves to be in the right of ſomething, which all the World tells 'em is wrong, make very good ſport to the Public, and ſhew that they themſelves need the chiefeſt Amendment. We have our <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi>'s that adhere to ſuch Adventurers, and who like the Squires Aſs love to feed upon Thiſtles. <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogenes</hi> in his Tub was no leſs romantick than <hi>Don Quixote</hi> in his Cage; and our Modern Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers in their Abyſs of Knowledg ſeem as fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inchanted as the Knight in <hi>Monteſino</hi>'s Cave. The Philoſopher's Stone is like <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Earldom; and the Virtuoſo's Perpetual Motion has very much of the Windmill. What can be more romantic than the Schemes of ſome Projectors, who are ſtill erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Caſtles in the Air; or more extravagant than ſome Poets, Men who abuſe every Body, tho their Dependance be on every Body, who in their mad Attempts invoke their Muſes, as Knights-Errant do their Miſtreſſes, and charge their ill Succeſs on
<pb facs="tcp:54446:6"/>
the ill nature of the Times, or Malice of Fortune, as <hi>Don Quixote</hi> did his Miſtakes on the envy of Inchanters; while their Diſappointments are only chargeable on the jadiſh Tricks of their <hi>Pegaſus,</hi> who like the Knight's <hi>Rozinante</hi> is ſure to ſtumble in the Career. But among all the <hi>Quixotes</hi> of the Age I muſt not forget my ſelf in regard to this preſent undertaking. I have ingag'd to reſcue the Hero of <hi>Cervantes</hi> out of the hands of his former Tranſlators, and to ſet him at large to ſeek hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier Adventures in a more proper Dreſs: for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a few People, who either take things upon truſt, or can like nothing that's done in the Age in which they live, may ſay of the Old Verſion, 'tis granted by impartial Judges that the Language falls ſhort of the Purity of the Engliſh Tongue, even of that time, and that it owes the little Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it has to the laſt Tranſlation's being done ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenely and ridiculouſly. For the firſt Tranſlators generally kept ſo cloſe to the Author, that they were obſcure, and even as much <hi>Spaniſh</hi> as he in ten thouſand places; and in others, either thro haſte or want of skill, they ſeem not to have underſtood him: but the Original is ſo beautiful, that 'tis ſcarce in the Power of any one to miſs of pleaſing, tho, like them, he tranſlated word for word, and often as School-boys do their Exerciſes. I need ſay nothing of a new Edition of that old Tranſlation, which, I hear, is haſtily furbiſh'd up by Capt. <hi>Stevens;</hi> for the Judicious will eaſily conclude, that it is impoſſible to mend it by patching, tho it were attempted by a Man who had ſome Genius for Comedy, and was able to ſuit his Stile to all the various Characters in this incomparable Work, which in ſhort is in a manner a Dramatic Piece. As for the <hi>Don Quixote</hi> what was publiſh'd ſome years ago, 'tis rather a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſque
<pb facs="tcp:54446:6"/>
Imitation of the <hi>French</hi> Tranſlation than any thing elſe. Never did <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſuffer more by <hi>Drake,</hi> than our Knight of <hi>La Mancha</hi> by the Writer of that <hi>Engliſh-Spaniſh Quixote:</hi> He has transform'd him worſe than any of his own Magicians, and handled him ſo ill, that his Valor appears only paſſive; ſo that in his Book he may truly be call'd the Knight of the ill-favor'd Face. He has omitted a great number of entire Paragraphs, a whole Story, and ſeveral Papers of Verſes, chang'd the Senſe, ridicul'd the moſt ſerious and moving Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, remov'd all the ſcandalous places in <hi>London</hi> into the middle of <hi>Spain,</hi> and all the Language of <hi>Billingſgate</hi> into the Mouths of Spaniſh Ladies and Noblemen. He has confounded the Characters and the Countries, and added a World of Obſcenity and fribling Conceits. He ſeems indeed to have let his Fancy run away with his Judgment, and to be ſure will plead Deſign for his Miſtake, and tell you plainly that he thought himſelf a Man of greater Parts than <hi>Cervantes;</hi> and that his Piece is an Improvement, not a Tranſlation of <hi>Don Quixote.</hi> Now I have ſo mean an Opinion of my Talent this way, and ſo great a Veneration for the wonderful Genius of the Author, that I fancy it the greateſt Juſtice to my ſelf to be juſt to him. Not that 'tis to be expected that a Work of this Nature can always admit of a literal or cloſe Tranſlation; that wou'd be to make the Book unintelligible, and not Engliſh. In ſome places we have minded the Senſe more than the Words; ſome things having a Grace in one Language, that wou'd not be lik'd in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. That high ſounding pompous way of Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which becomes the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> cannot always look ſo well in our Tongue: yet I hope every thing will appear to have an Air of the Original. Tho
<pb facs="tcp:54446:7"/>
our <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſpeaks <hi>Engliſh,</hi> he is ſtill in his own Country, and preſerves his native Gravity and Port. When the Knight or the Hiſtorian diſcourſe of matters of Chivalry, you here will find their Expreſſion daſh'd with ſome antiquated or bombaſtic Words, as <hi>Cervantes</hi> has done, but no where elſe: his Stile being polite and modern wherever the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſpeaks, or Men and Women of Senſe are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd. So that it was neceſſary to do equal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> as well as to the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> to give a good Tranſlation of this Work. And I have found it exceedingly more difficult to do the firſt than the laſt, notwithſtanding the great Aſſiſtance I have receiv'd from the beſt Judges of both Languages. Here I ought to own how much I am oblig'd to thoſe worthy Gentlemen, ſome of whom have not only ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd me with their Advice, but generouſly contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted otherwiſe to inable me to perfect this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking. Among the firſt, with all grateful Reſpect, I make bold to mention the Honourable Colonel <hi>Codrington,</hi> Colonel <hi>Stanhoppe,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Sheer, William Aglionby</hi> Eſq; who oblig'd me with the Story of the Captive, tranſlated by him ſome years ago; <hi>Thomas Sergeant</hi> Eſq; who has favour'd me with that of the Goatherd; and ſome other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who are not only Maſters of the Spaniſh, but of the Delicacies of our Tongue. I have alſo Acknowledgments to pay to Mr. <hi>Wycherly,</hi> Mr. <hi>Congreve,</hi> Dr. <hi>Garth,</hi> Dr. <hi>Pellet, Thomas Cheek</hi> Eſq; Mr. <hi>Savage,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Brown,</hi> and ſome other ingenious Friends, not forgetting <hi>Don Bernar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dino Navarro,</hi> at once a juſt Critic in his own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and ſo good a Maſter of ours, as to have made an excellent Grammar, which will be printed in ſome time.

<pb facs="tcp:54446:7"/>
to ſtrengthen my Party againſt the Cenſorious. I muſt own that I have made my advantage of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes and Beauties of the former Tranſlators; and by imitating what was good, and avoiding their Errors, may poſſibly have made this a tolerable Tranſlation. Where I have fallen in with their Expreſſion, 'tis ſometimes by accident, but oftner by deſign. I have had the good fortune to be a little converſant with the Stage, of which advantage my Predeceſſors in this Affair were deſtitute, as may appear by their lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Genius of Comedy which runs through the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and which I have endeavour'd to maintain by avoiding all Improprieties of Speech.</p>
                     <p>Here I cannot forbear admiring his ſtrange Art of moralizing with ſo facetious an Air. He has choſen to make his Book an exact Mirror of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, where every man may view his Face without any abuſe, but the ſilent Reflection of the Shadow, as it naturally flows from the Subſtance. This dumb ſort of Inſtruction he was ſenſible muſt be very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent with the World; ſince every body is fond of ſeeing their own face, be it never ſo ugly. In ſhort, his Book is in a manner a Dramatic Piece, with great variety of Characters juſtly maintain'd by the niceſt Rules of Art, his Stile generally follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nature of the Subject; and his Example is as juſt a Rule for the Stage as his Precepts. What can be more full and comprehenſive than the Humours of <hi>Sancho?</hi> Any man with half the Squire's Wit may read in this ſingle Character the mean, ſlaviſh, and ungenerous Spirit of the Vulgar in all Countries and Ages: a crouching E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb facs="tcp:54446:8"/>
ſignify the Rabble; but he makes Nature ſpin the Web out of her own Bowels, and ſhows us the Monſter without frighting us with the <hi>Hydra.</hi> The Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>Don Quixote</hi> muſt ſpeak its own praiſe: 'tis an Original without a Precedent, and will be a Pattern without a Copy; its greateſt fault was its too great Beauty, by which ſome think it anſwer'd the Deſign too effectually: Many men being ſtill of opinion that the wonderful Declenſion of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Bravery and Greatneſs in this laſt Century may be attributed very much to his carrying the Jeſt too far, by not only ridiculing their Romantic Love and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantry, but by laughing them alſo out of their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Courage: But that this was far from the Author's Deſign, is very evident from his many noble Sentiments of Love and Honour through his Book. The Ladies are infinitly oblig'd to him, the Characters of the Fair Sex are generally virtuous. He gives their Love all the moving Softneſs that can raiſe our Paſſions, without offence to their Modeſty. He makes them love like Women, but ſpeak like An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: And we may gather from his favourable o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the fair Sex, as much as by his Courtly Stile, that he kept the beſt and nobleſt Company.</p>
                     <p>The Conſideration of ſo many Graces in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal were enough to make any Tranſlator ſuſpect his Ability for undertaking ſo great a Work; but on the other hand, ſo many Beauties are ſufficient to entice any man to an imitation. <hi>Magnis tamen excidit auſis,</hi> was a noble excuſe; and the Attempt in a great Deſign is ſometimes as laudable as ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in a trifle.</p>
                     <p>I ſhou'd make a Complement to thoſe Honorable Gentlemen, whoſe Liberality has prov'd ſo ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial an Incouragement to me in this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking: but I muſt change my note to an Apology, for the
<pb facs="tcp:54446:8"/>
ſmallneſs of the Edition, and the beſt I can make is humbly to beg their Pardon. I deſign'd it a handſom Folio with a fair Letter; but there was a neceſſity of publiſhing this firſt Part of the Work im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, being inform'd that while it was ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing with all leiſurely Care, the Bookſellers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the old Tranſlation had got it alter'd with all ſpeed, and reſolv'd at any Rate to have it come out firſt. I hope my generous Patrons will forgive a Delay which was the effect of my good Fortune; I mean the Employment, for which with all Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I am proud to own my ſelf oblig'd to the great Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi>'s Recommendation, and the Favor of thoſe noble Patriots Sir <hi>Robert Cotton,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Frankland.</hi> This made the Bookſeller think of caſting this into four little portable Duode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimos; and indeed there is this Reaſon for't, that the Book being more for Diverſion than Study, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more proper for the Pocket than the Cloſet.</p>
                     <p>I have nothing more to add but the Names of thoſe noble Encouragers of this Tranſlation, which I preſume to inſert in the Order they ſubſcrib'd, for my particular Benefit.

                     <head>THE Author's PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
                     <p>YOU may depend on my bare Word, Reader, without any farther ſecurity, that I cou'd wiſh, this Offspring of my Brain were as ingenious, ſprightly, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd as your ſelf cou'd deſire; but the miſchief on't is, Nature will have its courſe: Every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction muſt reſemble its Author, and my barren and unpoliſh'd Underſtanding can produce no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is very dull, very impertinent, and extravagant beyond imagination. You may ſuppoſe it the Child of Diſturbance ingendred in ſome diſmal Priſon, in the very ſeat of Wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and amidſt all manner of Inconveniences. Reſt and Eaſe, a convenient Place, pleaſant Fields and Groves, murmuring Springs, and a ſweet Repoſe of Mind, are helps that raiſe the Fancy, and impregnat even the moſt barren Muſes with
<pb facs="tcp:54446:9"/>
Conceptions that fill the World with Admiration and Delight. Some Parents are ſo blinded by a Fatherl Fondneſs, that they miſtake the very Imperfections of their Children for ſo many Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and the Folly and Impertinence of the brave Boy muſt paſs upon their Friends and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance for Wit and Senſe. But I, who am only a Step-Father, diſavow the Authority of this modern and prevalent Cuſtom; nor will I ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly beſeech you, with Tears in my Eyes, which is many a poor Author's Caſe, dear Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to pardon or diſſemble my Child's Faults: For, what Favour can I expect from you, who are neither his Friend nor Relation? You have a Soul of your own, and the privilege of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, whoever you be, as well as the proudeſt He that ſtruts in a gaudy Outſide: You are a King by your own Fire-ſide, as much as any Monarch in his Throne. You have Liberty and Property, which ſet you above Favor or Affection, and may therefore freely like or diſlike this Hiſtory ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your humor.</p>
                     <p>I had a great mind to have expos'd it as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked as it was born, without the addition of a Preface, or the numberleſs Trumpery of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatory Sonnets, Epigrams, and other Poems that uſually uſher in the Conceptions of Authors: For I dare boldly ſay, that tho I beſtow'd ſome time in writing the Book, yet it coſt me not half ſo much labour as this very Preface. I very often took up my Pen, and as often laid it down, and cou'd not for my life think of any thing to the purpoſe. Sitting once in a very ſtudious Poſture, with my Paper before me, my Pen in my Ear, my Elbow on the Table, and my Cheek on my
<pb facs="tcp:54446:10"/>
Hand, conſidering how I ſhould begin, a certain Friend of mine, an ingenious Gentleman, and of a merry Diſpoſition, came in and ſurpriz'd me. He ask'd me what I was ſo very intent and thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful upon? I was ſo free with him as not to mince the matter, but told him plainly that I had been puzling my Brain for a Preface to <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> and that I had made my ſelf ſo uneaſy about it, that I was now reſolv'd to trouble my head no further either with Preface or Book, but rather not to let the Atchievements of that noble Knight be publiſh'd. For, continu'd I, why ſhould I expoſe my ſelf to the Laſh of the old Legiſlator, the Vulgar? They will ſay that I have ſpent my youthful Days very finely, to have nothing to recommend my Gray Hairs to the World but a dry inſipid Legend, not worth a ruſh, wanting good Language as well as Invention, barren of Conceits or pointed Wit, and without either Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations on the Margin, or Annotations at the end, which other Books, tho never ſo fabulous and profane, have to ſet 'em off. Other Authors can paſs upon the Public by ſtuffing their Books from <hi>Ariſtotle, Plato,</hi> and the whole Company of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Philoſophers, thus amuſing their Readers into a great opinion of their prodigious Reading. <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> are ſlur'd on the Publick for as Orthodox Doctors as St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> or any of the Fathers. And then the Method of theſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns is ſo wounderfully agreeable, and full of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, that they cannot fail to pleaſe. In one Line they will deſcribe you a whining amorous Coxcomb; and the next ſhall be ſome dry Scrap of a Homily, with ſuch ingenious Turns as cannot chuſe but raviſh the Reader. Now I

want all theſe Embeliſhments and Graces; I have neither marginal Notes, nor critical Remarks: I do not ſo much as know what Authors I follow, and conſequently can have no formal Index, as 'tis the faſhion now, methodically ſtrung on the Letters of the Alphabet, beginning with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and ending with <hi>Xenophon,</hi> or <hi>Zo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I ſhall want alſo the pompous Preliminaries of commendatory Verſes ſent to me by the Right Honourable my Lord ſuch a one, by the Honourable the Lady ſuch a one, or the moſt ingenious Mr. ſuch a one: tho I know that I might have them at an eaſy rate from two or three Brothers of the Quill of my acquaintance, and better, I'm ſure, than the beſt Quality in <hi>Spain</hi> can compoſe.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, my Friend, ſaid I, the great <hi>Don Quixote</hi> may ly buried in the muſty Records of <hi>La Mancha,</hi> till Providence has order'd ſome better hand to fit him out as he ought to be; for I muſt own my ſelf altogether uncapable of the Task; beſides, I am naturally lazy, and love my eaſe too well to take the pains of turning over Authors for thoſe things which I can expreſs as well without it. And theſe are the Conſiderations that made me ſo thoughtful when you came in. The Gentleman, after a long and loud Fit of laughing, rubbing his Forehead; O' my Conſcience, Friend, ſaid he, your Diſcourſe has freed me from a Miſtake that has a great while impos'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me: I always took you for a Man of ſenſe, but now I am ſufficiently convinc'd to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. What! puzzled at ſo inconſiderable a
<pb facs="tcp:54446:11"/>
Trifle! A buſineſs of ſo little difficulty confound a man of ſuch deep ſenſe and ſearching thought, as once you ſeem'd to be!</p>
                     <p>I'm ſorry, Sir, that your lazy Humour and poor Underſtanding ſhou'd need the Advice I am about to give you, which will preſently ſolve all your Objections and Fears concerning the publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Renown'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> the Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and Mirrour of all Knight-Errantry. Pray Sir, ſaid I, be pleas'd to inſtruct me in whatever you think may remove my Fears, or ſolve my Doubts. The firſt thing you object, reply'd he, is your want of Commendatory Copies from Perſons of Figure and Quality: There is nothing ſooner help'd. 'Tis but taking a little pains in writing them your ſelf, and clapping whoſe Name you pleaſe to them: You may father 'em on <hi>Preſter John</hi> of the <hi>Indies,</hi> or on the Emperour of <hi>Trepiſond,</hi> whom I know to be moſt celebrated Poets. But ſuppoſe they were not, and that ſome preſuming Pedantick Criticks might ſnarl, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this notorious Truth; Why, let them, 'tis no matter: and tho they ſhou'd convict you of Forgery, you are in no danger of loſing the Hand with which you wrote them.</p>
                     <p>As to marginal Notes and Quotations from Authors for your Hiſtory, 'tis but dropping here and there ſome ſcatter'd Latin Sentences that you have already by rote, or may have with little or no Pains. For example; in treating of Liberty and Slavery, clap me in, <hi>Non bene pro toto libertas venditur auro.</hi> And at the ſame time make <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race,</hi> or ſome other Author vouch it in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.

As to Annotations or Remarks at the end of your Book, you may ſafely take this Courſe. If you have occaſion for a Giant in your Piece, be ſure you bring in <hi>Goliah,</hi> and upon this very <hi>Goliah</hi> (who will not coſt you one Farthing) you may ſpin out a ſwinging Annotation.

The River <hi>Tagus,</hi> ſay you, was ſo call'd from a certain King of <hi>Spain:</hi> It takes its Riſe from ſuch a Place, and buries its Waters in the Ocean, killing firſt the Walls of the famous City of <hi>Lisbon;</hi> and ſome are of opinion that the Sands of this River are Gold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If you have

But if you wou'd keep nearer home, 'tis but examining <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeca</hi> of Divine Love, which you have here in your Study; and you need go no farther for all that can be ſaid on that copious Subject.

And for the Citation of ſo many Authors, 'tis the eaſieſt thing in nature.

                           <p>AT a certain Village in <hi>La Mancha,</hi> which I ſhall not name, there liv'd not long ago one of thoſe old-faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd Gentlemen, who are never with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Lance upon a Rack, an old Target, a lean
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54446:14"/>
Horſe and a Grey-hound. His Diet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted more of Beef than Mutton, and with Minc'd Meat on moſt Nights, Lentils on <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days,</hi> Scraps and Penance on <hi>Saturdays,</hi> and a Pidgeon extraordinary on <hi>Sundays,</hi> he conſum'd three quarters of his Revenue. The reſt was laid out in a Pluſh Coat, Velvet Breeches, with Slippers of the ſame for Holidays; and a Suit of the very beſt home ſpun Cloath, which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd on himſelf for Working-days. His whole Family was a Houſe-keeper ſomething turn'd of forty, a Niece not twenty, and a Man that ſerv'd him in the Houſe and in the Field, and cou'd ſaddle a Horſe, and handle the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-hook. The Maſter himſelf was nigh fifty years of age, of a hale and ſtrong Complexion, lean-body'd and thin-fac'd, an early Riſer, and a Lover of Hunting. Some ſay his Surname was <hi>Quixada</hi> or <hi>Queſada</hi> (for Authors differ in this particular) however, we may reaſonably conjecture he was call d <hi>Quixada;</hi> tho this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us but little, provided we keep ſtrictly to truth in every point of this hiſtory.</p>
                           <p>You muſt know then, that when our Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman had nothing to do (which was almoſt all the year round) he paſs'd his time in reading Books of Knight-Errantry; which he did with that application and delight, that at laſt he in a manner wholly left off his Country Sports, and even the care of his Eſtate. Nay, he grew ſo ſtrangely beſotted with thoſe amuſements, that he ſold many Acres of arable Land to purchaſe Books of that kind, by which means he collected as many of 'em as were to be had. But among them all, none pleas'd him like the Works of the famous <hi>Feliciano de Silva.</hi> For,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54446:14"/>
the clearneſs of his Proſe, and thoſe intricate expreſſions, with which 'tis interlac'd, ſeem'd to him ſo many Pearls of Eloquence; eſpecially when he came to read the Challenges and the amorous Addreſſes, many of them in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſtile. <q>The Reaſon of your unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable uſage of my Reaſon, does ſo enfeeble my Reaſon, that I have Reaſon to expoſtulate with your Beauty. And this: 'The Sublime Heavens, which with your Divinity, divinely fortifie you with the Stars, and fix you the Deſerver of the Deſert that is deſerv'd by your Grandeur.</q> Theſe and ſuch like Expreſſions ſtrangely puzzled the poor Gentlemans under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, while he was breaking his Brain to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravel their meaning, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf cou'd never have found, tho he ſhou'd have been rais'd from the dead for that very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                           <p>He did not ſo well like thoſe dreadful wounds which <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> gave and receiv'd; for he conſider'd that all the Art of Surgery cou'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſecure his Face and Body from being ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disfigur'd with Scars. However, he highly commended that Author for concluding his Book with a Promiſe of giving the remaining part of the unfiniſh'd Adventure; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times he had a deſire to put Pen to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and faithfully finiſh it himſelf; which he had certainly done, and doubtleſs with good ſucceſs, had not his thoughts been wholly engroſs'd in much more important De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="4" facs="tcp:54446:15"/>He would often diſpute with the<note n="*" place="bottom">In <hi>Spain</hi> the Curate is the head Prieſt in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and he that has the cure of Souls. Thus <hi>el Cura</hi> means the <hi>Rector,</hi> or, as the vulgar has it, the <hi>Parſon;</hi> but the firſt not being commonly us'd, and the laſt ſeeming too groſs, I chuſe to make it <hi>Curate,</hi> thoſe who have read the former Tranſlations being us'd to the word.</note> Curate of the Pariſh, a man of Learning, who had taken his Degrees at <hi>Ciguenca,</hi> who was the better Knight, <hi>Palmerin ef England,</hi> or <hi>Amadis de Gaule.</hi> But Maſter <hi>Nicholas,</hi> the<note n="†" place="bottom">The Barber in Country Towns in <hi>Spain</hi> is alſo the Surgeon.</note> Barber of the ſame Town, wou'd ſay, that none of 'em cou'd compare with the <hi>Knight of the Sun;</hi> and that if any one came near him, 'twas certainly Don <hi>Galaor,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Amadis de Gaule;</hi> for he was a man that would diſpence with any Thing; neither was he ſo finical, nor ſuch a puling whining Lover as his Brother, and as for Courage he was not a jot behind him.</p>
                           <p>In fine, he gave himſelf up ſo wholly to the reading of Romances, that a nights he wou'd pore on till 'twas Day, and a Days he wou'd read on till 'twas Night: and thus by ſleeping little, and reading much, the moiſture of his Brain was exhauſted to that degree, that at laſt he loſt the uſe of his Reaſon. A world of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly notions, pick'd out of his Books, crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into his imagination; and now his head was full of nothing but Enchantments, Quarrels, Battels, Challenges, Wounds, Complaints, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, Torments, and abundance of Stuff and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54446:15"/>
Impoſſibilities. Inſomuch that all the Fables and fantaſtical Tales which he read, ſeem'd to him now as true as the moſt authentick Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. He wou'd ſay, that the <hi>Cid Ruydiaz</hi> was a very brave Knight, but not worthy to ſtand in competition with the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword,</hi> who with a ſingle back-ſtroke had cut aſunder two fierce and mighty Giants. He lik'd yet better <hi>Bernardo del Carpio,</hi> who at <hi>Roncevalles</hi> depriv'd of Life the Enchanted <hi>Orlando,</hi> having lifted him from the ground, and choak'd him in the air, as <hi>Hercules</hi> did <hi>Antaeus</hi> the Son of the Earth.</p>
                           <p>As for the Giant <hi>Morgante,</hi> he always ſpoke very civil things of him; for tho he was one of that monſtrous brood who ever were intolerably proud and brutiſh, he ſtill behav'd himſelf like a civil and well-bred perſon.</p>
                           <p>But of all men in the world he admir'd <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo of Montalban,</hi> and particularly his ſallying out of his Caſtle to rob all he met; and then again when he carry'd away the Idol of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> which was all maſſy Gold, as the Hiſtory ſays. But he ſo hated that Traytor <hi>Galalon,</hi> that for the Pleaſure of kicking him handſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he wou'd have given up his Houſe-keeper, nay, and his Niece into the bargain.</p>
                           <p>Having thus loſt his underſtanding, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily ſtumbled upon the oddeſt Fancy that ever entred into a Mad-man's Brain. For now he thought it convenient and neceſſary, for the Increaſe of his Honour, and the Service of the Public, to turn Knight-Errant, and roam thro the whole World, arm'd cap-a-pee, and mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on his Steed, in queſt of adventures: that thus imitating thoſe Knights-Errant, of whom he had read, and following their courſe of life
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54446:16"/>
redreſſing all manner of Grievances, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf to Danger on all occaſions, at laſt after a happy concluſion of his Enterprizes, he might purchaſe everlaſting Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown. Tranſported with thoſe agreeable Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, the poor Gentleman already graſped in imagination the Imperial Scepter of <hi>Trebiſond,</hi> and hurried away by his mighty Expectations, he prepares with all expedition to take the Field.</p>
                           <p>The firſt thing he did was to ſcowr a ſuit of Armour, that had belong'd to his Great Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, and had lain time out of mind careleſsly ruſting in a corner. But when he had clean'd and repair'd it as well as he cou'd, he perceiv'd there was a material piece wanting; for inſtead of a compleat Helmet, there was only a ſingle Head-piece. However, his Induſtry ſupplied that defect; for with ſome Paſteboard he made a kind of a half Beaver or Vizor, which being fitted to the Head-piece, made it look like an entire Helmet. Then to know whether it were Cutlaſs-proof, he drew his Sword, and try'd its edge upon the Paſteboard Vizor, but with the very firſt ſtroke he unluckily undid in a moment what he had been a whole week a doing. Now tho he found he had broke it with ſo little diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, he was not very well pleas'd to find he had loſt his labour; and therefore to ſecure it from the like accident, he made it anew, and fenc'd it with thin plates of Iron, which he fixt on the inſide of it ſo artificially, that at laſt he had reaſon to be ſatisfy'd with the ſolidity of the work, and ſo without any further Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment he reſolv'd it ſhou'd paſs for a full and ſufficient Helmet to all intents and purpoſes.</p>
                           <p>The next moment he went to view his Horſe,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54446:16"/>
whoſe Bones ſtuck out like the corners of a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Real, being a worſe Jade than <hi>Gonela</hi>'s; <hi>qui tantum pellis &amp; oſſa fuit:</hi> However, his Maſter thought that neither <hi>Alexander</hi>'s <hi>Buce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalus,</hi> nor the <hi>Cid</hi>'s <hi>Babieca</hi> cou'd be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with him. He was four days conſidering what Name to give him: For, as he argu'd with himſelf, there was no reaſon that a Horſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrid by ſo famous a Knight, and withal ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, ſhou'd not be diſtinguiſh'd by a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Name; and therefore he ſtudy d to give him ſuch a one as ſhou'd demonſtrate as well what kind of Horſe he had been before his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter was a Knight-Errant, as what he was now; thinking it but juſt, ſince the Owner chang'd his Profeſſion, that the Horſe ſhou'd alſo change his Title, and be dignified with another; a good big Word, ſuch a one as ſhou'd fill the Mouth, and ſeem conſonant with the quality and profeſſion of his Maſter. And thus, after many Names which he devis'd, blotted ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>, rejected, chang'd, lik'd, diſlik d and pitch d upon again, he concluded to call him<note n="*" place="bottom">
                                 <hi>Rozin</hi> commonly means an ordinary Horſe. <hi>Ante</hi> is before and formerly. Thus the word <hi>Rozinante</hi> may imply that he was formerly an ordinary Horſe, and alſo that he is now a Horſe that claims the precedence from all other ordinary Horſes.</note> 
                              <hi>Rozinante;</hi> a Name, in his opinion, lofty, ſounding, and ſignificant of what he had been before, and alſo of what he was now In a word, a Horſe <hi>before</hi> or <hi>above</hi> all the vulgar Breed of Horſes in the world.</p>
                           <p>When he had thus given his Horſe a name ſo much to his ſatisfaction, he thought of chuſing one for himſelf; and having ſeriouſly ponder'd on the matter eight whole days more, at laſt he
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54446:17"/>
determin'd to call himſelf <hi>Don Quixote.</hi> Whence the Authors of this moſt authentick Hiſtory draw this Inference, that his right name was <hi>Quixada,</hi> and not <hi>Queſada,</hi> as others obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pretend. And obſerving that the valiant <hi>Amadis,</hi> not ſatisfy'd with the bare appellation of <hi>Amadis,</hi> added to it the name of his Country, that it might grow more famous by his Exploits, and ſo ſtil'd himſelf <hi>Amadis de Gaule;</hi> ſo he, like a true lover of his native ſoil, reſolv'd to call himſelf <hi>Don Quixote de la Mancha;</hi> which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to his thinking, denoted very plainly his Parentage and Country, and conſequently wou'd fix a laſting honour on that part of the world.</p>
                           <p>And now his Armor being ſcowr'd, his Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece improv'd to a Helmet, his Horſe and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf new-nam'd, he perceiv'd he wanted nothing but a Lady, on whom he might beſtow the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of his Heart: For he was ſenſible that a Knight Errant without a Miſtreſs, was a Tree without either Fruit or Leaves, and a Body without a Soul. Shou'd I, ſaid he, by good or ill Fortune, chance to encounter ſome Giant, as 'tis common in Knight-Errantry, and happen to lay him proſtrate on the ground, transfix d with my Lance, or cleft in two, or in ſhort overcome him and have him at my mercy, wou'd it not be proper to have ſome Lady to whom I may ſend him as a Trophy of my Valour. Then when he comes into her preſence, throwing himſelf at her Feet, he may thus make his hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſubmiſſion: Lady, I am the Giant <hi>Caraculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambro,</hi> Lord of the Iſland of <hi>Malindrania,</hi> van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd in ſingle Combate by that never-deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly-enough-extoll'd Knight Errant <hi>Don Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> who has commanded me to caſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54446:17"/>
my ſelf moſt humbly at your Feet, that it may pleaſe your honor to diſpoſe of me according to your will. Oh how elevated was the Knight with the conceit of this imaginary ſubmiſſion of the Giant; eſpecially having withal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought himſelf of a perſon, on whom he might confer the Title of his Miſtreſs! which, 'tis believ'd happen'd thus. Near the place where he liv'd, dwelt a good likely Country Laſs, for whom he had formerly had a ſort of an inclination, tho 'tis believ'd ſhe never heard of it, nor perceiv'd it in the leaſt. Her name was <hi>Aldonca Lorenco;</hi> and this was ſhe whom he thought he might entitle to the Soveraignty of his Heart; upon which he ſtudied to find her out a new name, that might have ſome affinity with her old one, and yet at the ſame time ſound ſomewhat like that of a Princeſs or Lady of Quality: So at laſt he reſolv d to call her <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> with the addition of <hi>del Toboſo,</hi> from the place where ſhe was born: A name, in his opinion, ſweet, harmonious, extraordinary, and no leſs ſignificative than the others which he had devis'd.</p>

Nay, he alſo conſider'd, that tho he were already Knighted, it wou'd beeome him to wear white Armor, and not to adorn his Shield with any <hi>Deviſe,</hi> till he had deſerv'd one by ſome extraordinary demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his valour.</p>
                           <p>Theſe thoughts ſtagger'd his reſolution, but, his folly prevailing more than any reaſon, he reſolv'd to be dubb'd a Knight by the firſt he ſhou'd meet, after the example of ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who, as his diſtracting Romances inform'd him, had formerly done the like. As for the other difficulty about wearing white Armor, he propos'd to overcome it, by ſcowring his own at leiſure, till they ſhou'd look whiter than Ermines. And having thus diſmiſt theſe buſy ſcruples, he very calmly rode on, leaving
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54446:18"/>
it to his Horſes diſcretion to go which way he pleas'd, firmly believing, that in this conſiſted the very Being of Adventures; and as he thus went on, I cannot but believe, ſaid he to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that when the Hiſtory of my famous At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements ſhall be given to the World, the learned Author will begin it in this very man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, when he comes to give an account of this my early ſetting out. <q>Scarce had the ruddy-colour'd <hi>Phaebus</hi> begun to ſpread the golden Treſſes of his lovely hair, over the vaſt ſurface of the earthly Globe, and ſcarce had thoſe feather'd Poets of the Grove, the pretty painted Birds tuned their little Pipes, to ſing their early welcomes in ſoft melodious ſtrains, to the beautiful <hi>Aurora,</hi> who having left her jealous Husbands Bed, diſplayed her roſy Graces to mortal Eyes, from the Gates and Balconies of the horizon of <hi>La Mancha,</hi> when the renown'd Knight <hi>Don Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> diſdaining ſoft repoſe, forſook the voluptuous Down, and mounting his famous Steed <hi>Rozinante,</hi> entred the ancient and celebrated Plains of <hi>Montiel.</hi>
                              </q> This was indeed the very Road he took, and then proceeding, <q>O happy Age, O fortunate Times, cry'd he, decreed to uſher into the World my famous Atchievements, Atchievements worthy to be engraven on Braſs, carv'd in Marble, and delineated in ſome Maſter-piece of Painting, as ſome monuments of my Glory, and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples for Poſterity. And thou, venerable Sage, wiſe Enchanter, whatever be thy name, thou whom Fate has ordain'd to be the Compiler of this rare Hiſtory, forget not I beſeech thee my truſty <hi>Rozinante,</hi> the eternal Companion of all any Adventures. After this, as if he had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54446:19"/>
in Love; O, Princeſs <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> cry'd he, Lady of this captive heart, much Sorrow and Woe you have doom'd me to, in baniſhing me thus, and impoſing on me your rigorous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, never to appear before your Beauteous Face. Remember, Lady, that loyal heart your Slave, who for your Love ſubmits to ſo many miſeries.</q> To theſe extravagant conceits he added a world of others, all in imitation, and in the very ſtile of thoſe which the reading of Romances had furniſh'd him with: and all this while he rode ſo ſoftly, and the Sun's heat en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd ſo faſt, and was ſo violent, that it would have been ſufficient to have melted his Brains, had he had any left.</p>
                           <p>He travell'd almoſt all that day without meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any adventure worthy the trouble of rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which put him into a kind of Deſpair, for he deſired nothing more than to encounter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſome perſon on whom he might try the vigour of his arm.</p>
                           <p>Some Authors ſay that his firſt Adventure was that of the Paſs call'd <hi>Puerto Lapice;</hi> others, that of the Windmills; but all that I could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover of certainty in this matter, and that I meet with in the Annals of <hi>La Mancha,</hi> is, that he travell'd all that day, and towards the evening, he and his Horſe being heartily tir'd, and almoſt famiſh'd, <hi>Don Quixote</hi> looking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, in hopes to diſcover ſome Caſtle, or at leaſt ſome Shepherds Cottage, there to repoſe and refreſh himſelf, at laſt, near the Road which he kept, he eſpied an Inn; as welcome a ſight to his longing eyes as if he had diſcover'd a Star directing him to the Gate, nay, to the Palace of his Redemption. Thereupon haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54446:19"/>
towards the Inn with all the ſpeed he cou'd, he got thither juſt at the cloſe of the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. There ſtood by chance at the Inn-door two young Female-Adventurers, <hi>alias</hi> Common Wenches, who were going to <hi>Sevill</hi> with ſome Carriers that happen'd to take up their Lodging there that very evening; and as whatever our Knight-Errant ſaw, thought, or imagin'd, was all of a Romantick Caſt, and appear'd to him altogether after the manner of the Books that had perverted his Imagination, he no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſaw the Inn but he fancied it to be a Caſtle, fenc'd with four Towers, and lofty Pinacles glittering with Silver, together with a deep Mote, Draw-bridge, and all thoſe other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances peculiar to ſuch kind of places.</p>
                           <p>Therefore when he came near it, he ſtopt a while at a diſtance from the Gate, expecting that ſome Dwarf wou'd appear on the Battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſound his Trumpet, to give notice of the arrival of a Knight. But finding that no body came, and that <hi>Rozinante</hi> was for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the beſt of his way to the Stable, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd to the Inn door, where ſpying the two young Doxies, they ſeem'd to him two beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Damſels or graceful Ladies, taking the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the freſh Air at the Gate of the Caſtle. It happened alſo at the very moment, that a Swine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd chanced to Wind his Horn, to get his Hogs together, and <hi>Don Quixote</hi> preſently ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd, this was the wiſh'd-for ſignal, which ſome Dwarf gave to notify his approach; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with the greateſt joy in the world he rode up to the Inn. The Wenches, affrighted at the approach of a man cas'd in Iron, and arm'd with a Lance and Target, were for run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54446:20"/>
in to their Lodging; but <hi>Don Quixote</hi> perceiving their fear by their flight, lifted up the Paſteboard Beaver of his Helmet, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering his wither'd duſty Face, with comely Grace and grave Delivery, accoſted 'em in this manner. I beſeech ye Ladies do not fly, nor fear the leaſt offence; the Order of Knighthood which I profeſs, does not permit me to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance or offer injuries to any one in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and leaſt of all to perſons of your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's exalted Rank and Merit. The Wenches look'd earneſtly upon him, endeavouring to ſee his Face, which his ill contriv'd Beaver partly hid; but when they heard themſelves thus complimented with the Title of Ladyſhip, an honor to which their condition never had the leaſt pretence, they cou'd not forbear laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing outright, which <hi>Don Quixote</hi> reſented as a great affront. Give me leave to tell ye, Ladies, cry'd he, that Modeſty and Civility are very becoming in the fair Sex; whereas laughter without ground is the higheſt piece of Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion; however, added he, I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to ſay this to offend you or incur your diſpleaſure. No, Ladies, I aſſure you I have no other deſign but to do you ſervice. This uncommon way of Expreſſion, joyn'd to the Knight's ſcurvy Figure, increas'd their Mirth, which incens'd him to that degree, that this might have carry'd things to an extremity, had not the Inn-keeper luckily appear'd at that jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. He was a man whoſe Burthen of Fat inclin'd him to peace and quietneſs, yet when he had obſerv'd ſuch a ſtrange diſguiſe of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Shape, in his odd Armor and Equipage, he cou'd hardly forbear keeping the Wenches
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54446:20"/>
company in their laughter. But having the fear of ſuch a Warlike appearance before his eyes, he reſolv'd to give him good words, and therefore accoſting him civilly, Sir Knight, ſaid he, if your Worſhip be diſpos'd to alight, you will fail of nothing here but of a Bed; as for all other accommodations, you may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to your mind. <hi>Don Quixote</hi> obſerving the humility of the Governour of the Caſtle, (for ſuch the Inn-keeper and Inn ſeem'd to him) <hi>Senior Caſtillano,</hi> ſaid he, the leaſt thing in the world ſuffices me; for Arms are the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things I value, and Combat is my Bed of Repoſe. The Inn-keeper thought he had call'd him<note n="*" place="bottom">

                              <hi>Caſtillano,</hi> as taking him to be one of the true <hi>Caſtillans,</hi> whereas he was indeed of <hi>Andaluzia,</hi> nay, of the neighbourhood of <hi>St Lucar,</hi> no leſs thieviſh than <hi>Cacus,</hi> nor leſs miſchievous than a truant Scholar, or a Court Page, and therefore he made him this reply. <q>At this rate, Sir Knight, your Bed might be a Pavement, and your reſt to be ſtill awake; you may then ſafely alight, and I dare aſſure you, you can hardly miſs being kept awake all the year long in this houſe, and much leſs one ſingle night.</q> With that he went and held <hi>Don Quixote</hi>'s Stirrup, who not having broke his Faſt that day, diſmounted with no ſmall trouble or difficulty. He immediately deſired the Governor, (that is the Inn-keeper) to have ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54446:21"/>
care of his Steed, aſſuring him, that there was not a better in the Univerſe. Upon which the Inn-keeper view'd him narrowly, but cou'd not think him to be half ſo good as <hi>Don Quixote</hi> ſaid; however, having ſet him up in the Stable, he came back to the Knight, to ſee what he wanted, and found him pulling off his Armour, by the help of the good natur'd Wenches, who had already reconcil'd themſelves to him; but tho they had eaſed him of his Corſlet and Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate, they cou'd by no means undo his Gorget, nor take off his ill contriv'd Beaver, which he had ty'd ſo faſt with green Ribbons, that 'twas impoſſible to get it off without cutting 'em. Now he wou'd by no means permit that, and ſo was forc'd to keep on his Helmet all Night, which was one of the moſt pleaſant ſights in the World. And while his Armour was taking off by the two kind Laſſes, imagining 'em to be Perſons of Quality, and Ladies of that Caſtle, he very gracefully made 'em the following com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment. [in imitation of an old Romance]

                           <p>O <hi>Rozinante!</hi> for that is my Horſes Name, Ladies, and mine <hi>Don Quixote de la Mancha</hi> I never thought to have diſcover'd it, till ſome Feats of Arms atchiev'd by me in your ſervice, had made me better known to your Ladiſhips; But neceſſity forcing me to apply to my preſent
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54446:21"/>
purpoſe, that paſſage of the ancient Romance of Sir <hi>Lancelot,</hi> which I now repeated, has extorted the ſecret from me, before its time. Yet a day will come, when you ſhall command, and I obey, and then the Valor of my Arm ſhall evince the reality of my Zeal to ſerve your Ladiſhips.</p>
                           <p>The two Females, who were not uſed to ſuch Rhetorical Speeches, cou'd make no anſwer to this, they only ask'd him, whether he wou'd eat any thing? That I will, with all my Heart, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> whatever it be, for I'm of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nothing can come to me more ſeaſonably. Now as ill luck wou'd have it, it happened to be <hi>Friday,</hi> and there was nothing to be had at the Inn, but ſome pieces of Fiſh, which is call'd <hi>Abadexo</hi> in <hi>Caſtile, Bacallao</hi> in <hi>Andaluzia, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radillo</hi> in ſome places, and in others <hi>Truchuela</hi> or <hi>Little Trout,</hi> tho after all 'tis but <hi>Poor John:</hi> ſo they ask'd him, whether he cou d eat any of that <hi>Truchuela,</hi> becauſe they had no other Fiſh to give him. <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> imagining they meant ſmall Trout, told 'em that provided there were more than one, 'twas the ſame thing to him, they wou'd ſerve him as well as a great one; for, continu'd he, 'tis all one to me, whether I am paid a Piece of Eight in one ſingle Piece, or in eight ſmall Reals, which are worth as much. Beſides, 'tis probable theſe <hi>Small Trouts</hi> may be like Veal, which is finer Meat than Beef, or like the Kid, which is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the Goat. In ſhort, let it be what it will, ſo it comes quickly; for the weight of Armor and the fatigue of Travel, are not to be ſupported without recreating Food. Thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they laid the Cloath at the Inn-door, for the benefit of the freſh air; and the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54446:22"/>
brought him a piece of that Salt-fiſh, but ill water'd, and as ill dreſt, and as for the Bread 'twas as mouldy and brown as the Knights Armour. But 'twou'd have made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one laugh to have ſeen him eat; for having his Helmet on, with his Beaver lifted up, 'twas impoſſible for him to feed himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out help, and one of the kind Wenches had that office; but there was no giving him Drink that way, and he muſt have gone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, had not the Inn-keeper bor'd a Cane, and, ſetting one end of it to his Mouth, pour'd the Wine in at the other; all which the Knight ſuffer'd patiently, becauſe he would not cut the Ribbonds that faſten'd his Helmet.</p>
                           <p>While he was at Supper, a Sow-gelder happen'd to Wind his<note n="*" place="margin">Silvato de Cannas.</note> Inſtrument four or five times, as he came near the Inn, which made <hi>Don Quixote</hi> the more poſitive of his being in a famous Caſtle, where he was entertain'd with Muſic at Supper, that the <hi>Poor Jack</hi> was young <hi>Trout,</hi> the Bread of the fineſt Flower, the Wenches great Ladies, and the Inn keeper the Governour of the Caſtle: Which made him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud himſelf for his Reſolution, and his ſetting out on ſuch an account. The only thing that vext him, was, that he was not yet dubb'd a Knight; for he fancy'd he cou'd not lawfully undertake any Adventure till he had receiv'd the Order of Knighthood.</p>

                              <hi>DOn Quixote</hi>'s mind being diſturb'd with that thought, out of his ſhort Ordinary he made yet a ſhorter Supper; and as ſoon as he had done he call'd his Hoſt, then ſhut him and himſelf up in the Stable, and falling at his feet, I will never riſe from this place, cry'd he, moſt Valorous Knight, till you have graciouſly vouchſaf'd to grant me a Boon which I will now beg of you, and which will redound to your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and the good of mankind. The Inn-keeper, ſtrangely at a loſs to find his Gueſt at his feet, and talking at this rate, endeavour'd to make him riſe, but all in vain, till he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to grant him what he ask'd. I expected no leſs from your great magnificence, noble Sir, reply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> and therefore I make bold to tell you, that the Boon which I beg, and you generouſly condeſcend to grant me, is, that to morrow you will be pleas'd to beſtow the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Knighthood upon me. This night I will watch my Armor in the Chappel of your Caſtle, and then in the morning you ſhall grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie me, as I paſſionately deſire, that I may be duly qualified to ſeek out Adventures in every corner of the Univerſe, to relieve the Diſtreſſed, according to the Laws of Chivalry, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of Knights-Errant like my ſelf.

He added, that this Caſtle at preſent had
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54446:23"/>
no Chappel where the Knight might keep the Vigil of his Arms, it being pull'd down, in order to be new built; but that he knew they might lawfully be watch'd in any other place in a caſe of neceſſity; and therefore he might do it that night in the Court-yard of the Caſtle: and in the morning all the neceſſary Ceremonies ſhou'd be perform'd, ſo that he might aſſure himſelf he ſhou'd be dubb'd a Knight, nay, as much a Knight as any one in the world cou'd be; he then ask'd <hi>Don Quixote</hi> whether he had any Money? Not a Croſs, reply'd the Knight, for I never read in any Hiſtory of Chivalry that any Knight-Errant ever carry'd Money about him.

But when they wanted ſuch a Friend in former
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54446:24"/>
Ages, the Knights thought themſelves oblig'd to take care, that their Squires ſhou'd be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with Money and other Neceſſaries, as Lint and Salves to dreſs their Wounds; and if thoſe Knights ever happen'd to have no Squires, which was but very ſeldom, then they carry'd thoſe things behind 'em in a little Bag, as if it had been ſomething of greater value, and ſo neatly fitted to their Saddle, that it was hardly ſeen, for had it not been upon ſuch an account, the carrying of a Bag was not much allow'd among Knights-Errant. I muſt therefore ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe you, continu'd he, nay I might even charge and command you, as you are ſhortly to be my Son in Chivalry, never from this time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to ride without Money, nor without the other neceſſaries, of which I ſpoke to you, which you will find very beneficial, when you leaſt expect it. <hi>Don Quixote</hi> promis'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form very punctually all his Injunctions: and ſo they diſpos'd every thing in order to his watching his Arms in a great yard, that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd to the Inn. To which purpoſe, the Knight having got 'em all together, laid 'em in a Horſe-trough cloſe by a Well in that Yard, then bracing his Target, and graſping his Lance, juſt as it grew dark, he began to walk about by the Horſe-trough, with a graceful deportment. In the mean while the Inn-keeper acquainted all thoſe that were in the Houſe, with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies of his gueſt, his watching his Arms, and his hopes of being made a Knight; they all admir d very much at ſo ſtrange a kind of Folly, and went out to obſerve him at a diſtance; where they ſaw him ſometimes walk about with a great deal of gravity, and ſometimes
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54446:24"/>
lean on his Lance, with his eyes all the while fixt upon his Arms. 'Twas now undoubted Night, but yet the Moon did ſhine with ſuch a brightneſs, as might almoſt have vy'd with that of the Planet which lent it her; ſo that the Knight was wholly expos'd to the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors view. While he was thus employ'd, one of the Carriers, who lodged in the Inn, came out to water his Mules, which he cou'd not do without removing the Arms out of the Trough. With that <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> who ſaw him make to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, cry'd out to him aloud, O thou, who e're thou art, raſh Knight, that prepares to lay thy hands on the Arms of the moſt valorous Errant that ever wore a Sword, take heed! Do not audaciouſly attempt to prophane 'em with a Touch, leſt inſtant Death be the too ſure reward of thy Temerity. But the Carrier never regarded theſe dreadful Threats, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold on the Armor, by the Straps, without any more a do threw it a good way from him; tho it had been better for him to have let it alone; for <hi>Don Quixote</hi> no ſooner ſaw this, but lifting up his eyes to heaven, and addreſſing his thoughts, as it ſeem'd, to his Lady <hi>Dulcinea;</hi> Aſſiſt me, Lady, cry'd he, in this firſt opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity that offers it ſelf to your faithful Slave, nor let your Favour and Protection be deny'd me in this firſt tryal of my Valour. Repeating ſuch like Ejaculations, he let ſlip his Target, and lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his Lance with both his hands, he gave the Carrier ſuch a terrible knock on his inconſiderate head with his Lance, that he laid him at his Feet in a woful condition, and had he back d that Blow with another, the Fellow wou'd certainly have had no need of a Surgeon. This done, <hi>Don
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54446:25"/>
Quixote</hi> took up his Armor, laid it again in the Horſe-trough, and then walk'd on backwards and forwards, with as great an unconcern as he did at firſt.</p>
                           <p>Soon after, another Carrier, not knowing what had happen'd, came alſo to water his Mules, while the firſt lay yet on the ground in a Trance; but as he offer'd to clear the Trough of the Armor, <hi>Don Quixote</hi> without ſpeaking a word, or imploring any one's aſſiſtance, once more dropt his Target, lifted up his Lance, and then let it fall ſo heavily on the Fellows head, that he broke it in three or four places. His outcry ſoon alarm'd, and brought thither all the People in the Inn, and the Landlord among the reſt; which <hi>Don Quixote</hi> perceiving, Thou Queen of Beauty (cry'd he, bracing on his Shield, and drawing his Sword) Thou Courage and Vigor of my weakn'd heart, now is the time, when thou muſt enliven thy adventurous Slave, with the Beams of thy greatneſs, while this moment he is engaging in ſo terrible an Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. With this, in his opinion, he found himſelf ſupplyed with ſuch an addition of Courage, that had all the Carriers in the world at once at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tackt him, he wou'd undauntedly have fac'd 'em all. On the other ſide, the Carriers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd to ſee their Comrades thus us'd, tho they were afraid to come near, gave the Knight ſuch a Volly of Stones, that he was forc'd to ſhelter himſelf as well as he could under the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert of his Target, without daring to go far from the Horſe-trough, leſt he ſhou'd ſeem to abandon his Arms. The Inn-keeper call'd to the Carriers as loud as he cou'd, to let him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, that he had told 'em already he was
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54446:25"/>
mad, and conſequently the Law wou'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit him tho he ſhou'd kill 'em. <hi>Don Quixote</hi> alſo made yet more noiſe, calling 'em falſe and treacherous Villains, and the Lord of the Caſtle, baſe and inhoſpitable, and a diſcourte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Knight, for ſuffering a Knight-Errant to be be ſo abus'd; I wou'd make thee know, cry'd he, what a perfidious wretch thou art, had I but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Order of Knighthood. But for you, baſe, ignominious Rabble! Fling on! Do your worſt! Come on, draw nearer, if you dare, and receive the Reward of your Indiſcretion and Inſolence. This he ſpoke with ſo much ſpirit and undauntedneſs, that he ſtruck a terror into all his aſſailants; ſo that partly thro fear, and partly thro the Inn-keepers perſuaſions, they gave over flinging Stones at him; and he on his ſide permitted the Enemy to carry off their wounded, and then return'd to the guard of his Arms as calm and compos'd as before.</p>
                           <p>The Inn-keeper, who began ſomewhat to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reliſh theſe mad tricks of his Gueſt, reſolv'd to diſpatch him forthwith, and beſtow on him that unlucky Knighthood, to prevent further miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief: So, coming to him, he excus'd himſelf for the Inſolence of thoſe baſe Scoundrels, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done without his privity or conſent; but their audaciouſneſs, he ſaid, was ſufficiently pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd. He added, that he had already told him there was no Chappel in his Caſtle, and that indeed there was no need of one to finiſh the reſt of the Ceremony of Knighthood, which conſiſted only in the application of the Sword to the Neck and Shoulders, as he had read in the Regiſter af the Ceremonies of the Order; and that this might be perform'd as well in a

                           <p>
                              <hi>A<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rora</hi> began to uſher in the Morn, when <hi>Don Quixote</hi> ſallied out of the Inn, ſo well pleas'd, ſo gay, and ſo overjoy'd to find himſelf Knighted, that he infus'd the ſame ſatisfaction into his Horſe, who ſeem'd ready to burſt his Girts for joy. But calling to mind the admonitions, which the Inn-keeper had given him, concerning the Proviſion of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary accommodation in his Travels, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly Money and clean Shirts, he reſolv d to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home, to furniſh himſelf with them, and likewiſe get him a Squire, deſigning to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain as ſuch, a Labouring Man his Neighbour, who was poor, and had a charge of Children; but yet very fit for the office. With this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he took the Road, that led to his own Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, and <hi>Rozinante,</hi> that ſeem'd to know his Will by inſtinct, began to carry him a round Trot, ſo briskly, that his Heels ſeem'd ſcarcely to touch the ground. The Knight had not travell'd far when he fancied he heard an effeminate Voice, complaining in a Thicket on his right hand; <q>I thank Heaven, ſaid he, when he heard the cryes, for favouring me ſo ſoon with an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to perform the Duty of my Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and reap the Fruit of my deſires!

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54446:28"/>
ſome diſtreſs'd Creature, who wants my preſent help.</q> Then turning to that ſide, with all the ſpeed which <hi>Rozinante</hi> cou'd make, he no ſooner came into the Wood, but he found a Mare ty'd to an Oak, and to another a young Lad about fifteen years of Age, naked from the waſte upwards. This was he who made ſuch a lamentable outcry, and not without cauſe; for a luſty Country Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low was ſtrapping him ſoundly with a Girdle, at every ſtripe putting him in mind of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>Keep your Mouth ſhut, and your Eyes open, Sirrah:</hi> Good Maſter cry'd the Boy, I'll do ſo no more, as I hope to be ſav'd, I'll never do ſo again! Indeed Maſter, hereafter I'll take more care of your Goods. <hi>Don Quixote</hi> ſeeing this cry'd in an angry tone, <q>Diſcourteous Knight, 'tis an unworthy act, to ſtrike a perſon who is not able to defend himſelf: Come, beſtride thy Steed, and take thy Lance (for the Farmer had ſomething that look'd like one, teſting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame Tree, to which his Mare was ty'd,) then I'll make thee know, thou haſt acted the part of a Coward.</q> The Country Fellow, who gave himſelf for loſt, at the ſight of an apparition in Armour brandiſhing his Lance at his Face, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd him in mild and ſubmiſſive words: <q>Sir Knight, cry'd he, this Boy whom I am chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing is my Servant, imploy'd by me to look after a flock of Sheep which I have not far off, but he's ſo heedleſs that I loſe ſome of 'em eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day. Now becauſe I correct him for his Careleſneſs, or his Knavery, he ſays I do it out of Covetouſneſs, to defraud him of his wages; but upon my Life and Soul he belies me. What, the Lye in my preſenee, you ſaucy Clown, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> by the Sun that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54446:29"/>
ſhines I've a good mind to run thee thro the Body with my Lance! Pay the Boy this inſtant, without any more words; or by the power that rules us all, I'll immediately diſpatch and annihilate thee. Come, unbind him this moment.</q> The Countryman hung down his head, and without any further reply unbound the Boy, who being ask'd by <hi>Don Quixote</hi> what his Maſter ow'd him, told him, 'twas nine months Wages, at ſeven Reals a month. The Knight having caſt it up, found it came to ſixty three Reals in all; which he ordered the Farmer to pay the Fellow immediately, unleſs he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to loſe his life that very moment. The poor Countryman trembling for fear, told him, that, as he was on the brink of Death, by the Oath he had ſworn (by the by he had not yet ſworn at all) he did not owe the Lad ſo much; for there was to be deducted for three pair of Shooes which he had bought him, and a Real for his being let blood twice when he was ſick. That may be, reply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> but ſet the price of the Shoes, and the Bleeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſtripes which you have given him without cauſe; for if he has us'd the Shooe-Leather which you paid for, you have in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn miſus'd and impair'd his skin ſufficiently; and if the Surgeon let him blood when he was ſick, you have drawn blood from him now he is in health, ſo that he owes you nothing on that account. The worſt is, Sir Knight, cry d the Farmer, that I have no Money about me, but let <hi>Andrew</hi> go home with me, and I ll pay him every Piece out of hand. What! I go with him, cry'd the youngſter, the Devil a bit, Sir! Not I, truly, I know better things;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54446:29"/>
for he'd no ſooner have me by himſelf, but he'd flea me alive like another St <hi>Bartholomew.</hi> He will never dare to do it, reply'd <hi>Don Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote;</hi> I command him, and that's ſufficient to reſtrain him; therefore provided he will ſwear by the Order of Knighthood which has been conferr'd upon him, that he will duly obſerve this regulation, I will freely let him go, and then thou art ſecure of thy Money. Good Sir, take heed what you ſay, cry'd the Boy; for my Maſter is no Knight, nor ever was of any Order in his life: He's <hi>John Haldudo,</hi> the rich Farmer of <hi>Quintanar.</hi> This ſignifies little an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd <hi>Don Quixote;</hi> for there may be Knights among the <hi>Haldudo's;</hi> beſides, the brave man is his own Herald, and every man the Son of his own works. That's true, Sir, quoth <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew;</hi> but of what works can this Maſter of mine be the Son, who denies me my wages which I have earn'd with the ſweat of my Brows. I do not deny thee to pay thee thy wages, honeſt <hi>Andrew,</hi> cry'd the Maſter, be but ſo kind as to go along with me, and by all the Orders of Knighthood in the world, I ſwear, I'll pay thee every piece, as I ſaid, nay, and ſweet ſcented to boot. <q>You may ſpare your perfume, ſaid <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> do but pay him in Reals, and I am ſatisfy'd; but be ſure you perform your Oath; for if you fail, I my ſelf ſwear by the ſame Oath, to return, and find you out, and puniſh you, though you ſhou'd hide your ſelf as cloſe as a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard: and if you wou'd be inform'd who 'tis that lays theſe injunctions on you, that you may underſtand how highly it concerns you to obſerve 'em, know I am the valorous <hi>Don
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54446:30"/>
Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> the righter of wrongs, and avenger and redreſſer of grievances; and ſo farewel; but remember what you have promis'd and ſworn, as you will anſwer the contrary at your peril.</q> This ſaid, he clapt Spurs to <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and quickly left the Maſter and the Man a good way behind him.</p>
                           <p>The Countryman, who follow'd him with both his Eyes, no ſooner perceiv'd that he was paſt the Wood, and quite out of ſight, but he went back to his Boy <hi>Andrew.</hi> Come, Child, ſaid he, I will pay thee what I owe thee, as that righter of wrongs and redreſſer of grievances has order'd me. Ay, quoth <hi>Andrew,</hi> on my word, you'll do well to fulfill the Commands of that good Knight, whom Heaven grant long to live; for he is ſo brave a Man, and ſo juſt a Judge, that adad if you don't pay me, he'll come back, and make his Words good. I dare ſwear as much, anſwer'd the Maſter; and to ſhow thee how much I love thee, I am willing to encreaſe the Debt, that I may enlarge the payment; with that he caught the youngſter by the Arm, and ty'd him again to the Tree, where he handled him ſo unmercifully, that ſcarce any ſigns of Life were left in him. Now call your righter of wrongs, Mr <hi>Andrew,</hi> cry d the Farmer, and you ſhall ſee, he'll ne re be able to undo what I have done, tho I fancy 'tis but part of what I am to do; for I have a good mind to flea you alive, as you ſaid I wou'd, you Raſcal. However, he unty'd him at laſt, and gave him leave to go and ſeek out his Judge, in order to get his Decree put in Execution. <hi>Andrew</hi> went his ways not very well pleas'd you may be ſure, yet fully reſolv d to find out the valorous <hi>Don Quixote de la Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha,</hi>
                              <pb n="33" facs="tcp:54446:30"/>
and give him an exact account of the whole Tranſaction, that he might pay the abuſe with ſevenfold uſury. In ſhort, he crept off ſobbing and weeping, while his Maſter ſtaid behind laughing; and in this manner was this wrong redreſs'd by the valorous <hi>Don Quixote de la Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In the mean time, being highly pleas'd with himſelf, and what had happen'd, imagining he had had given a moſt fortunate and noble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to his Feats of Arms, as he went on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Village, <q>O moſt Beautiful of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſaid he with a low voice, <hi>Dulcinea del To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſo,</hi> well may'ſt thou deem thy ſelf moſt happy, ſince 'twas thy good fortune to capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and hold a willing Slave to thy deſires, ſo valorous and renown'd a Knight as is, and ever ſhall be <hi>Don Quixote de la Mancha;</hi> who, as all the world knows, had the order of Knighthood beſtowed on him but yeſterday, and this day redreſſed the greateſt wrong and grievance that ever Injuſtice cou'd deſign, or Cruelty commit: This day has he wreſted the Scourge out of the hands of that Tormentor, who ſo unmercifully treated a tender Infant without the leaſt occaſion given.</q> Juſt as he had ſaid this, he found himſelf at a place where four Roads met; and this made him preſently bethink himſelf of thoſe Croſs ways which often us'd to put Knights-Errant to a ſtand, to conſult with themſelves which way they ſhou'd take; and that he might follow their Example, he ſtopp'd a while, and after he had ſeriouſly reflected on the matter, he gave <hi>Rozinante</hi> the Reins, ſubjecting his own Will to that of his Horſe, who purſuing his firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54446:31"/>
took the way that led to his own Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Don Quixote</hi> had not gone above two miles, but he diſcover'd a great Company of people riding towards him, who prov'd to be Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of <hi>Toledo,</hi> that were going to buy Silks in <hi>Murcia:</hi> They were ſix in all, every one skreen'd with his Umbrella, beſides four Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants on Horſeback, and three Muleteers on Foot. The Knight no ſooner perceiv'd 'em, but he imagin'd this to be ſome new Adventure, and becauſe he was reſolv'd to imitate as much as poſſible the paſſages which he had read in his Books, he was pleas'd to repreſent this to himſelf as ſuch a particular Adventure, as he had a ſingular deſire to meet with; and ſo, with a dreadful grace and aſſurance, fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf in his Stirrups, couching his Lance, and covering his Breaſt with his Target, he poſted himſelf in the middle of the Road, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the coming up of the ſuppos'd Knights-Errant. As ſoon as they came within hearing, with a loud Voice and a haughty Tone, hold, cry'd he, <q>Let all Mankind ſtand, nor hope to paſs on further, unleſs all Mankind acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and confeſs, that there is not in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe a more beautiful Damſel than the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs of <hi>La Mancha,</hi> the peerleſs <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo.</hi>
                              </q> At thoſe words the Merchants made a halt, to view the unaccountable Figure of their Opponent, and eaſily conjecturing both by his expreſſion and his diſguiſe, that the poor Gentleman had loſt his Sences, they were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to underſtand the meaning of that ſtrange confeſſion, which he wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and underſtood Raillery, having diſcretion to manage it, undertook to talk to him. <q>Sir Knight, cry'd he, we do not know this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Lady whom you talk of; but be pleas'd to let us ſee her, and then if we find her poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of thoſe matchleſs Charms of which you aſſert her to be the Miſtreſs, we will freely and without the leaſt compulſion own the truth which you wou'd extort from us. Had I once ſhew'd you that Beauty, reply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> what wonder wou'd it be to have you acknowledge ſo notorious and evident a Truth? The Importance of the thing lies in obliging you to believe it, confeſs it, affirm it, ſwear it, and maintain it, without ſeeing her, and therefore make this acknowledgment this very moment, or know, 'tis with me you muſt joyn in Battle, 'ye proud and unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Mortals. Come one by one, as the Laws of Chivalry require, or all at once, according to the diſhonourable Practice of men of your Stamp, here I expect you all my ſingle ſelf, and will ſtand the encounter, confiding in the Juſtice of my Cauſe. Sir Knight, reply'd the Merchant, I beſeech you in the name of us all the Princes here preſent, that for the diſcharge of our Conſciences, which will not permit us to affirm a thing we never heard or ſaw, and which beſides, tends ſo much to the diſhonour of the Empreſſes and Queens of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carria,</hi> and <hi>Eſtremadura,</hi> your Worſhip will vouchſafe to let us ſee ſome Portraiture of that Lady, though 'twere no bigger than a grain of Wheat; for by a ſmall ſample we may judge of the whole piece, and by that means reſt ſecure and ſatisfy'd, and you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented

and appeas'd. Nay, I verily believe, that we all find our ſelves already ſo inclinable to comply with you, that tho her Picture ſhou'd repreſent her to be blind of one Eye, and diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Vermillion and Brimſtone at the other, yet to oblige you, we ſhou'd be ready to ſay in her Favor, whatever your Worſhip deſires. Diſtil, ye infamous Scoundrels, reply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> in a burning Rage! Diſtil, ſay you? Know that nothing diſtils from her but Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and Civit. Neither is ſhe defective in her Eyes or Shape; but more ſtrait than a <hi>Guadaramian</hi> Spindle. But you ſhall all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely pay for the horrid Blaſphemy which thou haſt utter'd againſt the tranſcendent Beauty of my incomparable Lady.</q> Saying this, with his Lance couch'd, he ran ſo furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly at the Merchant who had thus provok'd him, that had not good fortune ſo order'd it that <hi>Rozinante</hi> ſhould ſtumble, and fall in the midſt of his Career, the audacious Trifler had paid dear for his Raillery. But as <hi>Rozinante</hi> fell, he threw down his Maſter, who roll'd and tumbled a good way on the ground, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being able to get upon his Legs, tho he us'd all his skill and ſtrength to effect it; ſo encumbred he was with his Lance, Target, Spurs, Helmet, and the weight of his ruſty Armor. However, in this helpleſs condition, he play'd the Hero wirh his Tongue, Stay, cry'd he, Cowards, Raſcals, do not fly! 'Tis not thro my fault that I lye here, but thro that of my Horſe, ye Poltroons.</p>
                           <p>One of the Grooms, who was none of the beſt natur'd Creatures, hearing the overthrown Knight thus inſolently treat his Maſter, could

His Maſter indeed call'd to him, not to lay him on ſo vigorouſly, and to let him alone; but the Fellow, whoſe hand was in, wou'd not give over rib-roaſting the Knight, till he had tir'd out his paſſion and himſelf; and therefore run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the other pieces of the broken Lance, he fell to't again without ceaſing, till he had ſplinter'd them all on the poor Knight's Iron-Encloſure. He on his ſide, notwithſtanding all this ſtorm of Baſtinadoes, lay all the while bellowing, threatning Heaven and Earth, and thoſe villanous Ruffians, as he took 'em to be. At laſt the Mule-driver was tir'd, and the Merchants purſu'd their Journey, ſufficiently furniſh'd with matter of Diſcourſe, at the poor Knights ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. When he found himſelf alone, he try'd once more to get on his feet; but if he cou'd not do it when he had the uſe of all his limbs, how ſhou'd he do it now, bruis'd and batter'd as he was. But yet for all this, he eſteem'd himſelf a happy man, being ſtill perſwaded that his misfortune was one of thoſe accidents com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in Knight-Errantry; and ſuch a one as he cou'd wholly attribute to the falling of his Horſe; nor cou'd he poſſibly get up, ſo ſore and mortify'd was his Body all over.</p>

When kind Fortune ſo order'd it, that a Plow-man, who liv'd in the ſame Village, and near his Houſe, happen'd to paſs by, as he came from the Mill with a ſack of Wheat. The Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſeeing a Man lye at his full length on the ground, ask'd him, who he was, and why he made ſuch a ſad complaint? <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> whoſe diſtemper'd Brain preſently repreſented to him the Country-man for the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> his imaginary Unkle, made him no anſwer, but went on with the Romance, giving him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his misfortunes, and of the Loves of his Wife, and the Emperors Son, juſt as the Book relates 'em. The Fellow ſtar'd, much amaz'd to hear a man talk ſuch unaccountable ſtuff, and taking off the viſor of his Helmet, broken all to pieces, with the blows beſtow'd upon't by the Mule-driver, he wip'd off the Duſt that cover'd his Face, and preſently knew the Gentleman. Maſter <hi>Quixada,</hi> cry'd he! (for ſo he was properly called, when he had the right uſe of his ſences, and had not yet from a ſober Gentleman, transform'd himſelf into a wandring Knight) how came you in this Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? but the other continu'd his Romance, and made no anſwers to all the Queſtions the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman put to him; but what follow'd in courſe in the Book. Which the good man perceiving, he took off the batter'd Adventurer's Armor, as well as he cou'd, and fell a ſearching for his Wounds, but finding no ſign of any Blood, or other hurt, he endeavour'd to ſet him upon his
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54446:34"/>
Legs; and at laſt with a great deal of trouble, he heav'd him upon his Aſs, as being the more eaſy and gentle Carriage, he alſo got all the Knights Arms together, not leaving behind ſo much as the ſplinters of his Lance, and having ty'd 'em up, and laid 'em on <hi>Rozinante,</hi> which he took by the Bridle, and his Aſs by the Halter, he led 'em all towards the Village, and trudg'd afoot himſelf very penſive, while he reflected on the extravagancies, which he heard <hi>Don Quixote</hi> utter: nor was <hi>Don Quixote</hi> himſelf leſs melancholick, for he felt himſelf ſo bruis'd and mortify'd, that he cou d hardly ſit on the Aſs, and now and then he breath'd ſuch grievous ſighs, as ſeem'd to pierce the very skies; which mov'd his compaſſionate Neighbour once more to entreat him, to declare to him the cauſe of his grief. But one wou'd have imagin'd the Devil prompted him with Stories, that had ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of his circumſtances, for in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, wholly forgetting <hi>Baldwin,</hi> he bethought himſelf of the Moor <hi>Abindaraez,</hi> when <hi>Rodrigo de Narvaez,</hi> Alcayde of <hi>Antequera,</hi> took and carried him Priſoner to his Caſtle; ſo that when the Husbandman ask'd him again, how he did, and what ail'd him, he anſwer'd word for word, as the Priſoner <hi>Abencerrage,</hi> replies to <hi>Rodrigo de Narvaez,</hi> in the <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>George de Monte-Mayor,</hi> where that Adventure is related; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying it ſo properly to his purpoſe, that the Countryman curs'd himſelf to the Pit of Hell, for hearing his ſtrange Nonſence; and being now fully convinced, that his Neighbours Brains were turn'd, he made all the haſte he cou'd to the Village, to be rid of his tedious and troubleſom impertinences. <hi>Don Quixote</hi> in the mean time,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54446:34"/>
thus went on, You muſt know, Don <hi>Rodrigo de Narvaez,</hi> that this Beautiful <hi>Xerifa,</hi> of whom I gave you an account, is at preſent the moſt lovely <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo,</hi> for whoſe ſake I have done, ſtill do, and will atchieve the moſt famous Deeds of Chivalry that ever were, are, or ever ſhall be ſeen in the Univerſe. Good Sir, reply'd the Husband-man, do you not plainly perceive that I am neither <hi>Don Rodrigo de Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaez,</hi> nor the Marquis of <hi>Mantua,</hi> but only a poor Sinner, <hi>Pedro Alonſo</hi> by name, your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Neighbour? Nor are you <hi>Baldwin,</hi> nor <hi>Abindaraez,</hi> but only that worthy Gentleman Senior <hi>Quixada.</hi> I know very well who I am, anſwer'd <hi>Don Quixote;</hi> and what's more, I know that I may not only be the perſons I have nam'd, but alſo the Twelve Peers of <hi>France,</hi> nay, and the nine Worthies all in one; ſince my Atchievements will out-rival not only the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Exploits which made any of 'em ſingly Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious, but all their mighty Deeds accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated together.</p>
                           <p>Thus diſcourſing, they at laſt got near their Village about Sun-ſet; but the Country-man ſtaid at ſome diſtance till 'twas dark, that the diſtreſſed Gentleman might not be ſeen ſo ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily mounted, and then he led him home to his own houſe, which he found in great confuſion. The Curate and the Barber of the Village, both of 'em <hi>Don Quixote</hi>'s intimate acquaintance, happen'd to be there at that juncture, as alſo the Houſe-keeper, who was aguing with 'em. What do you think, pray good Doctor <hi>Perez,</hi> ſaid ſhe, (for this was the Curates Name) what do you think of my Maſters miſchance? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he, nor his Horſe, nor his Target, Lance,

nor Armor have been ſeen theſe ſix days. What ſhall I do, wretch that I am? I dare lay my Life, and 'tis as ſure as I am a living Creature, that thoſe curſed Books of Errantry, which he us'd to be always poring upon, have ſet him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his Sences; for now I remember I have heard him often mutter to himſelf, that he had a mind to turn Knight Errant, and jaunt up and down the world to find out Adventures. May <hi>Sathan</hi> and <hi>Barrabas</hi> e'en take all ſuch Books that have thus crackt the beſt Head-piece in all <hi>La Mancha!</hi> His Neice ſaid as much, addreſſing herſelf to the Barber. You muſt know, Mr <hi>Nicholas,</hi> quoth ſhe (for that was his name) that many times my Unkle wou'd read you thoſe unconſcionable Books of Diſventures for eight and forty hours together; then away he'd throw you his Book, and drawing his Sword, he'd fall a Fencing againſt the Walls, and when he had tir'd himſelf with cutting and ſlaſhing, he wou'd cry, he had kill'd Four Giants as big as any Steeples; and the ſweat which he put himſelf into, he wou'd ſay, was the Blood of the Wounds he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in the Fight; then wou'd he ſwallow you a huge Jug of cold water, and preſently he'd be as quiet, and as well as e're he was in his life; and he ſaid that this ſame water was a ſort of precious Drink brought him by the Sage<note n="*" place="bottom">Alquife.</note> 
                              <hi>Eſquife,</hi> a great Magician, and his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Friend. Now 'tis I who am the Cauſe of of all this Miſchief, for not giving you time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly notice of my Unkle's Raving, that you
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54446:35"/>
might have put a ſtop to it, e're 'twas too late, and have burnt all thoſe excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated Books; for there are I don't know how many of 'em that deſerve as much to be burn'd as thoſe of the rankeſt Hereticks. I am of your mind, ſaid the Curate, and verily to morrow ſhall not paſs over before I have fairly brought 'em to a Tryal, and condemn'd 'em to be burn'd, that they may not miniſter occaſion to ſuch as wou'd read 'em, to be perverted after the example of my good Friend. The Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who with <hi>Don Quixote</hi> ſtood without, liſtning to all this Diſcourſe, now perfectly underſtood by this the Cauſe of his Neighbor's diſorder, and therefore without any more ado, he call'd our aloud, Here! Houſe! O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the Gates there, for the Lord <hi>Baldwin,</hi> and the Lord Marquis of <hi>Mantua,</hi> who is coming ſadly wounded, and for the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Lord <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bindaraez,</hi> whom the valorous <hi>Don Rodrigo de Narvaez,</hi> Alcayde of <hi>Antequera,</hi> brings Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner. At which words they all got out of doors, and the one finding it to be her Unkle, and the other to be her Maſter, and the reſt their Friend, who had not yet alighted from the Aſs, becauſe indeed he was not able, they all ran to embrace him; to whom <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> Forbear ſaid he, for I am ſorely hurt, by reaſon that my Horſe failed me; carry me to Bed, and if it be poſſible let the Enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rganda</hi> be ſent for, to cure my wounds. Now in the name of miſchief, quoth the Houſe-keeper, ſee whether I did not gueſs right, on which Foot my Maſter halted? Come, get you to Bed, I beſeech you; and my life for yours, we'll take care to cure you
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54446:36"/>
without ſending for that ſame <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rganda.</hi> A hearty Curſe, and the Curſe of Curſes, I ſay it again and again a hundred times, light upon thoſe Books of Chivalry that have put you in this pickle. Thereupon they carry'd him up to his Bed, and ſearch'd for his wounds, but cou'd find none; and then he told them he was only bruis'd, having had a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fall from his Horſe <hi>Rozinante,</hi> while he was fighting ten Giants, the moſt outrageous and audacious that ever cou'd be found upon the face of the Earth. How, cry'd the Curate, have we Giants too in combination againſt us? Nay then, may I forfeit my Habit, if I don't burn 'em all by to morrow night. Then did they ask the <hi>Don</hi> a thouſand queſtions, but to every one he made no other anſwer, but that they ſhou'd give him ſomething to eat, and then leave him to his Repoſe, a thing which was to him of greater importance. They comply'd with his deſires, and then the Curate inform'd himſelf at large, in what condition the Country-man had found him, and having had a full account of every particular, as alſo of the Knight's extravagant talk, both when the Fellow found him, and as he brought him home, this encreas'd the Curate's deſire of effecting what he had reſolv'd to do the next morning. At which time he call'd upon his friend, Mr <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Barber, and went with him to <hi>Don Quixote</hi>'s houſe.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of the pleaſant and curious Survey which the Curate and the Barber took of the Library of our ingenious Gentleman.</head>
                           <p>THe Knight was yet aſleep, when the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate came attended by the Barber, and deſired his Niece to let him have the Key of the Room, where her Unkle kept his Books, the authors of his Woes; ſhe readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, and ſo in they went, and the Houſe-keeper with 'em. There they found above a hundred large Volumes neatly bound; and a good number of ſmall ones. As ſoon as the Houſekeeper had ſpy'd 'em out, ſhe ran out of the Study, and rerurn'd immediately with a Holy-water-pot and a Sprinkler, Here Doctor, cry'd ſhe, pray ſprinkle every Creek and Corner in the Room, leſt there ſhou'd lurk in it ſome one of the many Sorcerers theſe Books ſwarm with, who might chance to bewitch us, for the ill will we bear 'em, in going about to ſend 'em out of the World. The Curate cou'd not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear ſmiling at the old womans ſimplicity, and deſir'd the Barber to reach him the Books one by one, that he might peruſe the Title pages, for perhaps they might find ſome among 'em, that might not deſerve to be committed to the Flames. Oh, by no means cryed the Niece; ſpare none of em, they all helpt ſome how or other, to crack my Unkle's Brains. I fancy,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54446:37"/>
we had beſt throw 'em all out at the Window into the Yard, and lay 'em together in a heap, and then ſet 'em o'fire, or elſe carry 'em into the Back yard, and there make a pile of 'em, and burn 'em, and ſo the ſmoke will offend no body. The Houſekeeper join'd with her, ſo eagerly bent they were both upon the deſtruction of thoſe poor Innocents. But the Curate wou'd not condeſcend to theſe irregular Proceedings, and reſolv'd firſt to read at leaſt the Title Pages of every Book.</p>
                           <p>The firſt that Mr <hi>Nicholas</hi> put into his hands was <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> in four Volumes. There ſeems to be ſome myſtery in this Books being the firſt taken down (cry'd the Curate, as ſoon as he had lookt upon't) for I have heard 'tis the firſt Book of Knight-Errantry, that ever was print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Spain;</hi> and the model of all the reſt; and therefore I am of opinion, that, as the firſt Teacher and Author of ſo pernicious a Sect, it ought to be condemn'd to the Fire without mercy, I beg a reprieve for him, cry'd the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; for I have been told, 'tis the beſt Book that has been written in that kind; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the only good thing of that ſort, it may deſerve a Pardon. Well then, reply'd the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate for this time, let him have it. Let's ſee that other, which lyes next to him. Theſe, ſaid the Barber, are the exploits of <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully begotten Son of <hi>Amadis de Gaule.</hi> Verily, ſaid the Curate, the Fathers goodneſs, ſhall not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the want of it in the Son. Here, good Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs Houſe-keeper open that Window, and throw it into the Yard, and let it ſerve as a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to that Pile we are to ſet a blazing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently. She was not ſlack in her obedience, and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54446:37"/>
thus poor <hi>Don Eſplandian</hi> was ſent headlong into the Yard, there patiently to wait the time of his fiery Tryal. To the next, cry'd the Curate. This, ſaid the Barber, is <hi>Amadis</hi> of <hi>Greece;</hi> and I'm of opinion that all thoſe that ſtand on this ſide are of the ſame Family. Then let 'em all be ſent packing into the Yard, reply'd the Curate; for rather than loſe the pleaſure of burning Queen <hi>Antiquineſtra</hi> and the Shepherd <hi>Darinel</hi> with his Eclogues, and the confounded unintelligible diſcourſes of the Author, I think I ſhou'd burn my own Father along with 'em, if I met him in the diſguiſe of a Knight-Errant. I am of your mind, cry'd the Barber. And I too, ſaid the Niece. Nay then, quoth the old Female, let 'em come, and down with 'em all into the Yard. They were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to her accordingly, and many they were, ſo that to ſave herſelf the labour of carrying 'em down ſtairs, ſhe fairly ſent 'em flying out at Wjndow.</p>
                           <p>What overgrown piece of Lumber have we here? cry'd the Curate. <hi>Olivante de Laura,</hi> return'd the Barber. The ſame Author wrote <hi>The Garden of Flowers;</hi> and to deal ingenuouſly with you, I cannot well tell which of the two Books has moſt Truth in it; or, to ſpeak more properly, leſs Lyes: But this I know for certain, that he ſhall march into the Back-Yard, like a nonſenſical arrogant Blockhead as he is.</p>
                           <p>The next, cry'd the Barber, is <hi>Floriſmart of Hircania.</hi> How! my Lord <hi>Floriſmart,</hi> is he here, reply'd the Curate? Nay, then truly he ſhall e'en follow the reſt to the Yard, in ſpight of his wonderful Birth and incredible Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; for his rough, dull and inſipid ſtile de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54446:38"/>
no better uſage. Come, toſs him into the Yard, and this other too, good Miſtreſs! With all my heart, quoth the Governeſs, and ſtrait ſhe was as good as her word.</p>
                           <p>Here's the noble <hi>Don Platir,</hi> cry'd the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. 'Tis an old Book, reply'd the Curate; and I can think of nothing in him that deſerves a grain of pity: Away with him, without any more words; and down he went accordingly.</p>
                           <p>Another Book was open'd, and it prov'd to be <hi>The Knight of the Croſs.</hi> The holy Title, cry'd the Curate, might in ſome meaſure attone for the badneſs of the Book; but then, as the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, <hi>The Devil lurks behind the Croſs!</hi> To the Flames with him.</p>
                           <p>Then the Barber taking down another Book, cry'd here's the <hi>Mirrour of Knighthood.</hi> Oh I have the honour to know him, reply'd the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. There you ſhall find the Lord <hi>Rinaldo of Montaban,</hi> with his Friends and Companions, all of 'em greater Thieves than <hi>Cacus,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the twelve Peers of <hi>France,</hi> and that faithful Hiſtorian <hi>Turpin.</hi> Truly, I muſt needs ſay, I am only for condemning 'em to perpetual Baniſhment, at leaſt becauſe their ſtory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ſomething of the famous <hi>Boyardo</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention; out of which the Chriſtian Poet <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſto</hi> alſo borrow'd his ſubject; yet, if I happen to meet with him in this bad Company, and ſpeaking in any other Language than his own, I ll ſhow him no manner of favour; but if he talks in his own Native Tongue, I ll treat him with all the reſpect imaginable. I have him at home in <hi>Italian,</hi> ſaid the Barber, but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not underſtand him. 'Tis not convenient you ſhou'd, reply d the Curate; and I cou'd wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54446:38"/>
have excus'd the good Captain who tranſlated it, that trouble of attempting to make him ſpeak <hi>Spaniſh;</hi> for he has depriv'd him of a great deal of his primitive Graces; a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune incident to all thoſe who preſume to tranſlate Verſes; ſince their utmoſt wit and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry can never enable 'em, to preſerve the native Beauties and Genius that ſhine in the original. For this reaſon, I am for having not only this Book, but likewiſe all thoſe, which we ſhall find here treating of <hi>French</hi> affairs, thrown and depoſited in ſome dry Vault, till we have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely determin'd what ought to be done with 'em; give me leave to except one <hi>Bernardo del Carpio,</hi> that muſt be ſomewhere here among the reſt, and another call'd <hi>Ronceſvalles;</hi> for whenever I meet with 'em, I will certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver 'em up into the hands of the Secular pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. The Barber gave his approbation to every particular, well knowing that the Curate was ſo good a Chriſtian, and ſo great a lover of truth, that he would not have uttered a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity for all the world. Then opening another Volume, he found it to be <hi>Palmerin de Oliva,</hi> and the next to that, <hi>Palmerin of England.</hi> Ha! Have I found you, cry'd the Curate! Here, take that <hi>Oliva,</hi> let him be torn to pieces, then burnt, and his aſhes ſcatter'd in the Air. But let <hi>Palmerin of England</hi> be preſerv'd, as a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Relique of Antiquity; and let ſuch a coſtly box be made for him, as <hi>Alexander</hi> found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Spoils of <hi>Darius,</hi> which he devoted to encloſe <hi>Homer</hi> s Works. For I muſt tell you, Neighbor, that Book deſerves particular reſpect for two things. Firſt for its own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies; and Secondly, for the ſake of its
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54446:39"/>
Author, who is ſaid to have been a learned King of <hi>Portugal.</hi> Then, all the Adventures of the Caſtle of <hi>Miraguarda</hi> are well, and art fully manag'd. The Dialogue very courtly and clear, and the Decorum ſtrictly obſerv'd in every Character, with equal Propriety and Judgment. Therefore, Mr <hi>Nicholas,</hi> continu'd he, with ſubmiſſion to your better advice, this and <hi>Amadis de Gaul</hi> ſhall be exempted from the Fire; and let all the reſt be condemn'd without any further enquiry or examination. By no means, I beſeech you, return'd the Barber; for this which I have in my hands is the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Don Bellianis.</hi> Truly, cry'd the Curate, he with his ſecond, third, and fourth parts, had need of a Doſe of Rhuharb to purge his exceſſive Choler: beſides, his Caſtle of Fame ſhou'd be demoliſh'd, and a heap of other Rubbiſh remov'd: In order to which I give my Vote to grant 'em the benefit of Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation; and as they ſhew ſigns of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo ſhall Mercy or Juſtice be us'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards 'em: In the mean time, Neighbor, take 'em into cuſtody, and keep 'em ſafe at home, but let none be permitted to converſe with 'em. Content, cry'd the Barber; and to ſave himſelf the labour of looking on any more Books of that kind, he bid the Houſe-keeper take all the great Volumes and throw 'em into the Yard. She, who long'd to be at that Sport, as much as to be making her Wedding Smock, had no need of being twice ſpoken to; ſo that laying hold on no leſs than eight Volumes at once, ſhe preſently made 'em leap towards the place of Execution.

conveniently carry, ſhe happen'd to drop one at the Barbers Feet, which he took up out of Curioſity, to ſee what it was, and found it to be the Hiſtory of the famous Knight <hi>Tirante the White;</hi> good lack-a-day, cry'd the Curate! Is <hi>Tirante the White</hi> here? Oh pray, good Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, give it me by all means, for I promiſe my ſelf to find in it a Treaſure of Delight, and a Mine of Recreation. There we have that valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Knight <hi>Don Kyrie-Eleiſo</hi> of <hi>Montaban,</hi> with his Brother <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Montaban,</hi> and the Knight <hi>Fonſeca;</hi> the combat of the valorous <hi>Detriante</hi> with the <hi>Maſtiff;</hi> the dainty and witty conceits of the Damſel <hi>Plazerdemivida,</hi> with the Loves and Guiles of the Widow <hi>Repoſada;</hi> together with the Lady Empreſs, that was in Love with <hi>Hippolito</hi> her Gentleman Uſher. I vow and proteſt to you, neighbour, continued he, that as for ſtyle there is not a better Book in the World. Why, here your Knights eat and drink, ſleep and dye natural Deaths in their Beds, nay, and firſt make their laſt Wills and Teſtaments; with a World of other things, of which all the reſt of theſe ſort of Books don't ſay one ſyllable. Yet after all, I muſt tell you, that for wilfully taking the pains to write ſo many fooliſh things, the worthy Author fairly deſerves to be ſent to the Galleys for all the days of his life. Take it home with you and read it, and then tell me whether I have told the truth or no. I believe you, reply'd the Barber: But what ſhall we do with all theſe ſmaller Books that are left? Certainly, return'd the Curate, theſe cannot be Books of Knight Errantry; they are too ſmall: You'll find they are only Poets. And ſo opening one, it happen'd to be the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na

of Montemayor,</hi> which made him ſay (believing all the reſt to be of that ſtamp) Theſe do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be puniſht like the others; for they neither have done, nor can do that miſchief which thoſe Stories of Chivalry have done; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generally ingenious Books, that can do no body any prejudice. Oh! good Sir, cry'd the Neice, burn 'em with the reſt, I beſeech you; for ſhou'd my Unkle get cur'd of his Knight-Errant-Frenzy, and betake himſelf to the reading of theſe Books, we ſhou'd have him turn Shepherd, and ſo wander thro the Woods and Fields, nay, and what wou'd be worſe yet, turn Poet, which they ſay is a catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and an incurable Diſeaſe. The Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is in the right, ſaid the Curate, and it will not be amiſs to remove that ſtumbling Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out of our Friends way; and ſince we began with the <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>Montemayor,</hi> I am of opinion, we ought not to burn it, but only take out that part of it, which treats of the Magician <hi>Felicia,</hi> and the enchanted water; as alſo all the longer Poems; and let the work eſcape with its Proſe, and the honour of being the chief of that kind. Here's another <hi>Diana,</hi> quoth the Barber, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of that name, by <hi>Salmantino,</hi> nay, and a third too, by <hi>Gil Polo.</hi> Pray, ſaid the Curate, let <hi>Salmantino</hi> encreaſe the number of the Cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Here's a Book of Songs by <hi>Lopez Maldonado,</hi> cry'd the Barber, he's alſo my particular Friend ſaid the Curate, his Verſes are very well lik d when he reads em himſelf, and his voice is ſo excellent, that they charm us whenever he ſings 'em. He ſeems indeed to be ſomewhat too long in his Eclogues; but can we ever have too much of a good Thing? let him be preſerv'd among the beſt. What's the next Book? The

                              <hi>Galatea of Miguel de Cervantes,</hi> reply'd the Barber. That <hi>Cervantes</hi> has been my intimate acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance theſe many years, cry'd the Curate, and I know he has been more converſant with misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes than with Poetry: His Book indeed has I don't know what that looks like a good deſign; he aims at ſomething, but concludes nothing: Therefore we muſt ſtay for the Second Part, which he has promis'd us; perhaps he may make us amends, and obtain a full Pardon, which is now deny'd him for the preſent; till that time keep him cloſe Priſoner at your houſe. I will, quoth the Barber: but ſee, I have here three more for you, <hi>The Auricana of Don Alonſo de Ercilla, The Auſtriada of Juan Ruffo,</hi> a Magiſtrate of <hi>Cordona,</hi> and the <hi>Monſerra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> of <hi>Chriſtopher de Virves,</hi> a <hi>Valentian</hi> Poet.

                           <p>At laſt, the Curate grew ſo tir'd with prying into ſo many Volumes, that he order'd all the reſt to be burnt at a venture. But the Barber ſhew'd him one which he had open'd by chance ere the dreadful Sentence was paſt. Truly, ſaid the Curate, who ſaw by the Title 'twas <hi>The Tears of Angelica,</hi> I ſhou'd have wept my ſelf had I caus'd ſuch a Book to ſhare the Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the reſt; for the Author was not only one of the beſt Poets in <hi>Spain,</hi> but in the whole World; and tranſlated ſome of <hi>Ovid</hi>'s Fables with extraordinary ſucceſs.</p>

                           <p>WHile they were thus employ'd, <hi>Don Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote</hi> in a raving fit began to talk aloud to himſelf. Here, here, valorous Knights, cry'd he, now's the time that you muſt exert the ſtrength of your mighty Arms; for, lo! the Courtiers bear away the honour of the Tourna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This amazing Outcry call'd away the Inquiſitors from any further Examination of the Library, and therefore the Houſe-keeper and the Neice being leſt to their own diſcretion, 'tis thought <hi>The Carolea,</hi> and <hi>Leo of Spain,</hi> with the <hi>Deeds of the Emperour,</hi> written by <hi>Don Lewis D' Avila,</hi> which to be ſure were part of the Collection, were committed to the flames un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen and unheard, without any legal Tryal. A Fate which they perhaps might have eſcap'd, had the Curate been there to have weigh'd what might have been urg'd in their defence.</p>
                           <p>When they came into <hi>Don Quixote</hi>'s Chamber, they found him riſen out of his Bed, as mad as ever he was, tearing his throat and making a heavy buſtle, laying about him with his Sword back-ſtroke and fore-ſtroke, as broad awake as if he had never ſlept. They ran in upon him, caught him in their arms, and carried him to bed again by main force; where, after he was ſomewhat quiet and ſettled, turning himſelf
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54446:42"/>
to the Curate, Certainly, cry'd he, my Lord Archbiſhop <hi>Turpin,</hi> 'tis a great diſhonour to us who are call'd the twelve Peers, to ſuffer the Knights of the Court to bear away the honour of the Tournament without any further oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, after we the Knights Adventurers had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it for three days before. Be pacify'd, my good Friend, reply'd the Curate; Fortune may have yet better ſucceſs in reſerve for you, and they who loſe to day may win to morrow; at preſent, think on your health, for doubtleſs you muſt needs be now extremely tir'd, if not very much wounded. Wounded, reply'd <hi>Don Quixote!</hi> No, but as for being bruis'd, I will not deny it; for that baſe-born Knight, <hi>Don Orlando,</hi> has batter'd all my Limbs with the Trunk of an Oak, out of meer Envy, becauſe he ſees that I alone dare rival his Exploits. But may I no more be call'd <hi>Rinaldo of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talban,</hi> if, in ſpight of all his Enchantments, I do not make him ſeverely pay for this, as ſoon as I can leave my Bed; and therefore let my Dinner be brought in, for 'tis what I want moſt at this juncture, and then let me alone to revenge this abuſe. Accordingly they brought him ſome Victuals, which when he had eaten, he fell aſleep again, and they left him, all of 'em ſtrangely amaz'd at his uncommon mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. That Night the Houſe-keeper burnt all the Books, not only thoſe in the Yard, but all thoſe that were in the Houſe; and ſeveral ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd in the general calamity, that deſerv'd to have been treaſur'd up in everlaſting Archives, had not their fate, and the remiſsneſs of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor prevented it. And thus they made good the Proverb, That <hi>the good often fare the worſe for the bad.</hi>

                              </gap>d about it, they ſhould tell him, that a certain Enchanter had carry'd away Study Books and all. Two days after, <hi>Don Quixote</hi> being got up, the firſt thing he did was to go viſit his darling Books, and as he cou'd not find the Study, in the place where he had left it, he went up and down and lookt for it in every Room. Sometimes he came to the place where the door us'd to ſtand; and then ſtood feeling and groping about a good while, then caſt his Eyes and ſtar'd on every ſide, without ſpeaking a word. At laſt, after a long deliberation, he thought fit to ask his Houſe-keeper, which was the way to his Study? What Study, (anſwer'd the Woman, according to her inſtructions) or rather what nothing is it you look for? Alas, here's neither Study nor Books in the Houſe now; for the Devil is run away with 'em all. No, 'twas not the Devil, ſaid the Niece, but a Conjurer or an Enchanter, as they call 'em, who, ſince you went, came hither one night mounted on a Dragon, o'top of a Cloud, and then, alighting, went into your Study, where, what he did, he and the Devil beſt can tell, for he went out a while after; and flew out at the Roof of the Houſe, leaving it all in a ſmoak; and when we went to ſee what he had done, we cou'd neither find the Books, nor ſo much as the very Study
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54446:43"/>
Only the Houſe-keeper and I very well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that as the wicked old man was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away, he cry'd out aloud, that out of a private grudge, which he bore in his mind to the Owner of thoſe Books, he had done the Houſe a miſchief, as we ſhou'd ſoon perceive. And then I think he call'd himſelf the Sage <hi>Muniaton.</hi> Not <hi>Muniaton,</hi> but <hi>Freſton,</hi> you ſhou'd have ſaid, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote.</hi> Truly, quoth the Niece, I can't tell whether 'twas <hi>Freſton</hi> or <hi>Friſton;</hi> but ſure I am his name end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a <hi>Ton.</hi> 'Tis ſo, return'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> for he is a famous Negromancer and my mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Enemy; and bears me a great deal of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, foreſeeing by his Art, that in ſpight of all his Spells, in proceſs of time I ſhall fight and vanquiſh in ſingle Combat, a Knight whoſe Intereſt he eſpouſes; therefore he endeavours to do me all manner of miſchief. But I dare aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him, that he drives againſt the ſtream, nor can his power reverſe the firſt decrees of Fate. Who doubts of that, cry'd the Niece? But, dear Unkle, what makes you run your ſelf into theſe quarrels? Had not you better ſtay at home and live in piece and quietneſs, than go rambling up and down like a Vagabond, and ſeeking for better Bread than is made of Wheat; without once ſo much as conſidering that many go to ſeek Wooll, and come home ſhorn themſelves? Oh! good Niece, reply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> how ill thou underſtand'ſt theſe matters? Know that before I'll ſuffer my ſelf to be ſhorn, I'll tear and pluck off the beards of all thoſe audacious Mortals, that ſhall but attempt to prophane the tip of one ſingle hair within the Verge of theſe Muſtachio's. To
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54446:43"/>
this neither the Niece nor the Governeſs thought fit to make any reply, for they perceiv'd the Knight began to grow angry. Full fifteen days did our Knight remain quietly at home, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out betraying the leaſt ſign of his deſire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new his Rambling, during which time there paſt a great deal of pleaſant diſcourſe between him and his two Cronies, the Curate and the Barber; while he maintain'd that there was nothing of which the world ſtood in ſo much need as Knights-Errant, wherefore he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to revive the Order. In which diſputes Mr Curate ſometimes contradicted him, and ſometimes ſubmitted; for had he not now and then given way to his fancies, there wou'd have been no converſing with him.</p>
                           <p>In the mean time, <hi>Don Quixote</hi> earneſtly ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited one of his Neighbours, a Husbandman, and a good honeſt Fellow, if we may call a poor man honeſt, for he was poor indeed; poor in Purſe, and poor in Brains; and in ſhort the Knight talk'd ſo long to him, ply'd him with ſo many Arguments, and made him ſo many fair promiſes, that at laſt the poor ſilly Clown con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to go along with him, and become his Squire. Among other inducements to intice him to do it willingly, <hi>Don Quixote</hi> forgot not to tell him, that 'twas likely ſuch an Adventure wou'd preſent it ſelf, as might ſecure him the Conqueſt of ſome Iſland, in the time that he might be picking up a Straw or two; and then the Squire might promiſe himſelf to be made Governor of the place.

He alſo borrow'd a Target of a friend, and having patch'd up his Head-piece and Beaver, as well as he cou'd, he gave his Squire notice of the day and hour when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſet out, that he might alſo furniſh himſelf with what he thought neceſſary; but above all he charg'd him to provide himſelf with a Wallet; which <hi>Sancho</hi> promis'd to do, telling him, he wou'd alſo take his Aſs along with him, which being a very good one, might be a great eaſe to him, for he was not us'd to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel much a foot. The mentioning of the Aſs, made the noble Knight pauſe a while, he mus'd and ponder'd, whether he had ever read of any Knight-Errant, whoſe Squire us'd to ride upon an Aſs; but he cou'd not remember any prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for it. However, he gave him leave at laſt to bring his Aſs, hoping to mount him more honourably with the firſt opportunity, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſing the next Diſcourteous Knight he ſhou'd meet. He alſo furniſh'd himſelf with Shirts, and as many other neceſſaries as he cou'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently carry, according to the Inn-keepers injunctions. Which being done, <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> without bidding either his Wife or Children good-b'y, and <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> without taking any more notice of his Houſe-keeper or of his Niece, ſtole out of the Village one night, not ſo much as ſuſpected by any body, and made ſuch haſte, that by break of day they thought themſelves out of reach, ſhou'd they happen to be purſu'd. As for <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> he rode like a Patriarch,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54446:44"/>
with his Canvas Knapſack or Wallet, and his Leathern Bottle, having a huge deſire to ſee himſelf Governour of the Iſland which his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter had promis'd him.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Don Quixote</hi> happen'd to ſtrike into the ſame Road which he took the time before, that is, the Plains of <hi>Montiel,</hi> over which he travell'd with leſs Inconveniency than when he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, by reaſon it was yet early in the morning; at which time the Sun-beams being almoſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to the ſurface of the Earth, and not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly darted down, as in the middle of the day, did not prove ſo offenſive. As they jogg'd on, I beſeech your Worſhip, Sir Knight-Errant, quoth <hi>Sancho</hi> to his Maſter, be ſure you don't forget what you promis'd me about the Iſland! for I dare ſay I ſhall make ſhift to govern it, let it be never ſo big. You muſt know, Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> reply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> that it has been the conſtant practice of Knights-Errant in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages to make their Squires Governours of the Iſlands or Kingdoms they conquer'd; now I am not only reſolv'd to keep up that laudable Cuſtom, but even to improve it, and outdo my Predeceſſors in Generoſity; for whereas ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, or rather moſt commonly, other Knights delay'd rewarding their Squires till they were grown old, and worn out with ſervice, bad days, worſe nights, and all manner of hard duty, and then put 'em off with ſome Title, either of Count, or at leaſt Marquis of ſome Valley, or Province, of great or ſmall extent: Now, if thou and I do but live, it may happen that before we have paſt ſix days together, I may conquer ſome Kingdom, having many other Kingdoms an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>next to its Imperial Crown; and this wou'd fall
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54446:45"/>
out moſt luckily for thee, for then wou'd I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently crown thee King of one of 'em. Nor do thou imagine this to be a mighty matter; for ſo ſtrange accidents, and revolutions ſo ſudden and ſo unforeſeen, attend the Profeſſion of Chivalry, that I might eaſily give thee a great deal more than I have promis'd. Why, ſhou'd this come to paſs, quoth <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> and I be made a King, by ſome ſuch like Miracle as your Worſhip ſays, then happy be lucky, wou'd our <hi>Joane Gutierez</hi> be at leaſt a Queen, and my Children Infanta's and Princes, an't like your Worſhip? Who doubts of that, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote?</hi> I doubt of it, reply'd <hi>Sancho Panca;</hi> for I can't help believing, that tho it ſhould rain Kingdoms down upon the face of the Earth, not one of 'em wou'd ſit well upon <hi>Joane Gutierez</hi>'s Head: For I muſt needs tell you, ſhe's not worth two braſs Jacks to make a Queen of: No, Counteſs wou'd be better for her, an't pleaſe you; and that too, God help her, will be as much as ſhe can handſomly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage.

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the Loſs of his Lance, was no ſmall affliction to him, and as he was making his complaint about it to his Squire, I have read, ſaid he, friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> that a certain <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Knight, whoſe name was <hi>Diego Perez de Vargas,</hi> having broken his Sword in the heat of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, tore down a huge maſſy Branch of an Oak, and did ſuch wonderful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, cruſhing and grinding ſo many <hi>Moors</hi> with it that day, that he won himſelf and his Poſteriy the Surname of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54446:48"/>
                              <note n="*" place="bottom">Machuca.</note> The Grinder. I tell thee this, becauſe I intend to tear down from the next Oak we meet, a branch as good as that at leaſt, with which I hope to perform ſuch wondrous Deeds, that thou wilt eſteem thy ſelf parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly happy in having had the honor to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold 'em, and been the ocular witneſs of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements, which Poſterity will ſcarce be able to believe. Heaven grant you may, cry'd <hi>Sancho;</hi> I believe it all, becauſe your Worſhip ſays it. But an't pleaſe you, ſit a little more upright in your Saddle; you ride ſideling methinks; but that, I ſuppoſe, proceeds from your being bruis'd by the fall. It does ſo, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd <hi>Don Quixote;</hi> and if I do not complain of the pain, 'tis becauſe a Knight-Errant muſt never complain of his Wounds, though his Bowels were dropping out thro 'em. Then I've no more to ſay, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> and yet Heaven knows my heart, I ſhou'd be glad to hear your Worſhip hone a little now and then, when ſomething ails you. <hi>Don Quixote</hi> cou'd not forbear ſmiling at the ſimplicity of his Squire, and told him, he gave him leave to complain not only when he pleas'd, but as much as he pleas'd, whether he had any cauſe or no; for he had never yet read any thing to the contrary in any Books of Chivalry. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> deſired him however to remember 'twas high time to go to Dinner; but his Maſter an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd him, that he might eat when e're he pleas'd, as for himſelf he was not yet diſpos'd to do it. <hi>Sancho</hi> having thus obtain'd leave,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54446:48"/>
fix'd himſelf as orderly as he cou'd upon his Aſs, and taking ſome Victuals out of his Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, fell to munching luſtily as he rode behind his Maſter, and ever and anon he lifted his Bottle to his Noſe, and fetch'd ſuch hearty pulls, that 'twou d have made the beſt pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd Vintner in <hi>Malaga</hi> adry to have ſeen him. While he thus went on ſtuffing and ſwilling, he did not think in the leaſt of all his Maſters great promiſes; and was ſo far from eſteeming it a trouble, to travel in queſt of Adventures, that he fancied it to be the greateſt pleaſure in the world, tho they were never ſo dreadful.</p>
                           <p>In fine, they paſt that Night under ſome Trees; from one of which <hi>Don Quixote</hi> tore a wither'd Branch, which in ſome ſort was able to ſerve him for a Lance, and to this he fixt the Lead or Spear of his broken Lance. But he did not ſleep all that night, keeping his Thoughts intent on his dear <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of what he had read in Books of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry, where the Knights paſs that time without ſleep, in Foreſts and Deſarts, wholly taken up with the entertaining thoughts of their abſent Miſtreſſes. As for <hi>Sancho,</hi> he did not ſpend the Night at that idle rate, for having his Paunch well ſtuff'd with ſomething more than Wind, he made but one nap of it, and had not his Maſter wak'd him, neither the ſprightly beams which the Sun darted on his face, nor the melody of the Birds that chearfully on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry branch welcom'd the ſmiling morn, wou'd have been able to have made him ſtir. As he got up, to clear his eye-ſight, he took two or three long-winded ſwiggs at his friendly Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54446:49"/>
for a Mornings Draught: But he found it ſomewhat lighter than it was the night before; which misfortune went to his very heart; for he ſhrewdly miſtruſted that he was not in a way to cure it of that diſtemper as ſoon as he cou'd have wiſh'd. On the other ſide, <hi>Don Quixote</hi> wou'd not break faſt, having been feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all night on the more delicate and ſavoury thoughts of his Miſtreſs; and therefore they went on directly towards the Paſs of <hi>Lapice,</hi> which they diſcover'd about three a clock. When they came near it, Here it is, Brother <hi>Sancho,</hi> cry'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> that we may wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and as it were thruſt our Arms up to the very Elbows in that which we call Adventures.

But if thoſe with whom I am fighting are Knights, thou muſt not do it, for the Laws of Chivalry do not allow thee to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter a Knight, till thou art one thy ſelf. Never fear, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> I'll be ſure to obey your Worſhip in that, Ill warrant you; for I've ever lov'd peace and quietneſs, and never car'd to thruſt my ſelf into Frays and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels; and yet I don't care to take blows at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ones hands neither, and ſhou'd any Knight offer to ſet upon me firſt, I fancy I ſhould hardly mind your Laws; for all Laws, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God or Man, allows one to ſtand on his own defence, if any offer to do him a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. I agree to that, reply'd <hi>Don Quixote;</hi>
                              <pb n="69" facs="tcp:54446:49"/>
but as for helping me againſt any Knights, thou muſt ſet bounds to thy natural impulſes. I'll be ſure to do it, quoth <hi>Sancho.</hi> Ne're truſt me if I don't keep your Commandment as well as I do the Sabbath.</p>
                           <p>As they were talking, they ſpy'd coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards 'em two Monks of the order of St <hi>Bennet,</hi> mounted on two Dromedaries, for the Mules on which they rode were ſo high and ſtately, that they ſeem'd little leſs. They wore Riding-Masks with Glaſſes at the Eyes, againſt the Duſt, and Umbrella's to ſhelter 'em from the Sun. After 'em came a Coach with four or five Men on Horſeback, and two Muleteers afoot. There prov'd to be in the Coach a <hi>Biſcayan</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, who was going to <hi>Sevill</hi> to meet her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band that was there, in order to embark for the <hi>Indies,</hi> to take poſſeſſion of a conſiderable Poſt. Scarce had <hi>Don Quixote</hi> perceiv'd the Monks, who were not of the ſame company, tho they went the ſame way, but he cry'd to his Squire, Either I am deceiv'd, or this will prove the moſt famous Adventure that ever was known; for without all queſtion, thoſe two black things that move towards us muſt be ſome Negro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancers, that are carrying away by force ſome Princeſs in that Coach; and tis my Duty to prevent ſo great an Injury. I fear me, this will prove a worſe job than the Wind-mills, quoth <hi>Sancho.</hi> Slife, Sir, don't you ſee theſe are <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictin</hi> Fryars, and 'tis likely the Coach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to ſome Travellers that are in't. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore once more take warning, and don't you be led away by the Devil. I have already told thee, <hi>Sancho,</hi> reply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> thou art miſerably ignorant in matters of Adventures.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54446:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
What I ſay is true, and thou ſhalt find it ſo preſently. This ſaid, he ſpurr'd on his Horſe, and poſted himſelf juſt in the midſt of the Road, where the Monks were to paſs. And when they came within hearing, Curſt Implements of Hell, cry'd he, in a loud and haughty tone, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately releaſe thoſe high-born Princeſſes, whom you are violently conveying away in that Coach, or elſe prepare to meet with inſtant Death, as the juſt Puniſhment of your pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deeds. The Monks ſtopt their Mules, no leſs aſtoniſh'd at the Figure than at the Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Speaker. Sir Knight, cry'd they, we are no ſuch perſons as you are pleas'd to term us, but Religious men, of the Order of St <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedict,</hi> that travel about our affairs, and are wholly ignorant whether or no there are any Princeſſes carried away by force in that Coach. I'm not to be deceiv'd with fair words, reply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> I know you well enough, perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Caitiffs: and immediately, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting their reply, he ſet Spurs to <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and ran ſo furiouſly with his Lance couch'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the firſt Monk, that if he had not prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flung himſelf off to the ground, the Knight wou'd certainly have laid him either dead or grievouſly wounded. The other, obſerving the diſcourteous uſage of his Companion, clapt his heels to his over-grown Mule's Flanks, and ſcowr'd o're the Plain, as if he had been run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a race with the Wind. <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> no ſooner ſaw the Monk fall, but he nimbly skipt off his Aſs, and running to him, began to ſtrip him immediately: But then the two M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the mean while, the Monk, ſcar d out of his wits, and as pale as a Ghoſt, got upon his Mule again as faſt as he cou'd, and ſpurr'd after his friend, who ſtaid for him at a diſtance, expecting the iſſue of this ſtrange Adventure; but being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſtay to ſee the end of it, they made the beſt of their way, making more ſigns of the Croſs than if the Devil had been poſting after 'em.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> as I ſaid, was all that while engag d with the Ladies in the Coach; Lady, cry'd he, your Diſcretion is now at liberty to diſpoſe of your beautiful ſelf as you pleaſe; for the preſumptuous arrogance of thoſe who attempted to enſlave your perſon lies proſtrate in the duſt, overthrown by this my ſtrenuous Arm; and that you may not be at a loſs for the name of your Deliverer, Know, I am call'd <hi>Don Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> by Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Knight-Errant, and Adventurer, Captive to that peerleſs Beauty, <hi>Donna Dulcinea del Toboſo.</hi> Nor do I deſire any other recompence for the ſervice I have done you, but that you
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54446:51"/>
return to <hi>Toboſo</hi> to preſent your ſelves to that Lady, and let her know what I have done to purchaſe your deliverance. To this extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant talk, a certain <hi>Biſcayan Squire,</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Uſher, or what you'll pleaſe to call him, who rode along with the Coach, liſten'd with great attention, and perceiving that <hi>Don Quixote</hi> not only ſtopt the Coach, but wou'd have it preſently go back to <hi>Toboſo,</hi> he bore briskly up to him, and laying hold on his Lance, <hi>Get gone,</hi> (cry'd he to him in bad <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and worſe <hi>Biſcayan) Get gone, thou Knight, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil go with thou, or by the he who me create, if thou no leave the Coach, me kill thee now ſo ſure as me be</hi> Biſcayan. <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> who made ſhift to underſtand him well enough, very calmly made him this anſwer. Wer't thou a Knight or Gentleman,<note n="*" place="bottom">

What, me no Gentleman, reply'd the <hi>Biſcayan?</hi> I ſwear thou be Lyar, as me be Chriſtian. If thou throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Lance, and draw Sword, me will make no more of thee than Cat does of Mouſe.

I'll try Titles with you, as the man ſaid, reply'd <hi>Don Quixote;</hi> and with that throwing away his Lance, he drew his Sword, graſp'd his Target, and attack'd the <hi>Biſcay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>

fully bent on his Deſtruction. The <hi>Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayan</hi> ſeeing him come on ſo furiouſly, wou d gladly have alighted, not truſting to his Mule, which was one of thoſe ſcurvy Jades that are let out to hire; but all he had time to do, was only to draw his Sword, and ſnatch a Cuſhion out of the Coach, to ſerve him inſtead of a Shield; and immediately they aſſaulted one another with all the Fury of Mortal Enemies. The by-ſtanders did all they cou'd to prevent their fighting; but 'twas in vain; for the <hi>Biſcayan</hi> ſwore in his gibberiſh he wou'd kill his very Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, and all thoſe who preſum'd to hinder him, if they wou'd not let him fight. The Lady in the Coach, being extremely affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at theſe Paſſages, made her Coachman drive out of harms way, and at a diſtance, was an Eye-witneſs of the furious Combat. At the ſame time, the <hi>Biſcayan</hi> let fall ſuch a mighty blow on <hi>Don Quixote</hi> s ſhoulder over his Target, that had not his Armour been Sword proof, he wou'd have cleft him down to the very Waſte. The Knight feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the weight of that unmeaſurable Blow, cry'd out aloud, Oh, Lady of my Soul, <hi>Dulcinea!</hi> flower of all Beauty, vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to ſuccour your Champion in this dangerous Combat, undertaken to ſet forth your worth. The breathing out of this ſhort Prayer, the griping faſt of his Sword, the covering of himſelf with his Shield, and the Charging of his Enemy, was but the work of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for <hi>Don Quixote</hi> was reſolv d to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54446:52"/>
venture the Fortune of the Combat all upon one blow. The <hi>Biſcayan,</hi> who read his Deſign in his dreadful Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, reſolv'd to face him with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual ravery, and ſtand the terrible ſhock, cover'd with the Cuſhion, not being able to manage his Jaded Mule, who, defying the Spur, and all other provocations, wou'd move neither to the Right nor to the Left. While <hi>Don Quixote</hi> thus with his Sword aloft was ruſhing upon the wary <hi>Biſcayan</hi> with a full reſolution to cleave him aſunder; all the Spectators ſtood trembling with Terrour and Amazement, expecting the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful event of thoſe prodigious blows which threaten'd the two deſperate Combatants: The Lady in the Coach with her Women were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a thouſand Vows and Offerings to all the places of Devotion in <hi>Spain,</hi> that Providence might deliver them and the Squire out of the great danger that threaten'd 'em.</p>
                           <p>But here we muſt deplore the abrupt end of this Hiſtory, which the Author leaves off juſt at the very point when the Fortune of the Battel is going to be decided, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he cou'd find nothing more record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of <hi>Don Quixote</hi> s wondrous Atchievements than what he had already related.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:54446:54"/>
terrible blows, which had they fall'n directly, and met with no oppoſition, wou'd have cut and divided the two Combatans from Head to Heel, and have ſplit 'em like a Pomgranate. But as I ſaid before, the ſtory remain'd imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, neither did the Author inform us, where we might find the remaining Part of the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This vext me extremely, and turn'd the pleaſure, which the peruſal of the beginning had afforded me, into diſguſt, when I had reaſon to deſpair of ever ſeeing the reſt. Yet, after all, it ſeem'd to me no leſs impoſſible, than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, that ſo valiant a Knight ſhou'd have been deſtitute of ſome learned Perſon, to record his incomparable Exploits; a misfortune which never attended any of his Predeceſſors, I mean the Knights Adventurers, each of whom was always provided with one or two learned Men, who were always at hand, to write, not only their wondrous Deeds; but alſo to ſet down their trivial Thoughts, were they never ſo hidden. Therefore, as I cou'd not imagin, that ſo worthy a Knight ſhou'd be ſo unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, as to want that, which has been ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſely laviſh'd, even on ſuch a one as <hi>Platyr,</hi> and others of that ſtamp, I cou'd not induce my ſelf to believe, that ſo admirable a Hiſtory was ever left unfiniſh'd: And rather choſe to think that Time, the devourer of all things, had either hid or conſum'd it. On the other ſide, when I conſider'd that ſeveral Modern Books were found in his Study, as <hi>The Cure of Jealouſy,</hi> and <hi>The Nymphs and Shepherds of Hena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> I had reaſon to think, that the Hiſtory of our Knight cou'd be of no very antient date, and that, had it never been continu'd, yet his
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:54446:54"/>
Neighbours and Friends, cou'd not have forgot the moſt remarkable paſſages of his Life, Full of this imagination, I reſolv'd to make it my buſineſs to make a particular and exact in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry; into the Life and Miracles of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown'd <hi>Spaniard, Don Quixote,</hi> that refulgent Glory and Mirror, of the Knighthood of <hi>la Mancha,</hi> and the firſt, who in theſe deprav'd and miſerable times, devoted himſelf to the neglected profeſſion of Knight-Errantry, to redreſs Wrongs and Injuries, to relieve Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and defend the honour of Damſels; ſuch of 'em, I mean, who in former Ages, rode up and down with Whip in hand, mounted on their Palfreys, with all their Virginity about 'em, ſecure from all manner of danger, and who, unleſs they happen'd to be raviſh'd by ſome boiſterous Villain, or huge Giant, were ſure, at fourſcore years of Age, (all which Time, they never Slept one Night under a Roof) to be decently laid in their graves, as pure Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins as their very Mothers. For this reaſon and many others, I ſay, our gallant <hi>Don Quixote</hi> is worthy everlaſting and univerſal praiſe; nor ought I to be deny'd my due commendation for my indefatigable care and diligence in ſeeking and finding out the continuation of this delightful Hiſtory; tho after all I muſt confeſs, that had not Providence, Chance, or Fortune, as I will now inform you, aſſiſted me in the diſcovery, the World had been depriv'd of two hours diverſion and pleaſure, which 'tis likely to afford to thoſe, who will read it with attention.</p>
                           <p>One day being in the <hi>Alcana</hi> at <hi>Toledo,</hi> I ſaw a young Lad offer to ſell a Parcel of old written
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54446:55"/>
Papers to a Groom; now I being apt to take up the leaſt piece of written or printed Papers that lies in my way, tho 'twere in the middle of the ſtreet, cou'd not forbear laying my hands on one of the quires, to ſee what it was, and I found it to be written in <hi>Arabick,</hi> which I cou'd not read. This made me look about to ſee whether I cou'd find e're a <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Rabbi to read it for me, and give me ſome account of it; nor was it very difficult to meet with an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter there, for had I wanted one for a better and more ancient Tongue that place wou'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly have ſupply'd me. 'Twas my good Fortune to find one immediately, and having inform'd him of my deſire, he no ſooner read ſome lines, but he began to laugh: I ask'd him what he laught at?

I pray'd him to explain it; whereupon, ſtill laughing, he did it in theſe words. <hi>This</hi> Dulcinea del To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſo, <hi>ſo often mention'd in this Hiſtory, is ſaid to have had the beſt hand at Salting of Pork of any Woman in all</hi> La Mancha. I was ſurpriz'd when I heard him name <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo,</hi> and preſently imagin'd that thoſe old Papers contain'd the Hiſtory of <hi>Don Quixote.</hi> This made me preſs him to read the Title of the Book, which he did, turning it thus <hi>extempore</hi> out of <hi>Arabick, The Hiſtory of</hi> Don Quixote de la Mancha, <hi>written by</hi> Cid Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met Benengely, <hi>an</hi> Arabian <hi>Hiſtoriographer.</hi> I was ſo overjoy'd when I heard the Title, that I had much ado to conceal it; and preſently taking the Bargain out of the Grooms hands, I agreed with the young man for the whole, and bought that for half a Real which he might have ſold me for twenty times as much, had he

but gueſs'd at the eagerneſs of his Chapman. I immediately withdrew with my Purchaſe to the Cloyſter of the great Church, taking the <hi>Moor</hi> with me; and deſir'd him to tranſlate me all thoſe papers that treated of <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> without adding or omitting the leaſt word: offering him any reaſonable ſatisfaction. He ask'd me but two<note n="*" place="bottom">An <hi>Arroba</hi> is about 32 <abbr>

                              <hi>Arrobes</hi> of Raiſins, and two Buſhels of Wheat, and promis'd me to do it faithfully with all expedition. In ſhort, for the quicker diſpatch, and the greater ſecurity, being unwilling to let ſuch a lucky prize go out of my hands, I took the <hi>Moor</hi> to my own houſe, where in leſs than ſix weeks he finiſh'd the whole Tranſlation.</p>

                              <hi>Don Quixote</hi>'s Fight with the <hi>Biſcayan</hi> was exactly drawn on one of the leaves of the firſt quire, in the ſame poſture as we left 'em, with their Swords lifted up over their heads, the one guarding himſelf with his Shield, the other with his Cuſhion. The <hi>Biſcayan</hi>'s Mule was pictur'd ſo to the life, that with half an eye you might have known it to be a hir'd Mule. Under the <hi>Biſcayan</hi> was written, <hi>Don Sancho de Aſpetia,</hi> and under <hi>Rozinante, Don Quixote. Rozinante</hi> was ſo admirably delineated, ſo ſlim, ſo ſtiff, ſo lank, ſo lean, ſo jaded, with ſo ſharp a Ridge-bone, and altogether ſo like one waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an incurable Conſumption, that any one muſt have own'd, at firſt ſight, that no Horſe ever better deſerv'd that name.

                              <hi>Cancas.</hi> And if we may judge of him by his Picture, he was thick and ſhort, paunch-belly'd, and long-haunch'd; ſo that in all likelihood for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he is ſometimes call'd <hi>Panca,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Cancas</hi> in the Hiſtory. There were ſome other niceties to be ſeen in that Piece, but hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worth obſervation, as not giving any light into this true Hiſtory, otherwiſe they had not paſt unmention'd. For none can be amiſs ſo they be authentic. I muſt only acquaint the Reader, that if any objection is to be made as to the veracity of this, 'tis only that the Author is an <hi>Arabian,</hi> and thoſe of that Country are not a little addicted to Lying. But yet if we conſider that they are our Enemies, we ſhou'd ſooner imagine that the Author has rather ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt the Truth, than added to the real worth of our Knight; and I am the more inclinable to think ſo, becauſe 'tis plain that where he ought to have inlarg'd upon his Praiſes, he maliciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chuſes to be ſilent. A proceeding unworthy of an Hiſtorian, who ought to be exact, ſincere, and impartial; free from paſſion, and not to be byaſs'd either by intereſt, fear, reſentment or affection, to deviate from Truth, which is the Mother of Hiſtory, the Preſerver and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizer of great Actions, the profeſt Enemy of Oblivion, the Witneſs of things paſt, and the Director of future Times. As for this Hiſtory, I know 'twill afford you as great variety as you cou'd wiſh in the moſt entertaining; and if in
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:54446:56"/>
any point it falls ſhort of your expectation, I am of opinion 'tis more the fault of the unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Author, than the ſubject; and ſo let us come to the Second Book, which, according to our Tranſlation, began in this manner</p>
                           <p>Such were the bold and formidable looks of the two enrag'd Combatants, that with up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifted Arms, and with deſtructive Steel, they ſeem'd to threaten Heaven, Earth, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal Manſions; while the ſpectators ſeem'd wholly loſt in fear and aſtoniſhment. The Cholerick <hi>Biſcayan</hi> diſcharg'd the firſt blow, and that with ſuch a prodigious force, and ſo deſperate a fury, that had not his Sword turn'd in his hand, that ſingle ſtroke had put an end to the dreadful Combat, and all our Knights Adventures. But Fate, that reſerv'd him for greater things, ſo order'd it, that his Enemy's Sword turn'd in ſuch a manner, that tho it ſtruck him on the left Shoulder, it did him no other hurt than to diſarm that ſide of his head, carrying away with it a great part of his Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, and one half of his Ear, which like a dreadful Ruin fell together to the ground. Aſſiſt me, ye Powers! But 'tis in vain: The Fury which then engroſt the Breaſt of our He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro of <hi>La Mahcha</hi> is not to be expreſt; words wou'd but wrong it; for what colour of Speech can be lively enough to give but a ſlight Sketch or faint Image of his unutterable Rage? Exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his Valour, he rais'd himſelf upon his Stirrups, and ſeem'd even greater than himſelf, and at the ſame inſtant griping his Sword faſt with both hands, he diſcharg'd ſuch a tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous blow full upon the <hi>Biſcayans</hi> Cuſhion and his Head, that in ſpight of ſo good a defence
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:54446:57"/>
as if a whole Mountain had faln upon him, the Blood guſht out at his Mouth, Noſe and Ears all at once, and he totter'd ſo in his Saddle, that he had faln to the ground immediately, had he not caught hold of the neck of his Mule. But the dull Beaſt itſelf being rous'd out of its ſtupidity with that terrible blow, began to run about the Fields, and the <hi>Biſcayan</hi> having loſt his Stirrups, and his hold, with two or three winces the Mule ſhook him off, and threw him on the ground. <hi>Don Quixote</hi> beheld the diſaſter of his Foe with the greateſt Tranquility and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern imaginable; and ſeeing him down, ſlipt nimbly from his Saddle, and running to him, ſet the point of his Sword to his Throat, and bid him yield, or he wou'd cut off his Head. The <hi>Biſcayan</hi> was ſo ſtunn'd that he cou'd make him no reply; ſo that <hi>Don Quixote</hi> had certainly made good his threats, had not the Ladies in the Coach, who with great uneaſineſs and fear had beheld theſe ſad tranſactions, haſten'd to beſeech <hi>Don Quixote</hi> very earneſtly to ſpare his life. Truly, Beautiful Ladies, ſaid the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Knight, with a great deal of loftineſs and gravity, I am willing to grant your Requeſt; but upon condition that this ſame Knight ſhall paſs his word of honour to go to <hi>Toboſo,</hi> and there preſent himſelf in my Name before the Peerleſs Lady <hi>Donna Dulcinea,</hi> that ſhe may diſpoſe of him as ſhe ſhall ſee convenient. The Lady, who was frighted almoſt out of her ſences, without conſidering what <hi>Don Quixote</hi> enjoyn'd, or enquiring who the Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi> was, promis'd in her Squires behalf, a punctual obedience to the Knights Commands. Let him live then, reply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> upon your

word, and owe to your Interceſſion, that Pardon, which I might juſtly deny his arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance.</p>

                              <hi>SAncho Panca</hi> was got up again before this, not much the better for the Kicks and Thumps, beſtowed on his Carcaſs by the Monks Grooms; and, ſeeing his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter engag'd in Fight, he went devoutly to Prayers, beſeeching Heaven to grant him Victory, and that he might now win ſome Iſland, in order to his being made Governor of it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his promiſe. At laſt, perceiving the danger was over, the Combat at an end, and his Maſter ready to mount again, he ran in all haſte to help him; but e're the Knight put his Foot in the ſtirrup, <hi>Sancho</hi> fell on his Knees, before him, and kiſſing his hand, An't pleaſe your Worſhip, cry'd he, my good Lord, <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> I beſeech you to make me Governor of the Iſland, which you have won in this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and bloody Fight, for tho it were never ſo great, I find my ſelf able to govern it, as well as the beſt he that ever went about to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern an Iſland in this World. Brother <hi>Sancho,</hi> reply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> theſe are no Adventures of Iſlands; theſe are only Rencounters on the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54446:58"/>
Road, where little is to be got beſides a broken Head, or the loſs of an Ear; therefore have patience, and ſome Adventure will offer itſelf, which will not only enable me to prefer thee to a Government; but even to ſomething more conſiderable. <hi>Sancho</hi> gave him a world of Thanks, and having once more kiſs'd his hand, and the skirts of his Coat of Armor, he help'd him to get upon <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and then, leaping on his Aſs, he follow'd the Hero, who, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking leave of thoſe in the Coach, put on a good round Trot, and rode into a Wood, that was not far off. <hi>Sancho</hi> made after him as faſt as his Aſs wou'd trot; but finding that <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zinante</hi> was like to leave him behind, he was forc'd to call to his Maſter, to ſtay for him, <hi>Don Quixote</hi> accordingly check'd his Horſe, and ſoon gave <hi>Sancho</hi> leiſure to overtake him. Methinks, Sir, cry'd the fearful Squire, as ſoon as he came up with him, it won't be amiſs for us, to betake our ſelves to ſome Church, to get out of harms way; for if that ſame man whom you've fought with, ſhou'd do otherwiſe than well, I dare lay my life, they ll get a Warrant from the Holy Brotherhood, and have us taken up, which if they do, on my word, 'twill go hard with us, e're we can get out of their Clutches. Hold thy Tongue, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote!</hi> Where didſt thou ever read, or find, that any Knight Errant was ever brought before a Judge for the Homicides which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted? I can't tell what you mean by your <hi>homilies,</hi> reply'd <hi>Sancho;</hi> I don t know that ever I ſaw any in my born days, not I. But well I wot, that the Law lays hold on thoſe that go to murther one another in the Fields, and as for
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:54446:58"/>
your what d'ye call 'ems, I've nothing to ſay to em. Then be not affraid, good <hi>Sancho,</hi> cry'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> for I wou'd deliver thee out of the hands of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and with much more eaſe out of thoſe of the Holy Brotherhood. But come tell me truly, doſt thou believe the whole World can boaſt of another Knight, that may pretend to rival me in valour? Didſt thou ever read in Hiſtory, that any other ever ſhow'd more reſolution to undertake, more vigour to attack, more breath to hold out, more dexterity and activity to ſtrike, and more art and force to overthrow his Enemies? Not I, by my Troth, reply'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> for I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cou'd read nor write; but that which I dare wager, is, that I never in my Life ſerv'd a bolder maſter than your Worſhip; pray Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven this ſame boldneſs mayn't bring us to what I bid you beware of; all I've to put you in mind of now is, that you get your Ear dreſs'd, for you loſe a deal of Blood; and by good luck, I have here ſome Lint, and a little White-Salve in my Wallet. How needleſs wou'd all this have been, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> had I but bethought my ſelf of making a ſmall Bottle-full of the Balſam of <hi>Fierabras,</hi> a ſingle drop of which wou'd have ſpar'd us a great deal of Time and Medicaments! What is that ſame Balſam, an't pleaſe you, cry'd <hi>Sancho?</hi> A Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam, anſwer'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> of which I've the Receipt in my Head, he that has ſome of it may defy Death itſelf; and dally with all manner of wounds; therefore, when I have made ſome of it, and given it thee, if at any time thou happen'ſt to ſee my Body cut in two, by ſome unlucky Back-ſtroke, as 'tis common among us
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54446:59"/>
Knights-Errant, thou haſt no more to do, but to take up nicely that half of me, whith is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len to the Ground, and clap it exactly to the other half on the Saddle, before the Blood's congeal'd, always taking care to lay it juſt in its proper place; then thou ſhalt give me two Draughts of that Balſam, and thou ſhalt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſee me become whole and ſound as an Apple. If this be true, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I'll quit you of your Promiſe about the Iſland this minute of an hour, and will have nothing of your Worſhip, for what ſervice I have done, and am to do you, but the Receipt of that ſame Balſam; for I dare ſay, let me go where-ever I will, 'twill be ſure to yield me three good Reals an Ounce, and thus I ſhall make ſhift to pick a pretty good livelihood out on't. But ſtay tho, continu'd he, do's the making ſtand your Worſhip in much, Sir? Three Quarts of it, reply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> may be made for leſs than 3 Reals. Body of me, cry'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> why don't you make ſome out of hand, and teach me how to make it. Say no more, Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> return'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> I intend to teach thee much greater ſecrets, and deſign thee nobler Rewards; but in the mean time dreſs my Ear, for it pains me more than I cou'd wiſh. <hi>Sancho</hi> then took his Lint and Ointment out of his Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let; but when <hi>Don Quixote</hi> perceiv'd the Vizor of his Helmet was broken, he had like to have run ſtark ſtaring mad, ſtrait laying hold on his Sword, and lifting up his Eyes to Heaven, By the Bowels of my Father, cry'd he, by my Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> by the whole Frame of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I ſwear to lead a Life like the great Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of <hi>Mantua,</hi> when he made a vow to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:54446:59"/>
the Death of his Couſin <hi>Baldwin,</hi> which was never to eat Bread on a Table-cloath, never to lye with the dear partner of his Bed, and other things, which, tho they are now at this time ſlipt out of my memory, I comprize in my Vow, no leſs than if I had now mention'd 'em, and this I bind my ſelf to, till I have fully reveng'd my ſelf on him, that has done me this injury.</p>
                           <p>Good your Worſhip, (cry'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> amaz'd to hear him take ſuch a horrid Oath) think on what you're doing: for if that ſame Knight has done as you bid him, and has gone and caſt himſelf before my Lady <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo,</hi> I don't ſee but he and you are quit, and the man deſerves no further puniſhment, unleſs he does you ſome new miſchief. 'Tis well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, reply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> and therefore as to the point of Revenge I revoke my Oath; but I renew and confirm it, proteſting ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to lead the life I mention'd, till I have by force of Arms diſpoil'd ſome Knight of as good a Helmet as mine was. Neither do thou fancy, <hi>Sancho,</hi> that I make this proteſtation raſhly: No, I have a laudable precedent for it, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of which will ſufficiently juſtifie my Imitation; for the very ſame thing happen'd about <hi>Mambrino</hi>'s Helmet, which coſt <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pante</hi> ſo dear. Good Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> let all ſuch curſing and ſwearing go to the Devil, there's nothing can be worſe for your Souls health, nay, for your bodily health neither. Beſides, ſuppoſe we ſhou'd not this good while meet any one with a Helmet on, what a ſad caſe ſhou'd we then be in? Will your Worſhip then keep your Oath, in ſpight of ſo many hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54446:60"/>
ſuch as to lye rough for a month toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, far from any inhabited place, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other idle pennances which that mad old Marquis of <hi>Mantua</hi> puniſh'd himſelf with by his Vow: Do but conſider that we may ride I don't know how long upon this Road with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meeting any arm'd Knight to pick a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with; for here are none but Carriers and Waggoners, who are ſo far from wearing any Helmets, that 'tis ten to one whether they ever heard of ſuch a thing in their lives. Thou art miſtaken, friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> reply'd <hi>Don Quixote;</hi> for we ſhall not be two hours this way without meeting more Men in Arms than there were at the Siege of <hi>Albraca,</hi> to conquer the fair <hi>Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica.</hi> Well then, let it be ſo, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> and may we have the luck to come off well, and quickly win that Iſland which coſts me ſo dear, and then I don't matter what befalls me. I have already bid thee not trouble thy ſelf about this buſineſs, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid <hi>Don Quixote;</hi> for ſhou'd we miſs of an Iſland, there is either the Kingdom of <hi>Denmark</hi> or that of <hi>Sobradiſa,</hi> as fit for thy purpoſe as a Ring to thy finger, and, what ought to be no ſmall comfort to thee, they are both upon the Continent. But we'll talk of this in its proper ſeaſon: At this time I'd have thee ſee whether thou haſt any thing to eat in thy Wallet, that we may afterwards ſeek for ſome Caſtle where we may lodge this night, and make the Balſam I told thee; for, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, my Ear ſmarts extremely. I have here an Onion, reply'd the Squire, a piece of Cheeſe, and a few ſtale cruſts of Bread; but ſure ſuch courſe fare is not for ſuch a brave Knight as your Worſhip. Thou art groſsly miſtaken,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:54446:60"/>
friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> anſwer'd <hi>Don Quixote;</hi> know, that 'tis the glory of Knights-Errant to be whole months without eating; and when they do, they fall upon the firſt thing they meet with, tho it be never ſo homely; hadſt thou but read as many Books as I have done, thou hadſt been better inform'd as to that point; for tho I think I have read as many Hiſtories of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry in my time as any other man, I never cou'd find that the Knights-Errant ever eat, unleſs it were by meer accident, when they were invited to great Feaſts and Royal Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets; at other times they indulg'd themſelves with little other food beſides their thoughts; and tho it is not to be imagin'd they cou'd live without ſupplying the exigencies of humane nature, as being after all no more than mortal men; 'tis likewiſe to be ſuppos'd that as they ſpent the greateſt part of their lives in Foreſts and Deſarts, and always deſtitute of a Cook, conſequently their uſual food was but ſuch courſe Country fare as thou now offerſt me: Never then make thy ſelf uneaſie about what pleaſes me, Friend <hi>Sancho;</hi> nor pretend to make a new world, nor to unhinge the very Conſtitution and ancient Cuſtoms of Knight-Errantry. I beg your Worſhips pardon, cry'd <hi>Sancho;</hi> for, as I was never bred a Scholard, I may chance to have miſt in ſome main point of your Laws of Knighthood; but from this time forwards I'll be ſure to ſtock my Wallet with all manner of dry Fruits for you, becauſe your Worſhip's a Knight; as for my ſelf, who am none, I'll provide good Fowls, and other ſubſtantial Victuals. I don't ſay, <hi>Sancho,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> that a Knight-Errant is
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54446:61"/>
oblig'd to feed altogether upon Fruit; I only mean, that this was their common food, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſome Roots and Herbs, which they found up and down the Fields, of all which they had a perfect knowledge, as I my ſelf have. 'Tis a good thing to know thoſe Herbs, cry'd <hi>Sancho;</hi> for, I am much miſtaken, or that kind of knowledge will ſtand us in good ſtead e're long. In the mean time, continu'd he, here's what good Heaven has ſent us. With that, he pull'd out the proviſion he had, and they fell to heartily together. But their impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to find out a place where they might be harbour'd that night, made 'em ſhorten their ſorry meal, and mount again, for fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But the Sun and their hopes fail'd 'em at once, as they came to a place where ſome Goat-herds had ſet up ſome ſmall Huts; and therefore they concluded to take up their Lodging there that night. This was as great a mortification to <hi>Sancho,</hi> who was altogether for a good Town, as it was a pleaſure to his Maſter, who was for ſleeping in the open Field, as believing that as often as he did it he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd his Title to Knighthood, by a new act of poſſeſſion.</p>

                           <p>THe Knight was very courteouſly receiv'd by the Goat-herds; and as for <hi>Sancho,</hi> after he had ſet up <hi>Rozinante</hi> and his Aſs as well as he cou'd, he preſently repair'd to the attractive ſmell of ſome pieces of Kids fleſh which ſtood boiling in a Kettle, over the fire. The hungry Squire wou'd immediately have try'd whether they were fit to be remov'd out of the Kettle into his Stomach, but was not put to that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for the Goat-herds took 'em off the fire, and having ſpread ſome Sheep-skins on the ground, ſoon got their rural Feaſt ready, and chearfully invited his Maſter and him to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of what they had. Next, with ſome courſe Complements after the Country way, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd <hi>Don Quixote</hi> to ſit down on a Trough with the bottom upwards, and then ſix of 'em, who were all that belong'd to the Fold, ſquatted 'em down round the Skins; While <hi>Sancho</hi> ſtood to wait upon his Maſter, and give him drink in a Horn Cup, which the Goat-herds us'd. But he, ſeeing his man ſtand behind, ſaid to him; That thou mayſt underſtand, <hi>Sancho,</hi> the Benefits of Knight-Errantry, and how the meaneſt Retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to it have a fair proſpect of being ſpeedily eſteem'd and honour'd by the world, tis my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that thou ſit thee down by me, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany

of theſe good people, that there be no difference now obſerv'd between thee and me, that thou eat in the ſame Diſh, and drink in the ſame Cup: For, it may be ſaid of Knight-Errantry as of Love, that it makes all Things equal. I thank your Worſhip, cry'd <hi>Sancho;</hi> but yet I muſt needs own, had I but a good deal of meat before me, I'd eat it as well, or rather better ſtanding, and by my ſelf, than if I ſat by an Emperor; and to deal plainly and truly with you, I had rather munch a cruſt of brown Bread and an Onion in a corner, without any more ado or ceremony, than feed upon Turkey at another Mans Table, where one is fain to ſit mincing and chawing his Meat an hour together, drink little, be always wiping his Fingers and his Chops, and never dare to Cough nor Sneeze, tho he has never ſo much a mind to it, nor do a many things, which a Body may do freely by ones ſelf; therefore, good Sir, change thoſe tokens of your kindneſs which I have a right to, by being your Worſhips Squire, into ſomething that may do me more good; as for theſe ſame ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours I heartily thank you, as much as if I had accepted of 'em, but yet I give up my right to 'em from this time to the world's end.

The firſt Courſe being over, they brought in the ſecond, conſiſting of dry'd

Acorns, and half a Cheeſe as hard as a Brick. Nor was the Horn idle all this while, but went merrily round up and down ſo many times, ſometimes full and ſometimes empty, like the two Buckets of a Well, that they made ſhift at laſt to drink off one of the two Skins of Wine which they had there. And now <hi>Don Quixote</hi> having ſatisfy'd his appetite, he took a handful of Acorns, and looking earneſtly upon 'em, O happy age, cry'd he, which our firſt parents call'd the age of Gold; not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Gold, ſo much ador'd in this Iron Age, was then eaſily purchas'd; but becauſe thoſe two fatal words Mine and Thine were diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions unknown to the people of thoſe fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Times. For all Things were in common in that holy age. Men for their ſuſtenance needed only to lift their hands, and take it from the ſturdy Oak, whoſe ſpreading arms liberally invited 'em to gather the wholſome ſavoury Fruit; while the clear Springs, and ſilver Rivulets, with luxuriant plenty offer'd 'em their pure refreſhing Water. In hollow Trees, and in the Clefts of Rocks, the labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and induſtrious Bees erected their little Commonwealths, that men might reap with pleaſure and with eaſe the ſweet and fertile harveſt of their Soils. The tough and ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cork-Trees did of themſelves, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out other art than their native Liberality, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs and impart their broad light Bark, which ſerv'd to cover thoſe lowly Huts, propt up with rough-hewn Stakes, that were firſt built as a ſhelter againſt the Inclemencies of the air.

Plough-ſhare preſum'd with violence to open and pry into the pious Bowels of our Mother Earth; for ſhe without Compulſion kindly yielded from every part of her fruitful and ſpacious boſom whatever might at once ſatisfie, ſuſtain and indulge her frugal Children. Then was the time when innocent beautiful young Shepherdeſſes went tripping o're the Hills and Vales, their lovely hair, ſometimes plaited, ſometimes looſe and flowing, clad in no other veſtment but what was neceſſary to cover de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently what Modeſty wou'd always have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd. The <hi>Tyrian</hi> Dye, and the rich gloſſy hue of Silk, martyr'd and diſſembled into eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry colour, which are now eſteem'd ſo fine and magnificent, were unknown to the innocent plainneſs of that age; yet bedeckt with more becoming Leaves and Flowers, they might be ſaid to outſhine the proudeſt of the vain dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Ladies of our age array'd in the moſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent garbs, and all the moſt ſumptuous adornings, which Idleneſs and Luxury have taught ſucceeding Pride. Lovers then expreſt the Paſſion of their Souls in the unaffected Language of the Heart, with the native plainneſs and ſincerity in which they were conceiv'd, and diveſted of all that artificial Contexture which enervates what it labours to enforce.

Cauſes to be judg'd. But in this degenerate age, Fraud, and a Legion of Ills infecting the World, no Virtue can be ſafe, no Honour be ſecure, while wanton Deſires, diffus'd into the hearts of Men, corrupt the ſtricteſt watches, and the cloſeſt retreats; which, tho as intricate and unknown as the <hi>Labyrinth</hi> of <hi>Crete,</hi> are no ſecurity for Chaſtity. Thus that primitive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence being vaniſh'd, and Oppreſſion daily prevailing, there was a neceſſity to oppoſe the Torrent of Violence. For which reaſon the order of Knighthood-Errant was inſtituted, to defend the honour of Virgins, protect Widows, relieve Orphans, and aſſiſt all the diſtreſs'd in general. Now I my ſelf am one of this Order, honeſt Friends; and tho all People are oblig'd by the law of Nature, to be kind to Perſons of my Order, I ought to pay a particular acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the good entertainment, which you ſo generouſly afford me and my Squire; the rather, as you have done it without being in the leaſt acquainted with my circumſtances; and therefore with all the ſincerity imaginable, I return you my hearty thanks.</p>
                           <p>All this long Oration, which might very well have been ſpared, was owing to the Acorns, that recall'd the Golden age to our Knights re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, and made him thus hold forth to the Goat-herds, who devoutly liſten'd, but edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd little, the Diſcourſe not being ſuited to their Capacities. <hi>Sancho,</hi> as well as they, was ſilent all the while, eating Acorns, and frequently viſiting the ſecond Skin of Wine, which for Coolneſs-ſake was hung upon a neighboring Cork-Tree.

Supper; when he had done, one of the Goat-herds addreſſing himſelf to him, Sir Knight, ſaid he, that you may be ſure you're heartily welcom, we'll get one of our Fellows to give us a Song: He is juſt a coming: A good notable young Lad he is, I'll ſay that for him, and up to the Ears in Love. He's a Scholard, and can read and write, and plays ſo rarely upon the Fiddle that 'tis a charm but to hear him. No ſooner were the words out of the Goat-herds mouth, but they heard the ſound of the Inſtrument he ſpoke of, and preſently appear'd a good comely young man of about two and twenty years of Age. The Goat-herds ask'd him if he had ſupp'd? and he having told them he had, Then, dear <hi>Antonio,</hi> ſays the firſt ſpeaker, prethee ſing us a Song, to let this Gentleman, our gueſt, ſee that we have thoſe amongſt us who know ſomewhat of Muſick, for all we live amidſt Woods and Mountains.

Good Sir, quoth he, your Worſhip had better go and lye down where you are to take your reſt this night; beſides, theſe good people are tir'd with their days labour, and rather want to go to ſleep than to ſit up all night to hear Ballads. I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thee, <hi>Sancho,</hi> cry'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> and indeed I thought thy frequent viſiting the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle wou'd make thee fonder of ſleep than of Muſic.

What news, cry'd one of the Company? That fine Shepherd and Scholar <hi>Chryſtoſtome</hi> dy'd this morning, anſwer'd the other; and they ſay, 'twas for Love of that deviliſh untoward Laſs <hi>Marcella,</hi> rich <hi>William</hi>'s Daughter, that goes up and down the Country after the way of a Shepherdeſs. For <hi>Marcella,</hi> cry'd one of the Goat-herds?

Nay, he has likewiſe order'd many other ſtrange things to be done, which the head of the Pariſh won't allow of, for they ſeem to be after the way of the Pagans. But <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> the other Scholar, who likewiſe reparell'd himſelf like a Shepherd, is reſolv'd to have his Friend <hi>Chryſtoſtome</hi> s Will fulfill'd in every thing, juſt as he has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd

it. All the Village is in an uproar, but after all 'tis thought, <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and his Friends will carry the day; and to morrow morning he is to be buried in great ſtate, where I told you; I fancy 'twill be worth ſeeing; howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be it what it will, I'll e'en go and ſee it. Well all go, cry'd the Goat-herds, and caſt lots who ſhall tarry to look after the Goats.

                              <hi>Peter</hi> made anſwer, That all he knew of the matter was, That the Deceaſed was a wealthy Gentleman, who liv'd not far off, that he had been ſeveral years at the Univerſity of <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manca,</hi> and then came home mightily improv'd in his Learning: But above all, quoth he, 'twas ſaid of him that he had great knowledge in the Stars, and whatſoever the Sun and Moon do in the Skies; for he wou'd tell us to a tittle the <hi>Clip</hi> of the Sun and Moon. We call it an Eclipſe, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> and not a Clip, when either of thoſe two great Lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are darken'd.

Parents and Friends being rul'd by him grew woundy rich in a ſhort time; for he wou'd tell 'em, This year ſow Barley, and no Wheat: In this you may ſow Peaſe, and no Barley: Next year will be a good year for Oyl: The three after that you ſhan't gather a drop; and whatſoever he ſaid wou'd certainly come to paſs. That Science, ſaid <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> is call'd Aſtrology. I don't know what you call it, anſwer'd <hi>Peter,</hi> but I know he knew all this, and a deal more. But, in ſhort, within ſome few months after he had left the Verſity, on a certain morning we ſaw him come dreſt for all the world like a Shepherd, and driving his Flock, having laid down the long Gown, which he us d to wear as a Scholar.

that the reaſon of his altering his garb in that faſhion, was only that he might go up and down after that Shepherdeſs <hi>Marcella,</hi> whom our Comrade told you of before, for he was faln mightily in love with her. And now Ill tell you ſuch a thing you never heard the like in your born days, and mayn't chance to hear of ſuch another while you breath, tho you were to live as long as <hi>Sarnah.</hi> Say <hi>Sarah,</hi> cry'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> who hated to hear him blunder thus. The <hi>Sarna,</hi> or the <hi>Scab,</hi> (for that's all one with us, quoth <hi>Peter</hi>) lives long enough too; and if you go on thus, and make me break off my Tale at every word, we an't like to have done this twelvemonth. Pardon me, Friend, reply'd <hi>Don Quixote;</hi> I only ſpoke to make thee underſtand that there's a difference between <hi>Sarna</hi> and <hi>Sarah:</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, thou ſayſt well; for the <hi>Sarna</hi> (that is, the Scab) lives longer than <hi>Sarah;</hi> therefore pray make an end of thy ſtory; for I will not interrupt thee any more. Well then, quoth <hi>Peter,</hi> you muſt know, good maſter of mine, that there liv'd near us one <hi>William,</hi> a Yeoman, who was richer yet than <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>'s Father, now he had no Child in the varſal World, but a Daughter, her Mother dy'd in Child-bed of her (reſt her Soul) and was as good a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as ever went upon two Legs. Methinks, I ſee her yet ſtanding afore me, with that bleſs'd Face of hers, the Sun on one ſide, and the Moon on the t'other. She was a main Houſewife, and did a deal of good among the Poor; for which I dare ſay ſhe is at this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute in Paradice. Alas! her death broke old <hi>William</hi>'s heart, he ſoon went after her, poor
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:54446:67"/>
man, and left all to his little Daughter, that <hi>Marcella</hi> by name, giving charge of her to her Unkle, the Parſon of our Pariſh. Well, the Girl grew ſuch a fine Child, and ſo like her Mother, that it us'd to put us in mind of her every foot. However, 'twas thought ſhe'd make a finer Woman yet, and ſo it happen'd indeed; for, by that time ſhe was fourteen or fifteen years of age, no man ſat his eyes on her, that did not bleſs Heaven for having made her ſo handſome; ſo that moſt men fell in love with her, and were ready to run mad for her. All this while, her Unkle kept her as charily as the Apple of his Eye, and as cloſe as an Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer's Gold. Yet the report of her great Beauty and Wealth ſpread far and near, inſomuch, that ſhe had I don't know how many Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearts, almoſt all the young men in our Town ask'd her of her Unkle; nay, from I don't know how many Leagues about us, there flock'd whole Droves of ſuiters, and the very beſt in the Country too, who all begg'd and ſu'd, and teiz'd her Unkle to let them have her. But tho he'd have been glad to have got fairly rid of her, as ſoon as ſhe was fit for a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, yet wou'd not he adviſe or marry her againſt her Will; for he's a good Man, Ill ſay that for him, and a true Chriſtian every inch of him, and ſcorn'd to keep her from marrying to make a benefit of her Eſtate; and to his praiſe be it ſpoken, he has been mainly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for't more than once, when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our Pariſh meet together. For I muſt tell you, Sir Errant, that here in the Country, and in our little Towns, there's not the leaſt thing can be ſaid or done, but people will talk
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54446:68"/>
on't; but let buſy Bodies prate as they pleaſe, my Life for yours, the Parſon muſt have been a good Body indeed, who cou'd bring his Pariſh to give him a good Word, eſpecially in the Country. Thou'rt in the right, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> and therefore go on, honeſt <hi>Peter,</hi> for the Story is pleaſant, and thou tell'ſt it with a Grace. May I never want grace, quoth <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and may I be ſure to tell our Flocks right, for that's the telling moſt to the purpoſe. But for our Parſon, as I told you before, he was not for keeping his Niece from marrying, and therefore he took care to let her know of all thoſe that wou d have taken her to Wife, both what they were, and what they had, and he was at her, to have her pitch upon one of 'em for a Husband; yet wou'd ſhe never anſwer otherwiſe, but that ſhe had no mind to Wed as yet, as finding herſelf too young for the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of Wedlock. With theſe and ſuch like come-offs, ſhe got her Unkle to let her alone, and wait till ſhe thought fit to chuſe for her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. For he was won t to ſay, that Parents are not to beſtow their Children, where they bear no liking, and in that he ſpoke like an honeſt Man. And thus it happened, that when we leaſt dreamt of it, that coy Laſs, finding her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at liberty, wou'd needs turn Shepherdeſs, and neither her Unkle, nor all thoſe of the Village who advis'd her againſt it, cou'd work any thing upon her, but away ſhe went to the Fields to keep her own Sheep with the other young Laſſes of the Town. But then 'twas ten times worſe, for no ſooner was ſhe ſeen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, when I can't tell how many ſpruce Gallants, both Gentlemen and rich Farmers
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:54446:68"/>
chang'd their garb for love of her, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd her up and down in Shepherds guiſe. One of 'em, as I have told you, was this ſame <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> who now lies dead, of whom 'tis ſaid, he not only lov'd, but worſhipp'd her. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, I wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For tho ſhe does not ſhun the Company of Shepherds, but uſes 'em courteouſly, ſo far as they behave themſelves handſomly, yet whenſoever any one of 'em does but offer to break his mind to her, be it never ſo well meant, and only in order to marry, ſhe caſts him away from her, as with a Sling, and will never have any more to ſay to him.</p>
                           <p>And thus this fair Maiden does more harm in this Country, than the Plague wou'd do; for her courteouſneſs and fair looks draw on every body to love her; but then her dogged, ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born coyneſs breaks their Hearts, and makes 'em ready to hang themſelves, and all they can do, poor wretches, is to make a heavy complaint, and call her cruel, unkind, ungrateful, and a world of ſuch names, whereby they plainly ſhow what a ſad condition they are in: were you but to ſtay here ſome time, you'd hear theſe Hills ring again, with the doleful moans of thoſe ſhe has deny d, who yet can't for the blood of em give over ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:54446:69"/>
have a place not far off, where there are ſome two dozen of Beech-trees, and on 'em all you may find I don't know how many <hi>Marcella</hi>'s cut into the ſmooth Bark. On ſome of 'em there's a Crown carv'd over the Name, as much as to ſay that <hi>Marcella</hi> bears away the Crown, and deſerves the Garland of Beauty. Here ſighs one Shepherd, there another whines; here one is ſinging doleful Ditties, there ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is wringing his hands and making woful complaints. You ſhall have one lay him down at night at the Foot of a Rock, or by ſome Oak, and there lye weeping and wailing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a wink of ſleep, and talking to himſelf till the Sun finds him there the next morning; you ſhall have another lye ſtretch'd upon the hot ſandy ground, breathing his ſad lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Heaven, without heeding the ſultry heat of the Summer-Sun. And all this while the hard-hearted <hi>Marcella</hi> ne're minds any one of 'em, and does not ſeem to be the leaſt concern'd for 'em. We are all mightily at a loſs to know what will be the end of all this Pride and Coy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who ſhall be the happy man that ſhall at laſt tame her, and bring her to his Lure. Now becauſe there's nothing more certain than all this, I am the more apt to give Credit to what our Comrade has told us, as to the occaſion of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>'s Death; and therefore I wou'd needs have you go and ſee him laid in's Grave to morrow; which I believe will be worth your while, for he had many Friends, and 'tis not half a league to the place where 'twas his Will to be buried. I intend to be there, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> and in the mean time I return thee many thanks for the extraordinary
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:54446:69"/>
ſatisfaction this ſtory has afforded me. Alas, Sir Knight, reply'd the Goat-herd, I have not told you half the miſchiefs this proud Creature has done here, but to morrow mayhap we ſhall meet ſome Shepherd by the way that will be able to tell you more. Mean while it won't be amiſs for you to take your reſt in one of the Huts; for the open air is not good for your wound, tho what I've put to it is ſo ſpecial a Med'cine that there's not much need to fear but 'twill do well enough. <hi>Sancho,</hi> who was quite out of patience with the Goat-herds long Story, ſeconded him in his good advice to his Maſter, and at laſt prevail'd with him to lye down in <hi>Peter</hi>'s Hut, where <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> in Imitation of <hi>Marcella</hi>'s Lovers, devoted the remainder of the night to amorous Expoſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with his Dear <hi>Dulcinea.</hi> As for <hi>Sancho,</hi> he laid himſelf down between <hi>Rozinante</hi> and his Aſs, and ſlept it out; not like a diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Lover, but like a man that had been ſoundly kick'd and bruis'd in the morning.</p>

Thereupon
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:54446:70"/>
the Knight, who deſir'd nothing more, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently aroſe, and order'd <hi>Sancho</hi> to get <hi>Rozi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nante</hi> and the Aſs ready immediately; which he did with all expedition, and then they ſet forwards. They had not yet gone a quarter of a league before they ſaw advancing towards 'em, out of a croſs-path, ſix Shepherds clad in black Skins, their Heads crown'd with Garlands of <hi>Cypreſs</hi> and bitter <hi>Coaſt-mary,</hi> with long Holly-Staves in their hands. Two Gentlemen on Horſe-back, attended by three Lacqueys on foot, came immediately after 'em: As they drew near, they ſaluted one another civilly, and after the uſual queſtion, Which way dye tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel? they found they were all going the ſame way to ſee the Funeral, and ſo they all join'd company. I fancy, Senior <hi>Vivaldo,</hi> ſaid one of the Gentlemen, addreſſing himſelf to the other, we ſhall not think our time miſ-ſpent in going to ſee this famous Funeral; for it muſt of neceſſity be very extraordinary, according to the account which theſe men have given us of the dead Shepherd and his Miſtreſs. I am ſo far of your opinion, anſwer'd <hi>Vivaldo,</hi> that I wou d not only ſtay one day, but a whole week rather than miſs the ſight. This gave <hi>Don Quixote</hi> occaſion to ask 'em what they had heard concerning <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Marcella?</hi> One of the Gentlemen made anſwer, That ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving met that morning with thoſe Shepherds, they cou'd not forbear enquiring of 'em, why they wore ſuch a mournful Dreſs? Whereupon one of 'em acquainted 'em with the ſad occaſion, by relating the Story of a certain Shepherdeſs, nam'd <hi>Marcella,</hi> no leſs lovely than cruel, whoſe coyneſs and diſdain has made a world of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:54446:70"/>
unfortunate Lovers, and caus'd the death of that <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> to whoſe Funeral they were going. In ſhort, he repeated to <hi>Don Quixote</hi> all that <hi>Peter</hi> had told him the night before. After this, <hi>Vivaldo</hi> ask'd the Knight why he travell'd ſo compleatly arm'd in ſo peaceable a Country? My profeſſion, anſwer'd the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, does not permit me to ride otherwiſe. Luxurious Feaſts, ſumptuous Dreſſes, and downy Eaſe, were invented for effeminate Courtiers; but Labour, Vigilance and Arms, are the portion of thoſe whom the world calls Knights-Errant, of which number I have the honour to be one, tho the moſt unworthy, and the meaneſt of the Fraternity. He needed to ſay no more to ſatisfy 'em his Brains were out of order; however, that they might the better underſtand the nature of his Folly, <hi>Vivaldo</hi> ask'd him, what he meant by a Knight-Errant? Have you not read then, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> the Annals and Hiſtory of <hi>Britain,</hi> where are recorded the famous deeds of King <hi>Arthur,</hi> who, according to an ancient Tradition in that Kingdom, never dy'd, but was turn'd into a Crow by Inchantment, and ſhall one day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume his former Shapes, and recover his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom again? For which reaſon ſince that time, the people of <hi>Great Britain</hi> dare not offer to kill a Crow. In this good Kings time, the moſt noble Order of the Knights of the Round Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was firſt inſtituted and then alſo the Amours between Sir <hi>Lancelot Du Lake,</hi> and Queen <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n v r</hi> were really tranſacted, as that Hiſtory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, they being manag d and carry'd on by the Mediation of that Honourable Matron the Lady <hi>Quintaniana.</hi> Which produc'd that Noted Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance ſo celebrated here in <hi>Spain,</hi>

                                 <l>There never was on Earth a Knight</l>
                                 <l>So waited on by Ladies fair,</l>
                                 <l>As once was he Sir <hi>Lancelot</hi> hight,</l>

                           <p>And the reſt, which gives ſo delightful an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count both of his Loves and feats of Arms. From that time the order of Knight-Errantry begun by degrees to dilate and extend itſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to moſt parts of the world. Then did the great <hi>Amadis de Gaul</hi> ſignalize himſelf by Heroick Exploits, and ſo did his Off-ſpring to the fifth Generation. The valorous <hi>Felixmart</hi> of <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cania</hi> got then immortal Fame, and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted Knight <hi>Tirante</hi> the White, who never can be applauded to his worth. Nay, had we but liv'd a little ſooner, we might have been bleſt with the converſation of that invincible Knight of our Modern times, the valorous <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> of <hi>Greece.</hi> And this, Gentlemen, is that order of Chivalry, which, unworthy as I am, I profeſs, with a due obſervance of the Laws which thoſe brave Knights obſerv'd before me; and for that reaſon I chuſe to wander thro theſe ſolitary Deſarts, ſeeking Adventures, fully reſolv'd to expoſe my perſon to the moſt formidable dangers which Fortune can obtrude on me, that by the ſtrength of my arm I may relieve the weak and the diſtreſs'd.</p>
                           <p>After all this ſtuff, you may be ſure the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers were ſufficiently convinc'd of <hi>Don Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote</hi>'s frenzical folly. Nor were they leſs ſupriz'd than were all thoſe who had hitherto diſcover d ſo unaccountable a diſtraction in one who ſeem'd a rational Creature. However, <hi>Vivaldo,</hi> who was of a gay diſpoſition, had no ſooner made
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:54446:71"/>
the diſcovery, but he reſolved to make the beſt advantage of it, that the ſhortneſs of the way wou'd allow him.</p>
                           <p>Therefore, to give him further occaſion to divert 'em with his Whimſies, Methinks, Sir Knight-Errant, ſaid he to him, you have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up one of the ſtricteſt and moſt mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Profeſſions in the world. I don't think but that a <hi>Carthuſian</hi> Fryar has a better time on't than you have. Perhaps, anſwer'd <hi>Don Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote,</hi> the Profeſſion of a <hi>Carthuſian</hi> may be as auſtere, but I ſomewhat doubt, whether it may be as beneficial to the world as ours. For, if we muſt ſpeak the truth, the Souldier who puts his Captains Command in execution, may be ſaid to do as much at leaſt as the Captain who commanded him. The application is eaſie: For while thoſe Religious men have nothing to do, but with all quietneſs and ſecurity to ſay their Prayers for the Proſperity of the World, We Knights, like Souldiers, effect what they do but demand, and procure thoſe Benefits to Mankind, by the ſtrength of our Arms, and at the hazard of our Lives, for which they only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede. Nor do we do this ſhelter'd from the injuries of the Air, but under no other roof but that of the wide Heavens, expos'd to Summers ſcorching heat, and Winters pinching cold. So that we may juſtly ſtile ourſelves The Miniſters of Heaven, and the Inſtruments of its Juſtice upon Earth; and as the buſineſs of the War is not to be compaſt without vaſt Toyl and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, ſo the Religious Souldier muſt undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be preferr'd before the Religious Monk, who living ſtill quiet, and at eaſe, has nothing to do but to pray for the afflicted and diſtreſſed.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:54446:72"/>
However, Gentlemen, do not imagine I wou'd inſinuate as if the Profeſſion of a Knight-Errant were a ſtate of Perfection equal to that of a holy Recluſe: I wou d only infer from what I've ſaid, and what I my ſelf endure, that ours is without queſtion more laborious, more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Diſcipline of heavy Blows, to Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, to the penance of Hunger and Thirſt, and in a word, to Rags, to Want and Miſery. For if you find that ſome Knights-Errant have at laſt by their Valour been rais'd to Thrones and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, you may be ſure it has been ſtill at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of much Sweat and Blood And had even thoſe happier Knights been depriv'd of thoſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting Sages and Inchanters, who helpt 'em in all Emergencies, they wou'd have been ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſappointed of their mighty Expectations. I am of the ſame opinion, reply d <hi>Vivaldo.</hi> But one thing among many others, which I can by no means approve in your Prof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ſſion, is, that when you are juſt going to engage in ſome very hazardous Adventure, where your Lives are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to be much endanger'd, you never take care to implore the aſſiſtance of Heaven, as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Chriſtian ought to do on ſuch occaſions, but only recommend your ſelves to your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, and that with as great Zeal and Devotion as if you worſhipp'd no other Deities; a thing, which, in my opinion, ſtrongly reliſhes of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſm. Sir, reply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> there's no altering that method; for ſhou'd a Knight-Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant do otherwiſe, he wou'd too much deviate from the ancient and eſtabliſh'd Cuſtoms of Knight-Errantry; which inviolably oblige him juſt in the moment when he is ruſhing on, and giving birth to ſome dubious Atchievement, to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:54446:72"/>
have his Miſtreſs ſtill before his Eyes, ſtill preſent to his mind by a ſtrong and lively Imagination, and with ſoft amorous energetick Looks im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore her Favour and Protection in that uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Trance. Nay, if no body can overhear him, he's oblig'd to whiſper, or ſpeak between his teeth ſome ſhort Ejaculations, to recommend himſelf with all the fervency imaginable to the Lady of his Wiſhes, and of this we have innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Examples in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>iſtory. Nor are you for all this to imagine that Knights-Errant omit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending themſelves to Heaven; for they they have leiſure enough to do it, even in the midſt of the Combat.</p>
                           <p>Sir, reply'd <hi>Vivaldo,</hi> you muſt give me leave to tell you, I am not yet thoroughly ſatisfi'd in this point. For I have often obſerv d in my Reading, that 2 Knights-Errant, having firſt talkt a little together, have faln out preſently, and been ſo highly provok'd, that, having turn d their Horſe-heads to gain room for the Career, they have wheel'd about, and then with all ſpeed run full Tilt at one another, haſtily recommending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their Miſtreſſes in the midſt of their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer; and the next thing has commonly been, that one of 'em has been thrown to the ground over the Crupper of his Horſe, fairly whipp d thro and through with his Enemies Lance; and the other forc'd to catch hold of his Horſes Mane to keep himſelf from falling Now I cannot appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend how the Knight that was ſlain had any time to recommend himſelf to Heaven, when his buſineſs was done ſo ſuddenly. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks thoſe haſty Invocations which in his Career were directed to his Miſtreſs, ſhou'd have been addreſt to Heaven, as every
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54446:73"/>
good Chriſtian wou'd have done. Beſides, I fancy every Knight Errant has not a Miſtreſs to invoke, nor is every one of 'em in Love. Your conjecture is wrong, anſwer'd <hi>Don Quixote;</hi> a Knight Errant cannot be without a Miſtreſs, 'tis not more eſſential to the Skies to have Stars, than 'tis to us to be in Love. Inſomuch, that I dare affirm, that no Hiſtory ever made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any Knight Errant, that was not a Lover, for were any Knight free from the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes of that generous Paſſion, he wou'd not be allow'd to be a lawful Knight; but a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Intruder, and one who was not admitted within the pale of Knight-hood at the Door, but leap d the Fence, and ſtole in like a Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and a Thief. Yet, Sir, reply'd the other, I'm much miſtaken, or I have read that <hi>Don Galaor,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Amadis,</hi> never had any certain Miſtreſs to recommend himſelf to, and yet for all that, he was not the leſs eſteem'd. One Swallow never makes a Summer, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd <hi>Don Quixote.</hi> Beſides, I know, that Knight was privately very much in Love; and as for his making his addreſſes, where-ever he met with Beauty, this was an effect of his natural inclination, which he cou'd not eaſily reſtrain. But after all, 'tis an undeniable truth, that he had a favorite Lady, whom he had Crown'd Empreſs of his Will, and to her he frequently recommended himſelf in private, for he did not a little value himſelf upon his diſcretion and ſecrecy in Love. Then, Sir, ſaid <hi>Vivaldo,</hi> ſince 'tis ſo much the Being of Knight-Errantry to be in Love, I preſume, you, who are of that Profeſſion, cannot be without a Miſtreſs. And therefore, if you do not ſet up for ſecrecy as
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:54446:73"/>
much as <hi>Don Galaor</hi> did, give me leave to beg of you in the name of all the Company, that you will be pleaſed ſo far to oblige us, as to let us know the name and quality of your Miſtreſs, the place of her Birth, and the Charms of her Perſon. For without doubt, the Lady cannot but eſteem herſelf happy in being known by all the world to be the object of the wiſhes of a Knight ſo accompliſh'd as your ſelf. With that <hi>Don Quixote</hi> breathing out a deep ſigh, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell, ſaid he, whether this lovely Enemy of my repoſe, is the leaſt affected with the world's being inform'd of her power o're my heart; all I dare ſay, in compliance with your Requeſt, is, that her Name is <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> her Country <hi>La Mancha,</hi> and <hi>Toboſo</hi> the happy place which ſhe honors with her Reſidence. As for her qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, it cannot be leſs than Princeſs, ſeeing ſhe is my Miſtreſs and my Queen. Her Beauty tranſcends all the United Charms of her whole Sex: ev'n thoſe Chymerical Perfections which the hyperbolical imaginations of Poets in Love have aſſign'd to their Miſtreſſes, ceaſe to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible Deſcriptions when apply'd to her, in whom all thoſe Miraculous Endowments are moſt divinely centred. The Curling Locks of her bright flowing Hair are pureſt Gold; her ſmooth Forehead the <hi>Elyſian</hi> Plain; her Brows are two Celeſtial Bows; her Eyes two Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Suns; her Cheeks two beds of Roſes; her Lips are Coral, and her Teeth are Pearl: her Neck is Alablaſter; her Breaſts Marble; her Hands Ivory; and Snow wou'd loſe its white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs near her Boſom. Then for the parts which Modeſty has veil'd, my imagination, not to wrong 'em, chuſes to loſe it ſelf in ſilent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:54446:74"/>
for Nature boaſts nothing that may give an Idea of their incomparable worth. Pray, Sir, cry'd <hi>Vivaldo,</hi> oblige us with an account of her Parentage, and the place of her Birth, to compleat the Deſcription. Sir, reply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> ſhe is not deſcended from the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Curtius's, Caius's,</hi> nor <hi>Scipio's</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> nor from the more Modern <hi>Colonna</hi>'s, nor <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni's;</hi> nor from the <hi>Moncada's</hi> and <hi>Requeſens's</hi> of <hi>Catalonia;</hi> nor from the <hi>Rebilla's,</hi> and <hi>Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nova's</hi> of <hi>Valencia;</hi> nor from the <hi>Palafoxes, Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas, Rocaberti's, Coreillas, Lunas, Alagones, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas, Foze's,</hi> or <hi>Gurrea's</hi> of <hi>Arragon;</hi> nor from the <hi>Cerda's, Manriquez, Mendoca's,</hi> and <hi>Guſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's</hi> of <hi>Caſtile;</hi> nor from the <hi>Alencaſtros, Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> and <hi>Menezes</hi> of <hi>Portugal;</hi> but ſhe derives her great original from the Family of <hi>Toboſo</hi> in <hi>La Mancha,</hi> a Race, which, tho it be Modern, is ſufficient to give a noble Beginning to the moſt illuſtrious Progenies of ſucceeding Ages. And let no man preſume to contradict me in this, unleſs it be upon thoſe conditions, which <hi>Zerbin</hi> fixt at the Foot of <hi>Orlando</hi>'s Armour;

                                 <l>Let none but he theſe Arms diſplace,</l>

                              </q>
I draw my Pedigree from the <hi>Cachopines</hi> of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redo,</hi> reply'd <hi>Vivaldo,</hi> yet I dare not make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Compariſons with the <hi>Toboſo's</hi> of <hi>La Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha,</hi> tho, to deal ſincerely with you, 'tis a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily that I never heard of till this moment. 'Tis ſtrange, ſaid <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> you ſhou'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have heard of it before.</p>
                           <p>All the reſt of the Company gave great atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this Diſcourſe; and even the very Goat-herds
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:54446:74"/>
were nowfully convinc'd that <hi>Don Quixote</hi>'s Brains were turn'd topſy turvy. But <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> believ'd every word that dropt from his Maſters mouth to be Truth, as having known him from his Cradle to be a Man of Sincerity. Yet that which ſomewhat ſtagger'd his Faith, was this ſtory of <hi>Dulcinea</hi> of <hi>Toboſo;</hi> for he was ſure he had never heard before of any ſuch Princeſs, nor even of the Name, tho he liv'd hard by <hi>Toboſo.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>As they went on thus diſcourſing, they ſaw, upon the hollow Road between the two neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Mountains, about twenty Shepherds more, all accoutred in Black Skins, with Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands on their Heads, which; as they afterwards perceiv'd, were all of Ewe and Cyprus. Six of 'em carried a <hi>Bier,</hi> cover'd with ſeveral ſorts of Boughs and Flowers: Which one of the Goat-herds eſpying, Theſe are they, cry'd he, that are carrying poor <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> to his Grave: and twas in yonder Bottom that he gave charge they ſhou'd bury his Corps. This made 'em all double their pace, that they might get thither in time; and ſo they arriv'd juſt as the Bearers had ſet down the <hi>Bier</hi> upon the ground, and four of 'em had began to open the ground with their Spades, juſt at the foot of a Rock. They all ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted each other courteouſly, and condol'd their mutual loſs, and then <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> with thoſe who came with him, went to view the <hi>Bier,</hi> where they ſaw the Dead Body of a young man in Shepherds weeds, all ſtrew'd over with Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. The Deceaſed ſeem'd to be about 30 years old, and dead as he was, 'twas eaſily perceiv'd that both his Face and Shape were extraordinary handſome.

                              </gap>hin the <hi>Bier</hi> were ſome few Books, and ſeveral Papers, ſome open, and the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54446:75"/>
reſt folded up. This doleful object ſo ſtrangely fill'd all the Company with ſadneſs, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Beholders, but alſo the Grave-makers and all the Mourning Shepherds remain'd a long time ſilent; till at laſt, one of the Bearers, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing himſelf to one of the reſt; Look, <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi> cry'd he, whether this be the place which <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> meant, ſince you muſt needs have his Will ſo punctually perform'd. This is the very place, anſwer'd the other: There it was that my unhappy Friend many times told me the ſad ſtory of his cruel Fortune; There it was that he firſt ſaw that mortal Enemy of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; There it was that he made the firſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of his Paſſion, no leſs innocent than vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; There it was that the relentleſs <hi>Marcella</hi> laſt deny'd, ſhunn'd him, and drove him to that extremity of Sorrow and Deſpair, that haſten'd the ſad Cataſtrophe of his Tragical and Miſerable Life; and There it was, that, in token of ſo many Misfortunes, he deſir'd to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Bowels of eternal Oblivion.</p>
                           <p>Then, addreſſing himſelf to <hi>Don Quixote</hi> and the reſt of the Travellers, This Body, Sirs, ſaid he, which here you now behold, was once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liven'd by a Soul, which Heaven had enrich'd with the greateſt part of its moſt wealthy Graces. This is the Body of that <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> who was unrivall'd in Wit, matchleſs in Courteouſneſs, incomparable in Gracefulneſs, a Phaenix in Friendſhip, Generous and Magnificent without Oſtentation, Prudent and Grave without Pride, Modeſt without Affectation, Pleaſing and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant without Meanneſs. In a word, the firſt in every eſteemable Qualification, and ſecond to none in Misfortune: He lov'd well, and was
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:54446:75"/>
hated; he ador'd, and was diſdain'd; he begg'd Pity of Cruelty itſelf; he ſtrove to move ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate Marble; purſu'd the Wind; made his moans to ſolitary Deſarts; was conſtant to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, and for the Recompence of his Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity became a prey to Death in the Flower of his Age, thro the barbarity of a Sheperdeſs whom he ſtrove to immortalize by his Verſe, as theſe Papers which are here depoſited might teſtify, had he not commanded me to ſacrifice 'em to the Flames, at the ſame time that his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was committed to the Earth.</p>
                           <p>Shou'd you do ſo, cry'd <hi>Vivaldo,</hi> you wou'd appear more cruel to 'em than their exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unhappy Parent. Conſider, Sir, 'tis not conſiſtent with Diſcretion, nor even with Juſtice, ſo nicely to perform the Requeſt of the Dead, when 'tis repugnant with Reaſon. <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> himſelf wou'd have forfeited his Title to Wiſdom, had he permitted that to have been effected which the Divine <hi>Virgil</hi> had order'd by his Will. Therefore, Sir, now that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign your Friends Body to the Grave, do not hurry thus the noble and only Remains of that dear unhappy man to a worſe Fate, the Death of Oblivion. What, tho he has doom'd 'em to periſh, in the height of his Reſentment, you ought not indiſcreetly to be their Executioner: But rather reprieve and redeem 'em from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſilence; that they may live, and flying thro the World tranſmit to all ages the diſmal ſtory of your Friends Virtue and <hi>Marcella</hi> s Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; as a warning to others that they may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void ſuch tempting Snares, and enchanting De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions. Therefore, in the name of all the company, like me, deeply affected with a ſenſe
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54446:76"/>
of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>'s extraordinary merit, and his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy fate, and deſirous to prevent ſuch deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable diſaſters for the future, I beg that you will permit me to ſave ſome of theſe Papers, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you reſolve to do with the reſt. And ſo, without expecting an anſwer, he ſtretch'd out his arm, and took out thoſe Papers which lay next to his hand. Well Sir, ſaid <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> you have found a way to make me ſubmit, and you may keep thoſe Papers; but for the reſt, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall make me alter my Reſolution of burning 'em. <hi>Vivaldo</hi> ſaid no more, but, being impatient to ſee what thoſe Papers were, which he had reſcu'd from the Flames, he open'd one of 'em immediately, and read the Title of it, which was <hi>The Deſpairing Lover.</hi> That, ſaid <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> was the firſt Piece my dear Friend ever wrote; and therefore, that you may all hear to what a ſad condition his unhappy Paſſion had reduc'd him, read it aloud, I beſeech you, Sir, while the Grave is making. With all my heart, reply'd <hi>Vivaldo.</hi> And ſo the Company, having the ſame Deſire, preſently gather'd round about him, and he read the following lines.</p>

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:54446:78"/>
prevented by a kind of an Apparition, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered it ſelf to their View. 'Twas <hi>Marcella</hi> herſelf, who appear'd at the top of the Rock, at the foot of which they were digging the Grave, but ſo beautiful, that Fame ſeem'd rather to have leſſen'd than to have magnify'd her Charms; thoſe who had never ſeen her before gaz'd on her with ſilent wonder and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; nay, thoſe who us'd to ſee her every day ſeem'd no leſs loſt in admiration than the reſt. But ſcarce had <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſpy'd her, when with anger and indignation in his heart, he cry'd out; What mak'ſt thou there, thou fierce, thou cruel Baſilisk of theſe Mountains? com'ſt thou to ſee whether the Wounds of this mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd Wretch will bleed afreſh at thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence? Or com'ſt thou thus mounted aloft, to glory in the fatal effects of thy native Inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, like another <hi>Nero</hi> at the ſight of Flaming <hi>Rome?</hi> Or is it to Trample this unfortunate Corps, as <hi>Tarquin</hi>'s ungrateful Daughter did her Fathers? Tell us quickly, why thou com'ſt, and what thou yet deſireſt? For ſince I know, that <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>'s whole ſtudy was to ſerve and pleaſe thee, while he liv'd, I'm wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to diſpoſe all his Friends to pay thee the like obedience, now he's dead. I come not here to any of thoſe ungrateful ends, <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd <hi>Marcella;</hi> but only to clear my Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and ſhow the injuſtice of all thoſe, who lay their misfortunes and <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>'s Death to my charge. Therefore, I entreat you all, who are here at this time, to hear me a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, for I ſhall not need to uſe many words, to convince People of ſenſe of an evident Truth. Heav'n, you're pleas'd to ſay, has made me
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:54446:78"/>
beautiful, and that to ſuch a degree, that you are forc'd, nay, as it were compell'd to love me, in ſpight of your endeavours to the contrary; and for the ſake of that love, you ſay I ought to love you again. Now tho I am ſenſible that whatever is beautiful is lovely, I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that what is lov'd for being handſom, ſhou'd be bound to love that by which 'tis lov'd, meerly becauſe 'tis lov'd; he that loves a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful object may happen to be ugly, and as what is ugly deſerves not to be lov'd, it wou'd be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous to ſay, I love you becauſe you are handſom, and therefore you muſt love me again, tho I am ugly. But ſuppoſe two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of different Sex are equally handſom, it does not follow, that their deſires ſhou'd be alike and reciprocal; for all Beauties do not kindle Love; ſome only recreate the ſight, and never reach nor captivate the heart. Alas, ſhou'd whatever is beautiful beget Love and in ſlave the mind, Mankind's deſires wou'd ever run confus'd and wandering, without being able to fix their determinate choice; for as there is an infinite number of beautiful objects, the Deſires wou'd conſequently be alſo infinite; whereas, on the contrary, I have heard that true Love is ſtill confin'd to one, and voluntary and unforc'd. This being granted, why wou'd you have me force my Inclinations, for no other reaſon but that you ſay you love me? Tell me, I beſeech you, had Heaven form'd me as ugly as it has made me beautiful, cou'd I juſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of you for not loving me? Pray conſider alſo that I do not poſſeſs thoſe Charms by choice; ſuch as they are, they were freely beſtow'd on me by Heaven; and as the Viper is not to be
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:54446:79"/>
blam'd for the Poyſon with which ſhe kills, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'twas aſſign'd her by Nature, ſo I ought not to be cenſur'd for that Beauty which I derive from the ſame Cauſe. For Beauty in a Virtuous Woman is but like a diſtant Flame, or a ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edg'd Sword, and only burns and wounds thoſe who approach too near it. Honour and Virtue are the ornaments of the Soul, and that Body that's deſtitute of 'em cannot be eſteem'd beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, tho it be naturally ſo. If then Honour be one of thoſe Endowments which moſt adorn the Body, why ſhou'd ſhe that's belov'd for her Beauty, expoſe herſelf to the loſs of it, meerly to gratifie the looſe Deſires of one, who for his own ſelfiſh ends uſes all the means imaginable to make her loſe it? I was born free, and that I might continue ſo, I retir'd to theſe ſolitary hills and plains, where Trees are my Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and clear Fountains my Looking-glaſſes. Thoſe whom I have attracted with my ſight, I have undeceiv'd with my words. And if hope be the food of deſire, I never gave any encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> nor to any other; it may well be ſaid, 'twas rather his own obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy than my cruelty that ſhorten'd his life. If you tell me, that his intentions were honeſt, and therefore ought to have been complyd with, I anſwer, that when, at the very place where his Grave is making, he diſcover'd his Paſſion, I told him I was reſolv'd to live and dye ſingle, and that the Earth alone ſhou'd reap the ſpoils of my Reſerv'dneſs and Beauty; and if after all the admonitions I gave him, he wou'd perſiſt in his obſtinate purſuit, and ſail againſt the Wind, what wonder is't he ſhou'd periſh in the Waves of his Indiſcretion? had I ever encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:54446:79"/>
him, or amus'd him with ambiguous words, then I had been falſe; and had I grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd his wiſhes, I had acted contrary to my bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reſolves. He perſiſted, tho I had given him a due caution, and he deſpair'd e're he was ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Now I leave you to judge whether I ought to be blam'd for his ſufferings? If I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd any one, let him complain. If I have broke my promiſe to any one, let him deſpair. If I encourage any one, let him preſume. If I entertain any one, let him boaſt. But let no man call me cruel nor murtherer, till I either deceive, break my promiſe, encourage, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain him. Heaven has not yet been pleas'd to ſhew whether 'tis its will I ſhou'd love by deſtiny; and 'tis vain to think I will ever do it by choice. So let this general caution ſerve e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of thoſe who make their addreſſes to me for private ends. And if any one hereafter dyes on my account, let not their Jealouſy, nor my Scorn or Hate be thought the cauſe of their death; for ſhe who never pretended to love cannot make any one jealous, and a free and generous Declaration of our fix'd Reſolution, ought not to be accounted hate nor diſdain. In ſhort, let him that calls me a Tygreſs and a Baſilisk, avoid me as a dangerous Thing; and let him that calls me ungrateful, give over ſerving me; I aſſure 'em I will never ſeek nor purſue 'em. Therefore let none hereafter make it their buſineſs to diſturb my eaſe, nor ſtrive to make me ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                           <p>However, ſo prevalent were the Charms of the latter, that ſome of the Company, who were deſperately ſtruck, cou'd not forbear of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to follow her, without being the leaſt deterr'd by the ſolemn Proteſtations, which they had heard her make that very moment. But <hi>Don Quixote</hi> perceiving their deſign, and believing he had now a fit opportunity to exert his Knight-Errantry, Let no man, cry'd he, of what Quality or Condition ſoever, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to follow the fair <hi>Marcella,</hi> under the penalty of incurring my furious indignation. She has made it appear by undeniable Reaſons, that ſhe was not guilty of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>'s Death, and has poſitively declar'd her firm reſolution, never to condeſcend to the deſires of any of her Admirers. For which reaſon, inſtead of being importun'd and perſecuted, ſhe ought to be eſteem'd and honour d by all good men; as being perhaps the only Woman in the World, that ever liv'd with ſuch a Virtuous Reſerv'd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.

he and his Squire went after <hi>Marcella</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Wood; and having rang'd it above two hours, without being able to find her, they came at laſt to a Meadow, whoſe ſpringing Green, water'd with a delightful and refreſhing Rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, invited, or rather pleaſingly forc'd em to alight, and give way to the heat of the day, which began to be very violent. So leaving the Aſs and <hi>Rozinante</hi> to graze at large, they ranſackt the Wallet, and without Ceremony the Maſter and the Man fell to, and fed lovingly on what they found. Now <hi>Sancho</hi> had not taken care to tye up <hi>Rozinante,</hi> knowing him to be a Horſe of that Sobriety and Chaſtity, that all the Mares in the Paſtures of <hi>Cordona</hi> cou'd not have rais'd him to attempt an indecent thing. But either Fortune, or the Devil, who ſeldom ſleeps, ſo order'd it, that a good number of <hi>Galician</hi> Mares, belonging to ſome <hi>Yangueſian</hi> Carriers, were then feeding in the ſame Valley, it being the cuſtom of thoſe Men about the hotteſt time of the day to ſtop where-ever they meet with Graſs and Water to refreſh their Horſes. Nor cou'd they have found a fitter place than that where <hi>Don Quixote</hi> was. <hi>Rozinante,</hi> as I ſaid before, was chaſte and modeſt, however he was fleſh and blood; ſo that aſſoon as he had ſmelt the Mares, forſaking his natural Gravity and Reſerv'dneſs, without asking his Maſters leave, away he trots it briskly to make 'em ſenſible of his little neceſſities: But they, who, it ſeems, had more mind to feed than to be merry, receiv'd their Gallant ſo rudely with their heels and teeth, that in a trice they broke his Girts, and threw down his Saddle, and left him diſrob'd of

                              <hi>Don Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho,</hi> perceiving at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance the ill uſage of <hi>Rozinante,</hi> ran with all ſpeed to his Reſcue; and as they came near the place, panting, and almoſt out of breath, Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> cry'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> I perceive theſe are no Knights, but only a pack of Scoundrels, and Fellows of the loweſt Rank, I ſay it, becauſe thus thou mayſt lawfully help me, to revenge the Injury they have done <hi>Rozinante</hi> before our faces. What a Devil d'ye talk of Revenge, quoth <hi>Sancho?</hi> We are like to revenge our ſelves finely! You ſee they are above twenty, and we are but two, nay, perhaps but one and a half. I alone am worth a hundred, reply'd <hi>Don Quixote;</hi> then without any more words, he drew his Sword, and flew upon the <hi>Yangueſians. Sancho,</hi> encourag'd by his Maſters example, did the like, and with the firſt blow, which <hi>Don Quixote</hi> gave one of 'em, he cut thro his Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Doublet, and gave him a deep ſlaſh in the Shoulder. The <hi>Yangueſians,</hi> ſeeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thus rudely handled, betook themſelves to their Leavers and Pack-Staves, and then all at once ſurrounding the valiant Knight and his truſty Squire, they charg'd 'em, and laid on with great fury. At the ſecond round down they ſettle poor <hi>Sancho,</hi> and then <hi>Don Quixote</hi> himſelf, who, as Chance wou'd have it, fell at the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:54446:84"/>
feet of <hi>Rozinante,</hi> who had not yet recover'd his Legs; neither cou'd the Knights Courage nor his Skill avail againſt the fury of a number of ruſtical fellows, arm'd with Pack-ſtaves. The <hi>Yangueſians,</hi> fearing the ill conſequences of the miſchief they had done, made all the haſte they cou'd to be gone, leaving our two Adventurers in a woful condition. The firſt that came to himſelf was <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> who finding himſelf near his Maſter, call'd to him thus, with a weak and doleful voice, Ah Maſter! Maſter! Sir, Sir Knight! What's the matter, Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> ask'd the Knight, in the ſame feeble and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting tone? I cou'd wiſh, reply'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> that your Worſhip wou'd help me to two good Draughts of the Liquor you talk on, if you have any by you, perhaps 'tis as good to cure broken Bones, as 'tis to heal outward wounds. Oh! that I had ſome of it here now, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> we cou'd not then be ſaid to want any thing: But I ſwear to thee, honeſt <hi>Sancho,</hi> by the Faith of a Knight-Errant, within theſe two days (if no other Diſaſter prevent me) I will have ſome at my diſpoſal, or it ſhall hardly eſcape my hands. Two Days, Sir, reply'd <hi>Sancho!</hi> Why, pray how many Days do you think 'twill be before we are able to ſtir our Feet? As for my ſelf, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd the bruis'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> I muſt own I I cannot ſet a certain term to the days of our Recovery; but 'tis I, who am the fatal cauſe of all this miſchief, for I ought not to have drawn my Sword againſt a Company of Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, upon whom the honour of Knighthood was never conferr'd, and I do not doubt but that Providence ſuffer'd this Puniſhment to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:54446:84"/>
me, for tranſgreſſing thus the Laws of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry: therefore, Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> obſerve what I am going to tell thee, for it is a thing that highly concerns the welfare of us both, 'tis, that for the future whenever thou perceiv'ſt us to be any ways abus'd by ſuch inferiour fellows, thou art not to expect I ſhou'd offer to draw my Sword againſt them; for I will not do it in the leaſt: No, do thou then draw, and chaſtiſe 'em as thou thinkſt fit: But if any Knights come to take their parts, then will I be ſure to ſtep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thee and Danger, and aſſault em with the utmoſt Vigour and Intrepidity. Thou haſt already had a thouſand Proofs of the greatneſs of my Valour, and the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrength of my moſt dreadful Arm: (So arrogant the Knight was grown, ſince his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over the bold <hi>Biſcayan.</hi>) But <hi>Sancho</hi> was not ſo well pleas'd with his Maſters admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but that he thought fit to anſwer him: Sir, ſays he, I am a peaceful man, a harmleſs quiet fellow, d'ye ſee: I can make ſhift to paſs by an Injury as well as any man, as having a Wife to maintain, and Children to bring up; and therefore pray take this from me, by the way of Advice, (for I'll not offer to command my Maſter) that I will not in any wiſe draw my Sword, neither againſt Knight nor Clown, not I. I freely forgive all mankind, High and Low, Rich and Poor, Lords and Beggars, whatever wrongs they ever did, or may do me, without the leaſt exception. <hi>Sancho,</hi> (ſaid his Maſter, hearing this) I heartily wiſh I had Breath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to anſwer thee effectually, or that the pain which I feel in one of my ſhort Ribs wou'd leave
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:54446:85"/>
me but for ſo long as might ſerve to convince thee of thy error. Come, ſuppoſe, thou ſilly wretch, that the gale of Fortune, which has hitherto been ſo contrary to us, ſhou'd at laſt turn favourable, ſwelling the Sails of our Deſires, ſo that we might with as much ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as eaſe, arrive at ſome of thoſe Iſlands which I have promis'd thee: What wou'd become of thee, if, after I had conquer'd one of 'em, I were to make thee Lord of it? Thou wou'dſt certainly be found not duly qualifi'd for that Dignity, as having abjur'd all Knighthood, all thoughts of Honour, and all Intention to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge Injuries, and defend thy own Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For thou muſt underſtand, that to King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Provinces newly conquer'd, the hearts and minds of the Inhabitants are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo thoroughly ſubdu'd or wedded to the Intereſts of their new Soveraign, but that there is reaſon to fear, they will endeavour to raiſe ſome Commotions to change the face of affairs, and, as men ſay, once more try their Fortune. Therefore tis neceſſary that the new Poſſeſſor have not only Underſtanding to govern, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Valour to attack his Enemies, and defend himſelf on all occaſions. I wou'd I had had that Underſtanding and Valour you talk of, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> but now, Sir, I muſt be free to tell you, I have more need of a Surgeon, than of a Preacher. Pray try whether you can riſe, and we'll help <hi>Rozinante,</hi> tho he does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, for he's the chief cauſe of all this Beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For my part, I cou'd never have believ'd the like of him before, for I always took him for as ſober and peaceable a perſon as my ſelf.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:54446:85"/>
In ſhort, 'tis a true ſaying, that <hi>a man muſt eat a peck of Salt with his Friend, before he knows him;</hi> and I find <hi>There's nothing ſure in this World.</hi> For, who wou'd have thought, after the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſlaſhes you gave to that Knight-Errant, ſuch a terrible Tempeſt of Baſtinadoes wou'd ſo ſoon have ſhowr'd upon our Shoulders? As for thine, reply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> I doubt they are us'd to endure ſuch ſort of ſhowers; but mine, that were nurſt in ſoft Linnen, will moſt certainly be longer ſenſible of this Misfortune; and were it not that I imagine (bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I beſeech you, Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſince theſe Rubs are ſometimes the Vails of your Trade of Knighthood, tell me whether they uſe to be very brief among you, or whether we may look for 'em at ſet times; for, I fancy, if we meet but with two ſuch Harveſts m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Know, Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> return'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> that the Life of Knights-Errant is ſubject to a thouſand Hazards and Misfortunes: But, on the other ſide, they may at any time ſuddenly become Kings and Emperors, as experience has demonſtrated in many Knights, of whoſe Hiſtories I have a perfect Knowledge. And I cou'd tell thee now (wou'd my pain ſuffer me) of ſome of 'em who have rais'd themſelves to thoſe high Dignities only by the ſtrength of their Arms; and thoſe very Knights, both before and after their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:54446:86"/>
were involv'd in many Calamities. For the valorous <hi>Amadis de Gaul</hi> ſaw himſelf in the Power of his mortal Enemy <hi>Arcalaus</hi> the Inchanter, of whom 'tis credibly reported that when he held him Priſoner he gave him above two hundred ſtripes with his Horſe Bridle, after he had ty'd him to a Pillar in the Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard of his houſe. There is alſo a ſecret Author of no little credit, relates, That the Knight of the Sun being taken in a Trap in a certain Caſtle was hurri'd to a deep Dungeon, where, after they had bound him Hand and Foot, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly gave him a Glyſter of Snow-water and Sand, which wou'd probably have coſt him his Life, had he not been aſſiſted in that Diſtreſs by a wiſe Magician his particular Friend. Thus I may well bear my misfortune patiently, ſince thoſe which ſo many greater perſons have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd may be ſaid to out do it. For I wou'd have thee to know, that thoſe wounds which are given with the Inſtruments and Tools which a Man happens to have in his hand do not really diſgrace the Perſon ſtruck. We read it expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Laws of Duels, <hi>That if a Shoemaker ſtrikes another Man with his Laſt which he held in his hand, tho it be of Wood as a Cudgel is, yet the party who was ſtruck with it ſhall not be ſaid to have been cudgell d.</hi> I tell thee this, that thou mayſt not think we are in the leaſt diſhonored, tho we have been horribly beaten in this Rencoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for the weapons, which thoſe men us'd, were but the Inſtruments of their profeſſion, and not one of 'em, as I very well remember, had either Tuck, or Sword, or Dagger. They gave me no leiſure, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> to examine
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:54446:86"/>
things ſo narrowly; for I had no ſooner laid my hand on my Weapon, but they croſt my Shoulders with ſuch a Wooden Bleſſing, as ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled me on the ground without ſence or moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, where you ſee me lie; and where I don't trouble my head whether it be a Diſgrace to be mawl'd with Cudgels or with Pack-ſtaves: Let 'em be what they will, I am only vext to feel them ſo heavy on my Shoulders, where I am afraid they are imprinted as deep, as they are in my Mind. For all this, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> I muſt inform thee, Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> that there is no Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, which time will not deface, nor no Pain, to which Death will not put a Period. Thank you for nothing, quoth <hi>Sancho!</hi> What worſe can befall us, than to have only Death to truſt to? Were our affliction to be cur'd with a Plaiſter or two, a man might have ſome Patience; but, for ought I ſee, all the Salves in an Hoſpital won't ſet us on our beſt Legs again Come, no more of this, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote;</hi> take Courage, and make a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of neceſſity; for 'tis what I am reſolv'd to do.

But, Sir, cry'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> I have heard you ſay, that 'tis a common thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you Knight-Errants to ſleep in Fields and Deſarts the beſt part of the year, and that you look upon it to be a very happy kind of Life. That is to ſay, reply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> when we can do no better, or when we are in Love; and this is ſo true, that there have been Knights who have dwelt on Rocks, expos'd to the Sun, and other Inclemencies of the Sk, for the ſpace of two Years, without their Lady's Knowledge: One of thoſe was <hi>Amadis,</hi> when, aſſuming the Name of <hi>The Lovely Obſcure,</hi> he inhabited

the <hi>Poor Rock,</hi> either eight years, or eight months, I can't now punctually tell which of the two; for I don't thoroughly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that paſſage. Let it ſuffice that there he dwelt, doing Penance, for I don't know what unkindneſs his Lady <hi>Oriana</hi> had ſhew'd him. But ſetting theſe Diſcourſes aſide, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thee diſpatch, leſt ſome Miſchief befall thy Aſs, as it has done <hi>Rozinante.</hi> That wou'd be the Devil indeed, reply'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> and ſo breathing out ſome thirty Lamentations, threeſcore Sighs, and a hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Plagues and Poxes on thoſe that had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coy d him thither, he at laſt got upon his Legs, yet not ſo but that he went ſtoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with his Body bent like a <hi>Turks</hi> Bow, not being able to ſtand upright. Yet in this crooked Poſture he made a ſhift to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs his Aſs, who had not forgot to take his ſhare of Licentiouſneſs that day. After this, he help'd up <hi>Rozinante,</hi> who, cou'd his Tongue have expreſt his Sorrows, wou'd certainly not have been behindhand with <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> and his Maſter. After many bitter Oh's, and Screw'd Faces, <hi>Sancho</hi> laid <hi>Don Quixote</hi> on the Aſs, ty'd <hi>Rozinante</hi> to its Tail, and then leading the Aſs by the Halter, he took the neareſt way that he cou'd gueſs to the high Road; to which he luckily came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had travell'd a ſhort League, and then he diſcover'd an Inn; which, in ſpight of all he cou'd ſay, <hi>Don Quixote</hi> was pleas'd to miſtake for a Caſtle. <hi>Sancho</hi> ſwore bloodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 'twas an Inn, and his Maſter was as po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive of the contrary.

                           <p>THe Inn-keeper, ſeeing <hi>Don Quixote</hi> lying quite athwart the Aſs, ask'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> what ail'd him? <hi>Sancho</hi> anſwer'd, 'Twas nothing, only his Maſter had got a fall from the Top of a Rock to the Bottom, and had bruis'd his Sides a little. The Inn-keeper had a Wife, very different from the common ſort of Hoſteſſes, for ſhe was of a Charitable Nature, and very compaſſionate of her Neighbour's Afflictions; which made her immediately take Care of <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> and call her Daughter, (a good hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Girl,) to ſet her helping hand to his Cure. One of the Servants in the Inn was an <hi>Aſturian</hi> Wench, a Broad-fac'd, Flat-headed, Sadle-noſs'd, Dowdy; blind of one Eye, and t'other almoſt out: However, the Activity of her Body ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd all other Defects. She was not above three Foot high from her Heels to her Head; and her Shoulders, which ſomewhat loaded her, made her look downwards oftner than ſhe cou'd have wiſh'd. This charming Original like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe aſſiſted the Miſtreſs and the Daughter; and with the latter, help'd to make the Knight's Bed, and a ſorry one it was; the Room where it ſtood was an old gambling Cock-loft, which by manifold Signs ſeem'd to have been in the days
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:54446:89"/>
of <hi>Yore,</hi> a Repoſitory for chopt Straw. Some what further, in a Corner of that Garret, a Car<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rier had his Lodging; and tho' his Bed was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Pannels and Coverings of his Mules, 'twas much better than that of <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> which only conſiſted of four rough hewn Boards laid upon two uneven Treſſels, a Flock-bed, that, for Subſtance, might well have paſs'd for a Quilt, and was full of Knobs and Bunches, which had they not peep'd out thro' many a hole, and ſhewn themſelves to be of Wool, might well have been taken for Stones: The reſt of that extraordinary Bed's Furniture, was a pair of Sheets, which rather ſeem'd to be of Leather than of Linnen Cloath, and a Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let whoſe every individual Thread you might have told, and never have miſs'd one in the Tale.</p>

                           <p>Here <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> who had liſten'd with great Attention to all theſe Diſcourſes, rais'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up in his Bed with much ado, and taking the Hoſteſs, in a moſt obliging manner by the hand, Believe me, ſaid he, beautiful Lady, you may well eſteem it a Happineſs, that you have now the opportunity to entertain my Perſon in your Caſtle. Self-praiſe is unworthy a Man of Honour, and therefore I ſhall ſay no more of my ſelf; but my Squire will inform you who I am. Only thus much let me add, That I will eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally preſerve your Kindneſs in the Treaſury of my Remembrance, and ſtudy all Occaſions to teſtifie my Gratitude. And I wiſh, continu'd he, the Powers above had ſo diſpos'd my Fate, that I were not already Love's devoted Slave, and captivated by the Charms of the diſdainful Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who engroſſes all my ſofter Thoughts; for then wou'd I be proud to Sacrifice my Liberty to this beautiful Damſel. The Hoſteſs, her Daughter, and the kind-hearted <hi>Maritornes,</hi> ſtar'd on one another, quite at a loſs for the meaning of this high flown Language, which they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood full as well as if it had been <hi>Greek.</hi> Yet conceiving theſe were Words of Complement and Courtſhip, they look'd upon him and admir'd him as a Man of another World. And ſo, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made him ſuch Returns, as Inn-keeper's Breeding cou'd afford, they left him to his Reſt.

Beyond thoſe two Beds was that of the Carrier made, as we have ſaid, of the Pannels and Furniture of two of the beſt of twelve Mules which he kept, every one of 'em goodly Beaſts and in ſpecial good Caſe; for he was one of the richeſt Muleteers of <hi>Arevalo,</hi> as the Mooriſh Author of this Hiſtory relates, who makes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular mention of him, as having been acquainted with him, nay, ſome don't ſtick to ſay he was ſomewhat a-kin to him. However it be, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that <hi>Cid Mahamet Benengeli</hi> was a very exact Hiſtorian, ſince he takes care to give us an Account of Things that ſeem ſo inconſiderable and trivial. A Laudable Example which thoſe Hiſtorians ſhould follow who uſually relate Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſo conciſely, that they ſeem ſcarce to have dipp'd in 'em, and rather to have left the moſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Part of the Story drown'd in the bottom
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:54446:92"/>
of the Inkhorn, either through Neglect, Malice, or Ignorance. A thouſand Bleſſings then be given to the curious Author of <hi>Tablante de Rico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monte,</hi> and to that other indefatigable Sage that recorded the Atchievements of Count <hi>Tomillas;</hi> for they have deſcrib'd even the moſt minute and trifling Circumſtances with a ſingular preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But, to return to our Story, you muſt know that after the Carrier had dreſt his Mules and given 'em their Night's Provender, he laid him down on his hard Bed, expecting the moſt punctual <hi>Maritornes</hi>'s kind Viſit. By this Time, <hi>Sancho,</hi> duly greas'd and anointed, was crept into his S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>y, where he did all he could to ſleep, but his aking Ribs did all they could to prevent him. As for the Knight, whoſe Sides were in as bad Circumſtances as his Squire's, he lay with both his Eyes open like a Hare. And now was every Soul in the Inn gone to Bed, not ſo much as a Mouſe ſtirring in the Houſe, nor any Light to be ſeen, except that of a Lamp which hung in the middle of the Gate-way. This general Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ſetting <hi>Don Quixote</hi>'s Thoughts at work, offer'd to his Imagination one of the moſt abſurd Follies that ever crept into a diſtemper'd Brain from the Peruſal of Romantic Whimſies. Now he fancied himſelf to be in a famous Caſtle (for, as we have already ſaid, all the Inns which were honour'd with his Preſence, ſeem'd no leſs than Caſtles to him) and that the Inn-keeper's Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (conſequently Daughter to the Lord of the Caſtle) ſtrangely captivated with his graceful Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Gallantry, had promis'd him the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of her Embraces, as ſoon as her Father and Mother were gone to Reſt. This Chimera di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd him, as if it had been a real Truth.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54446:92"/>
So that he began to be mightily perplext, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on the Danger to which his Honour was expos'd. But at laſt his Vertue over-came the powerful Temptation, and he firmly reſolv'd not to be guilty of the leaſt Infidelity to his Lady <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo;</hi> tho' Queen <hi>Genever</hi> her ſelf, with her truſty Matron <hi>Quintaniona</hi> ſhould joyn to decoy him into the alluring Snare.</p>
                           <p>While theſe wild Imaginations work'd in his Brain, the gentle <hi>Maritornes</hi> was mindful of her Aſſignation, and with ſoft and wary Steps, bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot and in her Smock, ſtole into the Room, and felt about for her belov'd Carrier's Bed. But ſcarce had ſhe got to the Door, when <hi>Don Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote,</hi> whoſe Ears were on the ſcout, was ſenſible that ſomething was coming in; and therefore having rais'd himſelf in his Bed, ſore and wrapt up in Plaiſters, as he was, he ſtretch'd out his Arms to receive his fancy'd Damſel, and caught hold of <hi>Maritornes</hi> by the Wriſt, as ſhe was, with her Arms ſtretch'd, groping her way to her <hi>Paramour;</hi> he pull'd her to him, and made her ſit down by his Bed's-ſide, ſhe not daring to ſpeak a Word all the while: Now, as he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd her to be the Lord of the Caſtle's Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, her Smock, which was of the courceſt Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſe, ſeem'd to him of the fineſt Holland; and the Glaſs Beads about her Wriſt, precious Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ental Pearls; her Hair that was almoſt as rough as a Horſe's Main, he took to be ſoft flowing Threads of bright curling Gold; and her Breath, that had a ſtronger <hi>Hogo</hi> than ſtale Veniſon, was to him a grateful Compound of the moſt fragrant Perfumes of <hi>Arabia.</hi> In ſhort, his flattering Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination transform'd her into the likeneſs of thoſe
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:54446:93"/>
Romantic Beauties, one of whom, as he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd to have read, came to pay a private Viſit to a wounded Knight, with whom ſhe was deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately in Love; and the poor Gentleman's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Folly had ſo inſatuated his outward Senſe, that his Feeling and his Smell cou'd not in the leaſt undeceive him; and he thought he had no leſs than a balmy <hi>Venus</hi> in his Arms, while he hugg'd a fulſome Bundle of Deformities that wou'd have turn'd any Man's Stomach but a ſharp-ſet Carrier's. Therefore, claſping her ſtill cloſer, with a ſoft and amorous Whiſper, Oh! thou moſt lovely Temptation, cry'd he, Oh that I now might but pay a warm Acknowledgment for the mighty Bleſſing which your extravagant Goodneſs wou'd laviſh on me; yes, moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Charmer, I wou'd give an Empire to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe your more deſirable Embraces; but For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, Madam, Fortune, that Tyrant of my Life, that unrelenting Enemy to the truly Deſerving has maliciouſly hurry'd and rivetted me to this Bed, where I lie ſo bruis'd and macerated, that, tho' I were eager to gratifie your Deſires, I ſhould at this dear unhappy Minute be doom'd to Impotence: Nay, to that unlucky Bar, Fate has added a yet more invincible Obſtacle. I mean my plighted Faith to the unrivall'd <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo,</hi> the ſole Miſtreſs of my Wiſhes, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Sovereign of my Heart, Oh! did not this oppoſe my preſent Happineſs, I cou'd never be ſo dull and inſenſible a Knight as to loſe the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of this extraordinary Favour which you have now condeſcended to offer me.</p>
                           <p>Poor <hi>Maritornes</hi> all this while ſweated for Fear and Anxiety, to find her ſelf thus lock'd in the Knight's Arms; and without either underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:54446:93"/>
or willing to underſtand his florid Excuſes, ſhe did what ſhe cou'd to get from him, and ſheer off, without ſpeaking a word. On the other ſide, the Carrier, whoſe lewd Though<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>s kept him awake, having heard his truſty Lady when ſhe firſt came in, and liſten'd ever ſince to the Knight's Diſcourſe, began to be affraid that ſhe had made ſome other Aſſignation; and ſo without any more ado, he crept ſoftly to <hi>Don Quixote</hi>'s Bed, where he liſten'd a while to hear what wou'd be the end of all this Talk, which he cou'd not underſtand: But perceiving at laſt, by the ſtruggling of his faithful <hi>Maritornes,</hi> that 'twas none of her Fault, and that the Knight ſtrove to detain her againſt her Will, he cou'd by no means bear his Familiarity; and therefore taking it in mighty Dudgeon, he up with his Fiſt, and hit the diſaſtrous Knight ſuch a ſwinging blow on the Jaws, that his Face was all over Blood in a moment. And not ſatisfied with this, he got o' top of the Knight, and with his ſplay Feet betrampled him as if he had been treading a Hay-mow. With that the Bed, whoſe Foundations were none of the beſt, ſunk under the additional Load of the Carrier, and fell with ſuch a noiſe that it wak'd the Inn-keeper, who preſently ſuſpects it to be one of <hi>Maritornes</hi>'s nightly Skirmiſhes; and therefore having call'd her aloud, and finding that ſhe did not anſwer, he lighted a Lamp and made to the Place where he heard the Buſtle. The Wench, who heard him coming, knowing him to be of a paſſionate Nature, was ſcar'd out of her Wits, and fled for ſhelter to <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Stye, where he lay ſnoring to ſome Tune: There ſhe pig'd in, and ſlunk un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Coverlet, where ſhe lay ſnug, and truſs'd
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:54446:94"/>
up as round as an Egg. Preſently her Maſter came in, in a mighty heat. Where's this damn'd Whore, cry'd he: I dare ſay this is one of her Pranks. By this, <hi>Sancho</hi> awak'd; and feeling that unuſual Lump, which almoſt over-laid him, he took it to be the Night-Mare, and began to lay about him with his Fiſts, and thump'd the Wench ſo unmercifully, that at laſt Fleſh and Blood were no longer able to bear it; and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting the Danger ſhe was in, and her dearer Reputation, ſhe paid him back his Thumps as faſt as her Fiſts cou'd lay 'em on, and ſoon rous'd the drowſie Squire out of his Sluggiſhneſs, whether he wou'd or no. Who finding himſelf thus pammell'd, by he did not know who, he buſled up in his Neſt, and catching hold of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritornes,</hi> they began the moſt pleaſant Skirmiſh in the World. When the Carrier perceiving by the Light of the Inn-keeper's Lamp, the diſmal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that his dear Miſtreſs was in, preſently took her part; and, leaving the Knight whom he had more than ſufficiently maul'd, flew at the Squire, and paid him confoundedly. On the other hand, the Inn-keeper, who took the Wench to be the cauſe of all this hurly burly, cuff'd and kick'd, and kick'd and cuff'd her over and over again: And ſo there was a ſtrange Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication of Fiſticuffs and Drubbing. The Carrier pummell'd <hi>Sancho, Sancho</hi> maul'd the Wench, the Wench belabour'd the Squire, and the Inn-keeper thraſh'd her again: And all of 'em laid on with ſuch Expedition, that you wou'd have thought they had been affraid of loſing Time. But the beſt Jeſt was, that in the heat of the Fray, the Lamp went out; ſo that being now in the dark, they ply'd one another
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:54446:94"/>
at a Venture, they ſtruck and tore, all went to Rack, while Nails and Fiſts flew about without Mercy.</p>
                           <p>There happen'd to lodge that Night in the Inn one of the Officers belonging to that Society which they call the old holy Brotherhood of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo,</hi> whoſe chief Office is to look after Thieves and Robbers. Being wak'd with the heavy Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, he preſently jump'd out of his Bed, and with his ſhort Staff in one hand, and a Tin Box with his Commiſſion in't in the other, he grop'd out his way; and being enter'd the Room in the dark, cry'd out, I charge ye all to keep the Peace: I am an Officer of the holy Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. The firſt he pop'd his hand upon hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to be the poor batter'd Knight who lay upon his Back, at his full length, without any Feeling, upon the Ruins of his Bed. The Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, having caught him by the Beard, preſently cry'd out, I charge you to aid and aſſiſt me: But finding he cou'd not ſtir, tho' he grip'd him hard, he preſently imagin'd him to be dead, and murther'd by the reſt in the Room. With that, he bauld out, to have the Gates of the Inn ſhut. Here's a Man murther'd, cry'd he; look that no Body makes his Eſcape. Theſe Words ſtruck all the Combatants with ſuch a Terrour, that as ſoon as they reach'd their Ears they gave over, and left the Argument undecided. Away ſtole the Inn-keeper to his own Room, the Carrier to his Pannels, and the Wench to her Kennel; only the unfortunate Knight, and his as unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Squire, remain'd where they lay, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to ſtir, while the Officer, having let go <hi>Don Quixote</hi>'s Beard, went out for a Light; in order to apprehend the ſuppos'd Murtherers. But
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:54446:95"/>
the Inn-keeper having wiſely put out the Lamp in the Gateway, as he ſneak'd out of the Room, the Officer was oblig'd to repair to the Kitchen Chimney, where, with much ado, puffing and blowing a long while among the Embers, he at laſt made ſhift to get a Light.</p>

                              <hi>DOn Quixote,</hi> who by this Time was come to himſelf, began to call <hi>Sancho</hi> with the ſame lamentable Tone as the Day before when he had been beaten by the Carriers in the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. <hi>Sancho,</hi> cry'd he, Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> art thou aſleep? Art thou aſleep, Friend <hi>Sancho?</hi> Sleep, reply'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> mightily out of Humour, may Old Nick rock my Cradle then. Why, how the Devil ſhould I ſleep, when all the Imps of Hell have been tormenting me to Night? Nay, thou'rt in the right, anſwer'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> for either I have no Skill in theſe Matters, or this Caſtle is enchanted. Hear what I ſay to thee, but firſt ſwear, thou will't never reveal it till after my Death. I ſwear it, quoth <hi>Sancho.</hi> I am thus cautious, ſaid <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> becauſe I hate to take away the Reputation of any Perſon. Why, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I tell you again, I ſwear ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to ſpeak a word of the Matter while you live; and I wiſh I may be at liberty to talk on't to Morrow. How, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote!</hi> Have I done thee ſo much wrong, <hi>Sancho,</hi> that thou would'ſt have me die ſo ſoon? Nay, 'tis not for
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:54446:96"/>
that neither, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> but becauſe I can't abide to keep things long, for fear they ſhou'd grow mouldy. Well, let it be for what thou pleaſeſt, ſaid <hi>Don Quixote:</hi> For I dare truſt greater Concerns to thy Courteſie and Affection. In ſhort, I know, that this very Night there has happen'd to me one of the ſtrangeſt Adventures that can be imagin'd; for, the Daughter of the Lord of this Caſtle came to me, who is one of the moſt engaging and moſt beautiful Damſels that ever Nature has been proud to boaſt of: What cou'd I not tell thee of the Charms of her Shape and Face, and the Perfections of her Mind! What cou'd I not add of other hidden Beauties, which I condemn to Silence and Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion, leſt I endanger my Allegiance and Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to my Lady <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo!</hi> I will only tell thee, That the Heavens envying the ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Happineſs which Fortune had thrown into my Hands; or rather, becauſe this Caſtle is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted, it happen'd, that in the midſt of the moſt tender and paſſionate Diſcourſes that paſt between us, the prophane Hand of ſome mighty Giant, which I cou'd not ſee, nor imagine whence it came, hit me ſuch a dreadful Blow on the Jaws, that they are ſtill embru'd with Blood; after which the diſcourteous Wretch preſuming on my preſent Weakneſs, did ſo barbarouſly bruiſe me, that I feel my ſelf in a worſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition now than I did Yeſterday, after the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers had ſo roughly handled me for <hi>Rozinante</hi>'s Incontinency: From which I conjecture, that the Treaſure of this Damſel's Beauty is guarded by ſome enchanted <hi>Moor,</hi> and not reſerv'd for me.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="139" facs="tcp:54446:96"/>Nor for me neither, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> for I have been Rib-roaſted by above Four Hundred <hi>Moors,</hi> who have hammer'd my Bones in ſuch guiſe, that I may ſafely ſay, the Aſſault and Battery made on my Body by the Carrier's Poles and Pack-ſtaves, were but ticklings and ſtroakings with a Feather to this. But, Sir, pray tell me, d'ye call this ſuch a pleaſant Adventure, when we are ſo lamentably pounded after it? And yet your hap may well be accounted better than mine, ſeeing you've hugg'd that fair Maiden in your Arms. But I, what have I had, I pray you, but the heavieſt Blows that e're fell on a poor Man's Shoulders? Woe's me and the Mother that bore me, for I neither am nor ever mean to be a Knight-Errant, and yet the elder Brother's Portion of Miſchiefs falls ſtill to my Lot. What, haſt thou been beaten as well as I, ſaid <hi>Don Quixote?</hi> What a Plague, cry'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> han't I been telling you ſo all this while? Come, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver let it trouble thee, Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> reply'd <hi>Don Quixote;</hi> for I'll immediately make the precious Balſam that will cure thee in the twinkling of an Eye.</p>
                           <p>By this time the Officer, having lighted his Lamp, came into the Room, to ſee who it was that was Murther'd: <hi>Sancho</hi> ſeeing him enter in his Shirt, a Napkin wrapt about his Head like a Turbant, and the Lamp in his hand, he being alſo an ugly ill-look'd Fellow; Sir, quoth the Squire to his Maſter, pray ſee whether this be not the enchanted <hi>Moor</hi> that's come again to have t'other Bout with me, and try whether he has not left ſome place unbruis'd for him now to maul as much as the reſt? It cannot be the <hi>Moor,</hi> reply'd <hi>Don Quixote:</hi> For Negromancers

never ſuffer themſelves to be ſeen. If they don't ſuffer themſelves to be ſeen, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> at leaſt they ſuffer themſelves to be felt: If not, let my Carcaſs bear witneſs.

                              <hi>Sancho</hi> then got up as faſt as his aking Bones wou'd let him, and with much ado made ſhift to crawl out of the Room to look for the Inn-keeper, and ſtumbling by the way on the Officer who ſtood hearkning to know what Miſchief he had done; Sir, quoth he to him, for Heav'ns ſake do ſo much as help us to a little Oil, Salt, Wine and Roſemary, to make a Med'cine for one of the beſt Knights-Errant that e're trod on Shoe of Leather, who lies yonder grievouſly wounded by the enchanted <hi>Moor</hi> of this Inn. The Officer hearing him talk at that Rate, took him to be out of his Wits; and it beginning to be Day Light, he open'd the Inn Door, and told the Inn-keeper what <hi>Sancho</hi> wanted. The Hoſt preſently provided the deſired Ingredients, and <hi>Sancho</hi> crept back with 'em to his Maſter, whom he found holding his Head, and ſadly complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Pain which he felt there; tho' after all, the Lamp had done him no more harm than only the raiſing of two huge Bumps; for that which he fancy'd to be Blood, was only Sweat and the Oil of the Lamp that had liquor'd his Hair and Face.</p>
                           <p>The Knight took all the Ingredients, and having mix'd 'em together, he had 'em ſet o're the Fire, and there kept 'em boiling till he thought they were enough. That done, he ask'd for a Viol to put this precious Liquor in. But there being none to be got, the Inn-keeper pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:54446:98"/>
him with an old earthen Jug, and <hi>Don Quixote</hi> was forc'd to be contented with that. Then he mumbled over the Pot above fourſcore <hi>Pater-noſter's,</hi> and as many <hi>Ave-Maria's, Salve-Regina's,</hi> and <hi>Creedo's,</hi> making the Sign of the Croſs at every Word by way of Benediction. At which Ceremony, <hi>Sancho,</hi> the Inn-keeper, and the Officer were preſent; for, as for the Carrier, he was gone to look after his Mules, and took no manner of Notice of what was paſt. This bleſſed Medicine being made, <hi>Don Quixote</hi> reſolv'd to make an immediate Experiment of it on himſelf, and to that purpoſe he took off a good Draught of the overplus which his Jug wou'd not hold. But he had ſcarce gulp'd it down, when it ſet him a Vomiting ſo violently, that you wou'd have thought he'd have caſt up his Heart, Liver, and Guts: And his reaching and ſtraining put him into ſuch a Sweat, that he deſir'd to be cover'd up warm, and left to his Repoſe. With that they left him, and he ſlept three whole Hours, and then waking, found himſelf ſo wonderfully eas'd, that he made no queſtion but he had now the right Balſam of <hi>Fierabraſs;</hi> and therefore he thought he might ſafely undertake all the moſt dangerous Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the World, without the leaſt hazard of his Perſon.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Sancho</hi> encourag'd by the wonderful Effect of the Balſam on his Maſter, begg'd that he wou'd be pleas'd to give him leave to ſip up what was left in the Pot, which was no ſmall Quantity; and the <hi>Don</hi> having conſented, honeſt <hi>Sancho</hi> lifted it up with both his Hands, and with a ſtrong Faith, and better Will, pour'd every drop down his Throat. Now the Man's Stomach
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:54446:98"/>
not being ſo nice as his Maſter's, the Drench did not ſet him a Vomiting after that manner; but caus'd ſuch a wambling in his Stomach, ſuch a bitter loathing, kecking and reaching, and ſuch grinding Pangs, with cold Sweats and Swoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that he verily believ'd his laſt Hour was come, and in the midſt of his Agony gave both the Balſam and him that made it to the Devil. Friend, ſaid <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> ſeeing him in that ſad Condition, I begin to think all this Pain befalls thee only becauſe thou haſt not receiv'd the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Knighthood; for 'tis my Opinion, this Balſam ought to be us'd by no Man that is not a profeſs'd Knight. What a plague did you mean then, by letting me drink it, quoth <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho?</hi> A Murrain on me and all my Generation, why did you not tell me this before? At length the Doſe began to Work to ſome purpoſe, and forc'd its way at both Ends, ſo copiouſly, that both his Bed-Mat and Coverlet were ſoon made unfit for any further uſe; and all the while he ſtrain'd ſo hard, that not only himſelf but the ſtanders-by thought he wou'd have dy'd. This dreadful Hurricane laſted about two Hours; and then too, inſtead of finding himſelf as free from Pain as his Maſter, he felt himſelf ſo fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſo far ſpent, that he was not able to ſtand.</p>
                           <p>But <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> as we've ſaid, found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in an excellent Temper; and his active Soul loathing an inglorious Repoſe, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently was impatient to depart to perform the Duties of his adventurous Profeſſion. For he thought thoſe Moments that were trifled away in Amuſements or other Concerns, only a Blank in Life; and all Delays, a depriving diſtreſs'd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:54446:99"/>
and the World in general, of his needed Aſſiſtance. The Confidence which he repos'd in his Balſam, heighten'd if poſſible his Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and thus carried away by his eager Thoughts, he ſadled <hi>Rozinante</hi> himſelf, and then put the Pannel upon the Aſs, and his Squire upon the Pannel, after he had help'd him to huddle on his Cloths. That done he mounted his Steed, and having ſpy'd a Javelin that ſtood in a Corner, he ſiez'd and appropriated it to himſelf to ſupply the want of his Lance; above twenty People that were in the Inn ſtood Spectators of all theſe Tranſactions, and among the reſt the Inn-keeper's Daughter, from whom <hi>Don Quixote</hi> had not Power to withdraw his Eyes; breathing out at every Glance a deep Sigh from the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of his Heart; which thoſe who had ſeen him ſo mortify'd the Night before, took to proceed from the Pain of his Bruiſes.</p>
                           <p>And now being ready to ſet forwards, he call'd for the Maſter of the Houſe, and with a grave Delivery, my Lord Governor, cry'd he, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours I have received in your Caſtle are ſo great and extraordinary, that they bind my grateful Soul to an eternal Acknowledgment. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that I may be ſo happy as to diſcharge part of the Obligation, think if there be e're a proud Mortal Breathing, on whom you deſire to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd for ſome Affront or other Injury; and acquaint me with it now, and by my Order of Knighthood, which binds me to protect the Weak, relieve the Oppreſſed, and puniſh the Bad, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe you I'll take effectual Care that you ſhall have ample Satisfaction, to the utmoſt of your Wiſhes. Sir Knight, anſwer'd the Inn-keeper with as au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere a Gravity, I ſhall not need your aſſiſtance to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:54446:99"/>
revenge any Wrong that may have been offer'd to my Perſon; for I wou'd have you to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that I am able to do my ſelf Juſtice when ever any Man preſumes to do me Wrong. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the Satisfaction I deſire, is, That you wou'd pay your Reckoning for Horſe-Meat and Man's-Meat, and all your Expences in my Inn. How! cry'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> is this an Inn? Yes, anſwer'd the Hoſt, and one of the moſt noted and of the beſt Repute upon the Road. How ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have I been miſtaken then, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote!</hi> Upon my Honour I took it for a Caſtle, and a conſiderable one too. But if it be an Inn, and not a Caſtle, all I have to ſay, is, That you muſt excuſe me from paying any Thing; for I wou'd by no means break the Laws which we Knights-Errant are bound to obſerve. Nor was it ever known that they ever paid in any Inn whatſoever. For this is the leaſt Recompence that can be allow'd 'em for the intolerable La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours they endure Day and Night, Winter and Summer, o' Foot and o' Horſeback, pinch'd with Hunger, choak'd with Thirſt, and expos'd to all the Injuries of the Air, and all the Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in the World. I've nothing to do with all this, cry'd the Inn keeper, pay your Reckoning, and don't trouble me with your fooliſh Stories of a Cock and a Bull: I can't afford to keep Houſe at that Rate. Thou art both a Fool and a Knave of an Inn-keeper, replied <hi>Don Quixote.</hi> And with that, clapping Spurs to <hi>Roſinante,</hi> and brandiſhing his Javelin at his Hoſt, he rode out of the Inn, without any Oppoſition, and got a good way from it without ſo much as once look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing behind him to ſee whether his Squire came af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="146" facs="tcp:54446:100"/>The Knight having thus gloriouſly Bilk'd his Lodging, and Bully'd the Inn-keeper out of his Reckoning, the Maſter being march'd off, there remain'd only the Man, who being as it were left in Pawn, wou'd gladly have ſheer'd off too; but not being ſo lucky in giving his Hoſt the ſlip, he was fairly ſtopt for the Reckoning. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſwore bloodily he would not pay a Croſs; for, the ſelf ſame Law that acquitted the Knight acquitted the Squire. This put the Inn-keeper into a great Paſſion, and made him threaten <hi>Sancho</hi> very hard, telling him if he would not pay him by fair Means, he wou'd have him lay'd by the Heels that Moment. But <hi>Sancho</hi> ſwore by his Maſter's Knighthood, he wou'd ſooner part with his Life than his Mony on ſuch an Account; nor ſhould the Squires in after-Ages ever have occaſion to upbraid him with giving ſo ill a Precedent, or breaking their Rights. But as ill Luck would have it, there happen'd to be in the Inn four <hi>Segovia</hi> Clothiers, three <hi>Cordoua</hi> Point-makers, and two <hi>Sevil</hi> Huckſters, all brisk, gameſome, arch Fellows; who agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all in the ſame Deſign, encompaſs'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> and pull'd him off his Aſs, while one of 'em went to get a Blanket. Then they put the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Squire into it, and carry'd him into the Back-yard, where they toſs'd him in the Air for ſeveral times together in the Blanket, as they do Dogs on <hi>Shrove-Tuſeday</hi> in <hi>Spain.</hi> Poor <hi>Sancho</hi> made ſo grievous an Outcry all the while, that his Maſter heard him; and imagin'd thoſe La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations were of ſome Perſon in Diſtreſs, and conſequently the occaſion of ſome Adventure; but having at laſt diſtinguiſh'd the Voice, he made to the Inn with a broken Gallop, and finding the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:54446:100"/>
Gates ſhut, he rode about to ſee whether he might not find ſome other way to get in. But he no ſooner came to the Back-Yard-Wall, which was none of the higheſt, when he was an Eye Witneſs of the ſcurvy Trick that was put upon his Squire. There he ſaw him aſcend and deſcend, and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and caper in the Air with ſo much Nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Agility, that 'tis thought, the Knight himſelf cou'd not have forborn Laughing, had he been any thing leſs Angry. He did his beſt to get over the Wall, but alas he was ſo bruis'd, that he could not ſo much as alight from his Horſe. This made him fume and chafe, and vent his Paſſion in a thouſand Threats and Curſes, ſo ſtrange and various, that 'tis impoſſible to repeat 'em. But the more he Storm'd, the more they Toſs'd and Laughed; <hi>Sancho</hi> on his ſide Begging, and Howling, and Threatning, and Damning, to as little purpoſe as his Maſter; for 'twas Wearineſs alone cou'd make the Toſſers give over. Then they charitably put an end to his high Dancing, and ſet him upon his Aſs again carefully, wrapt in his Mantle. But <hi>Maritor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>'s tender Soul made her Pity a Male Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in ſuch Tribulation, and thinking he had danc'd and tumbled enough to be a Dry, ſhe was ſo generous as to help him to a Draught of Water, which ſhe purpoſely drew from the Well that Moment, that it might be the cooler. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> clapt the Pot to his Mouth, but his Maſter made him deſiſt; hold, hold, cry'd he, Son <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> Drink no Water Child; 'twill kill thee. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I have here the moſt Holy Balſam, two Drops of which will cure thee effectually. Ha, (reply'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſhaking his Head and looking ſowerly on the Knight with a ſide Face) Have you
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:54446:101"/>
again forgot that I'm no Knight? Or wou'd you have me caſt up the few Guts I've left ſince ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternights Job? Keep your Brewings for your ſelf in the Devil's Name, and let me alone. With that he lifted the Jug to his Noſe, but finding it to be meer Element, he ſpirted out again the little he had taſted, and deſir'd the Wench to help him to ſome better Liquor. So ſhe went and fetch'd him Wine to make him amends, and paid for't too out of her own Pocket; for to give the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil his Due, 'twas ſaid of her, that tho ſhe was ſomewhat too free of her Favours, yet ſhe had ſomething of Chriſtianity in her. As ſoon as <hi>Sancho</hi> had tipp'd off his Wine, he viſited his Aſſes Ribbs Twice or Thrice with his Heels, and free Egreſs being granted him, he troop'd off, mightily tickled with the Thoughts of having had his Ends, and got off ſhot-free, tho at the Expenſe of his Shoulders, his uſual Sureties: 'Tis true, the Inn-keeper kept his Wallet for the Reckoning; but the poor Squire was ſo diſmay'd, and in ſuch haſte to be gone, that he never miſs'd it. The Hoſt was for ſhutting the Inn Doors after him, for fear of the Worſt; but the Toſſers would not let him, being a ſort of Fellows that would not have matter'd <hi>Don Quixote</hi> a Straw, tho he had really been one of the Knights of the Round-Table.</p>

And I the rather believe this, ſeeing, that when I look'd over the Wall and ſaw thee thus abus'd, I ſtrove to get over it, but could not For, nor by any means alight from <hi>Rozinante.</hi> For, by my Honour, cou'd I either have got over the Wall or diſmounted, I wou'd have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd thee ſo effectually on thoſe diſcourteous Wretches, that they ſhou'd never have forgot the Severity of their Puniſhment, tho' for once I had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

my Carcaſs were neither Spirits nor enchanted Folks, as you have it, but meer Fleſh and Blood as we be; I'm ſure they call'd one another by their Chriſtian Names and Sirnames, while they made me vault and frisk in the Air; one was call'd <hi>Pedro Martinez,</hi> t'other <hi>Tenorio Hernandez;</hi> and as for our Dog of a Hoſt, I heard 'em call him <hi>Juan Palomeque</hi> the Left-handed. Then pray don't you fancy, that your not being able to get over the Wall nor to alight was ſome En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanter's Trick. 'Tis a Folly to make many Words, 'tis as plain as the Noſe in a Man's Face that theſe ſame Adventures which we hunt for up and down, are like to bring us at laſt into a Peck of Troubles, and ſuch a plaguy deal of Miſchief, that we ſhan't be able to ſet one Foot before t'other.

(Heav'n help your Head) you came off with the loſs of one Ear and the Vizor of your Helmet.

Beſides this toſſing in a Blanket which fell all to my Share, and for which I can't be reveng'd, becauſe they were Hobgoblins that ſerv'd me ſo forſooth, tho' I hugely long to be even with 'em, that I may know the Pleaſure you ſay there is in vanquiſhing one's Enemy. I find <hi>Sancho,</hi> cry'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> thou and I are both ſick of the ſame Diſeaſe. But I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour with all ſpeed to get me a Sword made with ſo much Art, that no ſort of Inchantment ſhall be able to hurt whoſoever ſhall wear it; and perhaps Fortune may put into my Hands that which <hi>Amadis de Gaul</hi> wore when he ſtyl'd himſelf, <hi>The Knight of the burning Sword,</hi> which was one of the beſt Blades that ever was drawn by Knight; for beſides the Virtue I now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, it had an Edge like a Razor, and wou'd enter the ſtrongeſt Armour that ever was tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd, or inchanted. I'll lay any Thing, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> when you've found this Sword, 'twill prove juſt ſuch another help to me as your Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam; that is to ſay, 'twill ſtand no Body in any ſtead but your Dubb'd Knights, let the poor De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil of a Squire ſhift how he can. Fear no ſuch Thing, reply'd <hi>Don Quixote;</hi> Heaven will be more propitious to thee than thou imagineſt.</p>

                           <p>All this while, <hi>Sancho</hi> ſtood upon the Hill, where he was mortify'd upon the light of this brave Adventure. There he ſtamp'd and ſwore, and bann'd his Maſter to the bottomleſs Pit; he tore his Beard for madneſs, and curs'd the Moment he firſt knew him. But ſeeing him at laſt knock'd down, and ſettled, the Shepherds being ſcam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd, he thought he might venture to come down; and found him in very ill Plight, tho' not altogether ſenſeleſs. Ah Maſter, quoth he, this comes of not taking my Counſel. Did not I tell you 'twas a Flock of Sheep, and no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my? Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> reply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> know, 'tis an eaſie matter for Negromancers to change the Shapes of Things as they pleaſe: Thus that malicious Enchanter, who is my inveterate Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, to deprive me of the Glory which he ſaw me ready to acquire, while I was Reaping a
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:54446:107"/>
full Harveſt of Laurels, transform'd in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the routed Squadrons into Sheep. If thou wilt not believe me, <hi>Sancho,</hi> yet do one thing for my ſake; do but take thy Aſs, and follow thoſe ſuppos'd Sheep at a diſtance, and I dare engage thou ſhalt ſoon ſee 'em reſume their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Shapes, and appear ſuch as I deſcrib'd em. But ſtay, do not go yet, for I want thy Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: Draw near, and ſee how many Cheek-Teeth and others I want, for by the dreadful Pain in my Jaws and Gums, I fear there's a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Dilapidation in my Mouth. With that, the Knight open'd his Mouth as wide as he cou'd, while the Squire gap'd to tell his Grinders, with his Snowt almoſt in his Chaps; but juſt in that fatal Moment the Balſam that lay wambling and fretting in <hi>Don Quixote</hi>'s Stomach, came up with an unlucky <hi>Hickup;</hi> and, with the ſame violence that the Powder flies out of a Gun, all that he had in his Stomach, diſcharg'd it ſelf upon the Beard, Face, Eyes, and Mouth of the officious Squire.

But he had hardly ſaid this, when the Colour, Smell and Taſte ſoon unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd him; and finding it to be his Maſter's loathſom Drench, it turn'd his queaſie Stomach, and caus'd ſuch a ſudden Rumbling in his Maw, that before he cou'd turn his Head he unladed the whole Cargo of his Gizard, full in his Maſter's Face, and put him in as delicate a Pickle as he was himſelf. <hi>Sancho</hi> having thus paid him in his own Coin half blinded as he was, ran to his Aſs, to take out ſomething to clean himſelf and his Maſter. But when he came to look for his

How, quoth <hi>Sancho?</hi> Have I no other ſhare in 'em? Was not he that was toſt in the Blanket this Morning, the Son of my Father? And did
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:54446:108"/>
not the Wallet, and all that was in't, which I have loſt, belong to the Son of my Mother? How, ask'd <hi>Don Quixot,</hi> haſt thou loſt the Wallet? I don't know, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 'tis loſt or no, but I'm ſure I can't tell what's become of it. Nay then reply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> I find we muſt Faſt to Day. Ay marry muſt we, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> unleſs you take Care to gather in theſe Fields ſome of thoſe Roots and Herbs which I've heard you ſay, you know, and which uſe to help ſuch unlucky Knights-Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as your ſelf at a dead Lift. For all that, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> I wou'd rather have at this Time a good Luncheon of Bread, or a Cake and two Pilchards Heads, than all the Roots and Simples in <hi>Dioſcorides</hi>'s Herbal, and Doctor <hi>Laguna</hi>'s Supplement and Commentary; I pray thee therefore get upon thy Aſs, good <hi>Sancho,</hi> and follow me once more; for God's Providence that relieves every Creature will not fail us, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince we are about a Work ſo much to his Service: Thou ſeeſt he even provides for the little flying Inſects in the Air, the Wormlings in the Earth, and the Spawnlings in the Water, and in his infinite Mercy he makes his Sun ſhine on the Righteous, and on the Unjuſt, and rains upon the Good and the Bad. Many Words won't fill a Buſhel, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> interrupting him; you wou'd make a better Preacher, than a Knight Errant, or I'm plaguily out. Knights-Errant, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> ought to know all Things; There have been ſuch in former Ages that have deliver'd as ingenious and learned a Sermon or Oration at the Head of an Army, as if they had taken their Degrees at the Univerſity of <hi>Paris:</hi> From which we may infer, that the Lance ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:54446:109"/>
dull'd the Pen, nor the Pen the Lance. Well then, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> for once let it be as you'd have it; let us e'en leave this unlucky Place, and ſeek out a Lodging; where, I pray God, there may be neither Blankets, nor Blanket-heavers, nor Hobgoblins, nor Inchanted Moors; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I'll be hamper'd as I've been, may I be Curs'd with Bell, Book and Candle, if I don't give the Trade to the Devil. Leave all Things to Providence, reply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> and for once lead which way thou pleaſes, for I leave it wholly to thy Diſcretion to provide us a Lodging. But firſt I pray thee, feel a little how many Teeth I want in my upper Jaw on the right ſide, for there I feel moſt Pain. With that <hi>Sancho</hi> feeling with his Finger in the Knight's Mouth, pray Sir, quoth he, How many Grinders did your Worſhip uſe to have on that ſide? Four, anſwer'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> beſides the Eye-Tooth, all of 'em whole and ſound. Think well on what you ſay, cry'd <hi>Sancho.</hi> I ſay Four, reply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> if there were not Five, for I had never loſt a Tooth before this Day. Bleſs me, quoth <hi>Sancho!</hi> Why, you have in this neather Jaw on this ſide but two Grinders and a Stump; and in that part of your upper Jaw, juſt never a Stump, and never a Grinder, alas all's levell'd there, as ſmooth as the Palm of one's Hand. Oh unfortunate <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> cry'd the Knight! I had rather have loſt an Arm, ſo it were not my Sword Arm; for a Mouth without Cheek-Teeth, is like a Mill without a Mill-ſtone, <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho;</hi> and every Tooth in a Man's Head is more valuable than a Diamond. But we that profeſs this ſtrict Order of Knight-Errantry, are all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to theſe Calamities; and therefore ſince the

                           <p>NOW, Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I can't help think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but that all the Miſhaps that have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall'n us of late, are a juſt Judgment for the grievous Sin you've committed againſt the Order of Knighthood, in not keeping the Oath you Swore, not to eat Bread at Board, nor to have a merry Bout with the Queen, and the Lord knows what more, till you had won <hi>What d'ye call him's</hi> Helmet, <hi>Member</hi> I think you nam'd him. Truly, anſwer'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> thou'rt much in the right, <hi>Sancho:</hi> And to deal Ingenuouſly with thee, I had wholly forgot that; and now thou may'ſt certainly aſſure thy ſelf, thou wer't toſs'd in a Blanket for not remembring to put me in
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:54446:110"/>
Mind of it. However, I will take care to make due Atonement, for Knight-Errantry has ways to conciliate all ſorts of Matters. Why, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> did I ever Swear to Mind you of your Vow? 'Tis nothing to the Purpoſe, reply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> whether thou Swor'ſt or no. Let it ſuffice, that I think thou art not very clear from being acceſſary to the Breach of my Vow; and therefore, to prevent the worſt, there will be no harm in providing a Remedy. Hark you then, cry'd <hi>Sancho;</hi> Be ſure you don't forget your A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, as you did your Oath, leſt thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded Hobthruſhes come and mawl me, and per'anture you too, for being ſtubborn Sinners.</p>
                           <p>Inſenſibly Night overtook 'em before they cou'd diſcover any Lodging; and which was worſe, they were almoſt Hunger-ſtarv'd, all their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion being in the Wallet which <hi>Sancho</hi> had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily left behind; and to compleat their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, there happen'd to 'em an Adventure, or ſomething that really look'd like one.</p>
                           <p>While our benighted Travellers went on dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in the Dark, the Knight very Hungry, and the Squire very ſharp ſet, what ſhou'd they ſee moving towards 'em but a great number of Lights, that appear'd like ſo many wandring Stars. At this ſtrange Apparition, down ſunk <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Heart at once, and even <hi>Don Quixote</hi> himſelf was not without ſome Symptoms of Surprize. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the one pull'd to him his Aſſe's Halter, the other his Horſe's Bridle, and both made a ſtop. They ſoon perceiv'd that the Lights made directly towards 'em, and the nearer they came, the bigger they appear'd. At the terrible Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>Sancho</hi> ſhook and ſhiver'd every Jo'nt, like one in a Palſie, and <hi>Don Quixote</hi>'s Hair ſtood
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:54446:110"/>
up an end; however, heroically ſhaking off the Amazement, which that ſight ſtampt on his Soul, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid he, this muſt doubtleſs be a great and moſt perilous Adventure, where I ſhall have occaſion to exert the whole ſtock of my Courage and Strength. Woe's me, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſhou'd this happen to be another Adventure of enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ghoſts, as I fear me it is, where ſhall we find Ribs to endure it? Come all the Fiends in Hell, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> I will not ſuffer 'em to touch a Hair o' thy Head; if they inſulted thee lately; know there was then between them and me a Wall, over which I cou'd not climb; but now we are in the open Field, where I ſhall have Liberty to make uſe of my Sword. Ay, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> you may Talk, but ſhould they bewitch you as they did before, What a Devil will it avail us to be in the open Field? Come, <hi>Sancho,</hi> reply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> be of good Cheer; the Event will ſoon convince thee of the greatneſs of my Valour. Needs muſt when the Devil Drives, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I'll do my beſt; with that they rode ſomewhat out of the way, and gazing ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly again at the Lights, they ſoon diſcover'd a great number of Perſons all in White. At the dreadful Sight, all Poor <hi>Sancho</hi>'s ſhuffling Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage baſely deſerted him; his Teeth began to Chatter, as if he d been in an Ague-Fit; and as the Objects grew nearer, his Chattering encreas'd. And now they cou'd plainly diſtinguiſh about twenty Men on Horſe-back, all in White, with Torches in their Hands, follow d by a Herſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd over with Black, and ſix Men in deep Mourning, whoſe Mules were alſo in Black, down to their very Heels. Thoſe in White mov'd ſlowly, murmuring from their Lips ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:54446:111"/>
in a low and lamentable Tone. This diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spectacle at ſuch a Time of Night, in the midſt of ſuch a vaſt Solitude, was enough to have Shipwrack'd the Courage of a Stouter Squire than <hi>Sancho,</hi> and even of his Maſter, had he been any other than <hi>Don Quixote.</hi> But his Brain-ſick Imagination ſuggeſting to him that this was one of thoſe Adventures, of which he had ſo often read in his Books of Chivalry; the Herſe appear d to him to be a Litter, where, as he believ'd, lay the Body of ſome Knight, either ſlain or dangerouſly wounded, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of whoſe Misfortunes was reſerv'd for his prevailing Arm. And ſo without any more ado, couching his Lance, and ſeating himſelf firm in his Saddle, he poſted himſelf in the middle of the Road, where the Company were to paſs. As ſoon as they came near, Stand, cry'd he to 'em in a haughty Tone, whoever ye be, and tell me who ye are, whence ye come, whither ye go, and what you carry in that Litter? For there's all the reaſon in the World to believe, that you have either done or receiv'd a great deal of Harm, and 'tis requiſite I ſhould be inform'd of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in order, either to puniſh you for the Ill you have committed, or elſe to revenge you of the Wrong you have ſuffer'd. Sir, anſwer'd one of the Men in white, we are in haſte, the Inn is very far off, and we cannot ſtay to anſwer ſo many Queſtions; and with that ſpurring his Mule he mov'd forwards. But <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> highly diſſatisfy'd with the Reply, laid hold on the Mule's Bridle, and ſtopt him. Stay, cry'd he, proud diſcourteous Knight, mend your Behaviour, and give me inſtantly an Account of what I ask'd of ye; or here I defy ye all to mortal Combat.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:54446:111"/>
Now the Mule that was ſhy and skittiſh, being thus rudely ſeiz'd by the Bridle, was preſently ſcar'd, and riſing up on her hinder Legs, threw her Rider to the Ground. Upon this one of the Footmen that belong'd to the Company gave <hi>Don Quixote</hi> ill Language, which ſo incens'd him, that being reſolv'd to be reveng'd upon 'em all, in a mighty Rage he flew at the next he met, who happen'd to be one of the Mourners. Him he threw to the Ground very much hurt; and then turning to the reſt with a wonderful Agility, he fell upon 'em with ſuch a Fury, that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently put 'em all to Flight; you wou'd have thought <hi>Rozinante</hi> had Wings at that Time, ſo active and ſo fierce he then approv'd himſelf.</p>
                           <p>It was not indeed for Men unarm'd and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally fearful to maintain the Field againſt ſuch an Enemy, no wonder then if the Gentlemen in White were immediately diſpers'd; ſome ran one way, ſome another, croſſing the Plain with their lighted Torches, you wou'd now have taken 'em for a parcel of Frolickſome Maſqueraders gamboling and ſcouring on a Carnaval-Night. As for the Mourners, they, poor Men, were ſo muffled up in their long comberſome Clokes, that not being able to make their Party good, nor defend themſelves, they were preſently rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ran away like the reſt: The rather for that they thought 'twas no mortal Creature, but the Devil himſelf that was come to fetch away the dead Body, which they were accompanying to the Grave. All the while <hi>Sancho</hi> was loſt in Admiration and Aſtoniſhment, charm'd with the Sight of his Maſter's Valour, and now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded him to be the formidable Champion he boaſted himſelf.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="188" facs="tcp:54446:112"/>After this the Knight, by the Light of a Torch that lay burning on the Ground, perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Man who was thrown by his Mule, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near it, he rode up to him, and ſetting his Lance to his Throat, Yield, cry'd he, and beg thy Life, or thou dy'ſt. Alas, Sir, cry'd t'other, what need you ask me to yield? I am not able to ſtir; for one of my Legs is broken. And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, if you're a Chriſtian, do not kill me; I am in Holy Orders, and a Maſter of Arts; 'twou'd be a heinous Sacriledge to take away my Life. What a Devil brought you hither then, if you're a Clergy-man, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote?</hi> What elſe but my ill Fortune, reply'd the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicant. A worſe hovers o'er thy Head, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> and threatens thee, if thou do'ſt not anſwer this moment to every particular Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion I ask. I will, I will, Sir, reply'd the other; and firſt I muſt beg your Pardon for ſaying I was a Maſter of Arts; for I have yet taken but Batchelor's Degree: My Name's <hi>Alonſo Lopez,</hi> I'm of <hi>Alcovendas,</hi> and came now from the Town of <hi>Baeca</hi> with eleven other Clergy-men, the ſame that now ran away with the Torches. We were going to <hi>Segovia</hi> to bury the Corps of a Gentleman of that Town who dy'd at <hi>Baeca,</hi> and lies now in yonder Herſe. And who kill'd him, ask'd <hi>Don Quixote?</hi> Heaven, with a Peſtilential Fever, anſwer'd the other. If it be ſo, ſaid <hi>Don Quixote.</hi> I am diſcharg'd of revenging his Death. Since Heav'n did it, there's no more to be ſaid; had it been its Pleaſure to have taken me off ſo, I too muſt have ſubmitted as I do. All I have now to tell you, Reverend Sir, is that I am a Knight of <hi>La Mancha,</hi> my Name <hi>Don Quixote;</hi> my Employment is to viſit all Parts of the World
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:54446:112"/>
in queſt of Adventures, to right and relieve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd Innocence, and puniſh Oppreſſion. Truly, Sir, reply'd the inferior <hi>Levite,</hi> I don't under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how you can call that to right and relieve Men, when you break their Legs: You've made that crooked that was right and ſtrait before, and Heaven knows whether it can ever be ſet right as long as I live: Inſtead of relieving the Injur'd, I fear you've now injur'd me paſt Relief; and while you ſeek Adventures, you've made me meet with a very great Miſadventure. All Things, reply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> are not bleſt alike with a proſperous Event, good Mr. Batchelor. You ſhou'd have taken Care not to have thus gone a Proceſſioning in theſe Deſolate Plains, at this ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Time of Night, with your white Surplices, burning Torches, and Sable Weeds, like Ghoſts and Goblins that went about to ſcare People out of their Wits. For I cou'd not omit doing the Duty of my Profeſſion; nor wou'd I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born attacking you, tho' you had really been all <hi>Lucifer</hi>'s infernal Crew; for ſuch I took you to be, and till this moment cou'd have no better Opinion of you. Well, Sir, ſaid the Batchelor, ſince 'tis my hard Fortune, I muſt only deſire you, as you're a Knight-Errant and a Reliever of the Oppreſs'd, to help me to get from under my Mule; for it lies ſo heavy on me that I can't get my Foot out of the Stirrup Why did not you acquaint me ſooner with your Grievance, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote?</hi> I might have talk'd on till to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Morning and never have thought on't. With that, he call'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> who made no great haſte for he was much better employ'd, rifling a Load of choice Proviſion which the Holy Men carry'd along with 'em on a Sumpter Mule. He
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:54446:113"/>
had ſpread his Coat on the Ground; and having laid on it as much Food as it wou'd hold, he wrapt it up like a Bag, and laid the precious Booty on his Aſs, and then away he ran to his Maſter, and help'd him to ſet the Batchelor, upon his Mule. After which he gave him his Torch, and <hi>Don Quixote</hi> bid him follow his Company, and excuſe him for his Miſtake; tho', all Things conſider'd, he cou'd not avoid doing what he had done. And Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> if the Gentleman wou'd know who 'twas that ſo well threſh'd their Jackets, you may tell 'em, 'twas the famous <hi>Don Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> otherwiſe call'd the <hi>Knight of the Woful Countenance.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>When the Batchelor was gone, <hi>Don Quixote</hi> ask'd <hi>Sancho</hi> why he call'd him the Knight of the Woful Countenance? I'll tell you why, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> I have been ſtaring upon you this pretty while by the Light of that unlucky Prieſt's Torch, and may I ne'er ſtir if e'er I ſat Eyes on a more Woful Phiz in my born Days; and I can't tell what ſhou'd be the Cauſe on't, unleſs your being tir'd after this Fray, or the want of your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Teeth. This is not the Reaſon, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote;</hi> No, <hi>Sancho,</hi> I rather conjecture that the Sage who is commiſſioned by Fate to regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter my Atchievements, thought it convenient I ſhou'd aſſume a new Appellation as all the Knights of yore. For one was call'd The Knight of the Burning Sword; another of the Unicorn; a third of the Phoenix, a fourth the Knight of the Damſels; another of the Gryphon, and another the Knight of Death. By which <hi>By-names</hi> and Diſtinctions they were known all over the Globe. Therefore doubtleſs that Learned Inchanter, my Hiſtorian, has inſpir'd thee with the Thought of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:54446:113"/>
giving me that additional Appellation, of the Knight of the Woful Countenance. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly I arrogate the Name, and intend hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to be diſtinguiſh'd by that awful Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. And that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

O' my Word, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> you may e'en ſave the Mony; and inſtead of having a Woful Face painted, you need do no more but only ſhow your own: I'm but in Jeſt, as a Body may ſay; but, what with the want of your Teeth, and what with Hunger, you look ſo queerly and ſo wofully, that no Painter can draw you a Face ſo fit for your purpoſe as your Worſhip's. This merry Conceit of <hi>Sancho</hi> extorted a Smile from his Maſter's auſtere Countenance. However he perſiſted in his Reſolution about the Name and the Picture; and after a Pauſe, a ſudden Thought diſturbing his Conſcience, <hi>Sancho,</hi> cry'd he, I am afraid of being Excommunicated, for having laid violent Hands upon a Man in Holy Orders: <hi>Juxta illud; ſi quis ſuadente Diabolo,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Can.</hi> 7. <hi>Diſtinct.</hi> 134. But yet now I think better on't, I never touch'd him with my Hands, but only with my Lance; beſides, I did not in the leaſt ſuſpect I had to do with Prieſts, whom I honour and revere as every good Catholick and faithful Chriſtian ought to do; but rather took 'em to be evn Spirits.

Who knows but theſe ſame Fellows that are now ſcamper'd off may chance to bethink themſelves what a ſhame it is for 'em to have ſuffered themſelves to be thus routed by a ſingle Man, and ſo come back and fall upon us all at once, then we ſhall have Work enough upon our Hands.

                           <p>After they had rid a little way, they came to a Valley that lay ſculking between two Hills; there they alighted; and <hi>Sancho</hi> having open'd his Coat and ſpread it on the Graſs, with the Proviſion which he had bundled up in it, our two Adventurers fell on; and their Stomachs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſharpen'd with the Sawce of Hunger, they eat their Breakfaſt, Dinner, Afternoons-Luncheon and Supper, all at one Time; feaſting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with variety of cold Meat, which you may be ſure was the beſt that could be got; the Prieſts, who had brought it for their own eating, being like the reſt of their Coat, none of the worſt Stewards for their Bellies, and knowing how to make much of themſelves.</p>

                              <pb n="193" facs="tcp:54446:114"/>But now they began to grow ſenſible of a very great Misfortune, and ſuch a Misfortune as was bemoan'd by poor <hi>Sancho</hi> as one of the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt that ever could befal him. For they found they had not a drop of Wine to waſh down their Meat and quench their Thirſt, which now ſcorch'd and choakt 'em worſe than Hunger had pinch'd 'em before. However, <hi>Sancho</hi> conſidering they were in a Place where the Graſs was freſh and green, ſaid to his Maſter—What you ſhall find in the following Chapter.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of a moſt wonderful Adventure atchiev'd by the valorous <hi>Don Quixote de la Mancha;</hi> the like never compaſs'd with leſs Danger by any of the moſt famous Knights in the World.</head>
                           <p>THE Graſs is ſo freſh (quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> half choak'd with Thirſt) that I dare lay my Life we ſhall light o' ſome Spring or Stream hereabouts; therefore, Sir, let's look, I beſeech you, that we may quench this confounded Drowth that plagues our Throats ten times worſe than Hunger did our Guts. Thereupon <hi>Don Quixote</hi> leading <hi>Rozinante</hi> by the Bridle, and <hi>Sancho</hi> his Aſs by the Halter, after he had laid up the Reverſion of their Meal, they went feeling about, only guided by their Gueſs; for 'twas ſo dark they ſcarce cou'd ſee their
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:54446:115"/>
Hands. They had not gone above two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Paces before they heard a Noiſe of a great Water fall; which was to them the moſt welcome Sound in the World. But then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſt'ning with great Attention to know on which ſide the grateful Murmur came, they on a ſudden heard another kind of Noiſe that ſtrangely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay'd the pleaſure of the firſt, eſpecially in <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> who was naturally no Hero, and ſufficiently a Coward. They heard a terrible Din of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreperous Blows, ſtruck with Meaſure, and a more dreadful rattling of Chains and Irons, which together with the roaring of the Waters, might have fill'd any other Heart but <hi>Don Quixote</hi>'s with Terror and Amazement. Add to this the Horrors of dark Night and Solitude, in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Place, the loud ruſtling of the Leaves of ſome lofty Trees, under which Fortune brought 'em at the ſame unlucky Moment; and the whiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Wind, which concurr'd with the other diſmaying Sounds; the fall of the Waters, the thundering Thumps, and the clinking of Chains. The worſt too was, that the Blows were redoubled without ceaſing, the Wind blow'd on, and Day-light was far diſtant. But then it was, that <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> ſecur'd by Intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity his unſeparable Companion, mounted his <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>zinante,</hi> brac'd his Shield, brandiſh'd his Lance, and ſhew'd a Soul unknowing Fear, and Superior to Danger and Fortune. Know, <hi>Sancho,</hi> cry'd he, I was born in this Iron Age, to reſtore the Age of Gold, or the Golden Age, as ſome chuſe to call it. I am the Man for whom Fate has reſerv'd the moſt dangerous and formidable Attempts, the moſt ſtupendous and glorious Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, and the moſt valorous Feats of Arms.
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:54446:115"/>
I am the Man who muſt revive the Order of the Round-Table, the twelve Peers of <hi>France,</hi> and the nine Worthies. I am the Man whoſe ne're-to-be-forgotten Atchievements muſt efface the Memory of your <hi>Platirs,</hi> your <hi>Tablantes,</hi> your <hi>Olivantes,</hi> and your <hi>Tiranſes.</hi> Now muſt your Knights <hi>of the Sun,</hi> your <hi>Belianis's,</hi> and all the numerous Throng of vulgar Heroes, and Knights-Errant of former Ages, ſee the Glory of all their moſt dazzling Actions eclips'd and darken'd by my more illuſtrious Exploits. Do but obſerve, O thou my faithful Squire, what a <hi>Multifarious Aſſemblage</hi> of Terrors ſurrounds us! A horrid Darkneſs, a doleful Solitude, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd ruſtling of Leaves, a diſmal rattling of Chains, a howling of the Winds, an aſtoniſhing noiſe of Cataracts, that ſeem to fall with a boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous Rapidity, from the ſteep Mountains of the Moon; a terrible ſound of redoubled Blows, ſtill wounding our Ears like furious Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claps, and a dead and univerſal Silence of thoſe Things that might buoy up the ſinking Courage of frail Mortality. In this Extremity of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, <hi>Mars</hi> himſelf might tremble with affright. Yet I in the midſt of all theſe unutterable A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larms, ſtill remain undaunted and unſhaken. Theſe are but Incentives to my Valour, and but animate my Heart the more; it grows too big and mighty for my Breaſt, and leaps at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of this threatning Adventure, as formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable as 'tis like to prove. Come, girt <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zinante</hi> ſtreighter, and then Providence protect thee: Thou may'ſt ſtay for me here; but if I do not return in three Days, go back to our Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage; and from thence, for my ſake, to <hi>Toboſo,</hi> where thou ſhalt ſay to my incomparable Lady

                              <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> That her faithful Knight fell a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to Love and Honour, while he attempted Things that might make him worthy to be call'd her Adorer.</p>
                           <p>When <hi>Sancho</hi> heard his Maſter talk thus, he fell a weeping in the moſt pitiful manner in the World. Pray, Sir, cry'd he, why will you thus run your ſelf into Miſchief? What need you go about this rueful Miſventure? 'Tis main Dark, and there's ne're a living Soul ſees us; we have nothing to do but to ſheer off, and get out of Harm's way, tho' we were not to drink a Drop theſe three Days. Who is there to take notice of our Flinching? I've heard our Parſon, whom you very well know, ſay in's Pulpit, That he who ſeeks Danger, periſheth therein. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhou'd not tempt Heaven, by going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a thing that we cannot compaſs but by a Miracle. Is't not enough, think you, that it has preſerv'd you from being toſs'd in a Blanket, as I was, and made you come off ſafe and ſound from among ſo many Gobblins that went with the dead Man? If all this won't work upon that hard Heart of yours, do but think of me, and reſt your ſelf aſſur'd, that when once you've left your poor <hi>Sancho,</hi> he'll be ready to give up the Ghoſt for very Fear, to the next that will come for't: I left my Houſe and Home, my Wife, Children, and all to follow you, hoping to be the better for't, and not the worſe; but as Covetouſneſs breaks the <hi>Jack,</hi> ſo has it broke Me and my Hopes; for while I thought my ſelf Cock-ſure of that unlucky and accurſed Iſland, which you ſo often promis'd me, you mean to drop me here in a ſtrange Place. Dear Maſter, don't be ſo hard hearted; and if you won't be
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:54446:116"/>
perſuaded not to meddle with this ungracious Adventure, do but put it off till you can ſee: 'Tis but three Hours to Day-light; for, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my little Skill, the Muzzle of the leſſer Bear is juſt over our Heads. How can'ſt thou ſee the Muzzle of the Bear, ask'd <hi>Don Quixote?</hi> There's not a Star to be ſeen in the Sky? That's true, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> but Fear is ſharp-ſighted, and can ſee things under Ground, and much more in the Skies. Let Day come or not come, 'tis all one to me, cry'd the Champion; it ſhall never be recorded of <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> that either Tears or Entreaties cou'd make him neglect the Duty of a Knight. Then, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſay no more; for Heaven that has inſpir'd me with a Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of attempting this dreadful Adventure, will certainly take Care of me and thee: Come quickly, girt my Steed, and ſtay here for me; for you will ſhortly hear of me again, either alive or dead.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Sancho</hi> finding his Maſter obſtinate, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be mov'd by Tears nor good Advice, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to try a Trick of Policy to keep him there till Day-light: And accordingly, while he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to faſten the Girts, he ſlily ty'd <hi>Rozi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nante</hi>'s hinder Legs with his Aſſe's Halter, without being ſo much as ſuſpected: So that when <hi>Don Quixote</hi> thought to have mov'd forwards, he found his Horſe wou'd not go a ſtep without leaping, tho' he ſpurr'd him on ſmartly. <hi>Sancho</hi> perceiving his Plot took; look you, Sir, quoth he, Heaven's o' my ſide, and won't let <hi>Rozinante</hi> budge a foot forwards; and now if you'll ſtill be ſpurring him, I dare Pawn my Life 'twill be but ſtriving againſt the Stream; or, as the Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, But kicking againſt the Pricks. <hi>Don
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:54446:117"/>
Quixote</hi> fretted, and chaſed, and rav'd, and was in a deſperate Fury to find his Horſe ſo Stubborn; but at laſt obſerving that the more he ſpurr'd and gall'd his Sides, the more reſty he prov'd, tho' unwilling to go, he reſolv'd to have Patience till 'twas Light. Well, ſaid he, ſince <hi>Rozinante</hi> will not leave this Place, I muſt tarry in't till the Dawn, tho' its ſlowneſs will coſt me ſome Sighs. You ſhall not need to Sigh nor be Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencholy, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> for I'll undertake to tell you Stories till it be Day, unleſs your Worſhip had rather get off of your Horſe, and take a Nap upon the green Graſs, as Knights-Errant are wont, that you may be the freſher and the beterr<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>able in the Morning to go thro' that monſtrous Adventure that waits for you. What do'ſt thou mean with this Alighting and Sleeping, reply'd <hi>Don Quixote?</hi> Think'ſt thou I am one of thoſe Carpet-Knights that abandon themſelves to Sleep and lazy Eaſe, when Danger is at hand? No, Sleep thou, that a'rt Born to Sleep; or do what thou wilt. As for my ſelf, I know what I have to do. Good Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> don't put your ſelf into a Paſſion, I meant no ſuch Thing not I: Evil be to them that Evil think. Saying this, he clapt one of his Hands upon the Pummel of <hi>Rozinante</hi>'s Sadle, and tother upon the Crupper, and thus he ſtood embracing his Maſter's left Thigh, not daring to budge an Inch, for fear of the Blows that dinn'd continually in his Ears. <hi>Don Quixote</hi> then thought fit to claim his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and deſir'd him to tell ſome of his Stories to help to paſs away the Time. Sir, qouth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I'm wofully frighted; and have no Heart to tell Stories, however I'll do my beſt, and now I think on't there's one come into my Head,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:54446:117"/>
which if I can but hit on't right, and nothing happen to put me out, is the beſt Story you ever heard in your Life: Therefore liſten, for I'm go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to begin. In the Days of Yore, when it was as it was, Good betide us all, and Evil to him that Evil ſeeks. And here, Sir, you are to take notice that they of old did not begin their Tales with ordinary Diſcourſe; for't was a ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a wiſe Man whom they call'd <hi>Cato Zon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorin,</hi> that ſaid, Evil to him that Evil ſeeks, which is as Pat for your purpoſe, as a Pudding for a Fryer's Mouth; that you may neither meddle nor make, nor ſeek Evil and Miſchief for the nonce, but rather get out of harm's way, for no Body forces us to run into the Mouth of all the Devils in Hell that wait for us yonder, Go on with thy Story, <hi>Sancho,</hi> cry'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> and leave the reſt to my Diſcretion. I ſay then, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that in a Country-Town in <hi>Eſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madura,</hi> there liv'd a certain Shepherd, Goatherd I ſhould have ſaid. Which Goatherd, as the Story has it, was call'd <hi>Lope Ruyz,</hi> and this <hi>Lope Ruyz</hi> was in Love with a Sheperdeſs, whoſe name was <hi>Toralva,</hi> the which Shepherdeſs whoſe name was <hi>Toralva,</hi> was the Daughter of a wealthy Grazier, and this Grazier— If thou goeſt on at this rate, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> and mak'ſt ſo many needleſs Repetitions, thou'lt not have told thy Story theſe two Days. Prethee tell it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely, and like a Man of Senſe, or let it alone. I tell it you, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> as all Stories are told in our Country, and I can't for the Blood of me tell it any other way, nor is it fit I ſhould alter the Cuſtom. Why then, tell it how thou wilt, reply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> ſince my ill Fortune forces me to ſtay and hear thee. Well then,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:54446:118"/>
Dear Sir of my Soul, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> as I was ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, this ſame Shepherd, Goatherd I ſhou'd have ſaid, was woundily in Love with that ſame Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſs <hi>Toralva,</hi> who was a well truſs'd, round, crummy, ſtrapping Wench, Coy and Froppiſh, and ſomewhat like a Man, for ſhe had a kind of a Beard on her upper Lip. Methinks I ſee her now ſtanding before me. Then I ſuppoſe thou knewſt her, ſaid <hi>Don Quixote.</hi> Not I anſwer'd <hi>Sancho:</hi> I nere ſat Eyes on her in my born Days: But he that told me the Story, ſaid, this was ſo true, that I might vouch it for a real Truth, and even ſwear I had ſeen it all my ſelf. Well,— but as you know, Days go and come, and Time and Straw make Medlars ripe, ſo it happen'd that after ſeveral Days coming and going, the Devil who ſeldom lies Dead in a Ditch, but will have a Finger in every Pye, ſo brought it about, that the Shepherd fell out with his Sweet-heart, inſomuch that the Love he bore her turn'd into Dudgeon and ill Will. And the cauſe was, by report of ſome miſchievous Tale-Carriers that bare no good Will to either Party, for that the Shepherd thought her no better than ſhe ſhou'd be; and looſe i' the Hilt and free of her Hips. Thereupon being grievous in the Dumps about it, and now bitterly hating her, he e'en reſolv'd to leave that Country to get out of her Sight: For now, as every Dog has his Day, the Wench perceiving he came no longer a Suitering to her, but rather toſs'd his Noſe at her, and ſhunn'd her, ſhe began to Love him and doat upon him like any thing, haunting and following him up and down like a <hi>Tanthony-Pig.</hi> That's the Nature of Women, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> not to Love when we Love 'em, and to Love when we Love 'em
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:54446:118"/>
not. But go on— The Shepherd then gave her the ſlip, continu'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> and driving his Goats before him, went trudging thro' <hi>Eſtramadura,</hi> in his way to <hi>Portugal.</hi> But <hi>Toralva</hi> having a long Noſe ſmelt his Deſign, and then what does ſhe do, think ye, but come after him bare-Foot and bare-Leg'd, with a Pilgrim's Staff in her Hand, and a Wallet at her Back, wherein they ſay ſhe carried a piece of a Looking-Glaſs, half a Comb, a broken Pot with Paint; and I don't know what other Trinkum Trankums to prink her ſelf up. But let her carry what ſhe wou'd, 'tis no Bread and Butter of mine, the ſhort and the long is, That they ſay the Shepherd with his Goats, got at laſt to the River <hi>Guadiana,</hi> which happen'd to be overflow'd at that Time, and what's worſe than ill Luck, there was neither Boat nor Bark to Ferry him over; which vex'd him the more becauſe he perceiv'd <hi>Toralva</hi> at his Heels, and he fear'd to be teiz'd and plagu'd with her Weeping and Wailing, At laſt he ſpy'd a Fiſher-Man in a little Boat, but ſo little it was, that it wou'd carry but one Man and one Goat at a Time. Well, for all that, he call'd to the Fiſher-Man, and agreed with him to carry him and his three hundred Goats over the Water. The Bargain being ſtruck, the Fiſher-Man came with his Boat and carried over one Goat. Then he row'd back and fetch'd another Goat, and after that another Goat. Pray Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> beſure you keep a good Account how many Goats the Fiſher-Man Ferries over, for if you happen but to miſs one, my Tale's at an end, and the Devil a Word more I have to ſay. Well then, where abouts was I?— Ho! I ha't— Now the landing Place on the other ſide was very Muddy and Slippery, which made the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:54446:119"/>
Fiſher-Man be a long while in going and coming. Yet for all that, he took Heart o' Grace, and made ſhift to carry over one Goat, then another, and then another. Come, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> we'll ſuppoſe he has landed 'em all on the other ſide of the River; for as thou go'ſt One by One we ſhall not have done theſe twelve Months. Pray, let me go on my own way, quoth <hi>Sancho:</hi> How many Goats are got over already? Nay, how the Devil can I tell, reply'd <hi>Don Quixote.</hi> There it is, quoth <hi>Sancho!</hi> Did not I bid you keep 'Count? On my Word the Tale's at an end, and now you may go whiſtle for the reſt. Ridiculous, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote:</hi> Prethee is there no going on with the Story unleſs I know exactly how many Goats are wafted over? No, marry, is there not, quoth <hi>Sancho:</hi> For as ſoon as you anſwer'd, that you cou'd not tell, the reſt of the Story quite and clean ſlipt out of my Head; and Troth 'tis a thouſand Pities, for 'twas a ſpecial one. So then, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> the Story's ended. Ay marry is it, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> 'tis no more to be fetch'd to Life than my Dead Mother. Upon my Honour, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> a moſt extraordinary Story, and told and concluded in as extraord nary a manner. 'Tis a None ſuch I dare engage; tho' truly I expected no leſs from a Man of ſuch uncommon Parts. Alas! poor <hi>Sancho,</hi> I am affraid this dreadful Noiſe has turn'd thy Brain: That may well be, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but as for my Story I'm ſure there's nothing more to be ſaid; for where you loſe the Account of the Goats there it ends. Let it be ſo, reply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> but now let's try whether <hi>Rozinante</hi> be in Humour to March; with that he gave <hi>Rozi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nante</hi> two Spurs, and the high mettl'd Jade an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:54446:119"/>
with one Bound, and then ſtood ſtock ſtill, not having the command of his hind Legs.</p>
                           <p>Much about this Time, whether it were the Coolneſs of the Night, or that <hi>Sancho</hi> had eaten ſome looſening Food at Supper, or which ſeems more probable, that Nature by a regular Impulſe gave him notice of her Deſire to perform a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Function that follows the third Concoction, it ſeems, honeſt <hi>Sancho</hi> found himſelf urg'd to do that which no body cou'd do for him: But ſuch were his Fears that he durſt not for his Life ſtir the breadth of a Straw from his Maſter; yet to think of bearing the intolerable Load that preſs'd him ſo, was to him as great an impoſſibility: In this perplexing Exigency, with leave be it ſpoken) he cou'd find no other Expedient but to take his right Hand from the Crupper of the Saddle, and ſoftly untying his Breeches, let 'em drop down to his Heels, having done this, he as ſilently took up his Shirt, and expos'd his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriors, which were none of the leaſt, to the open Air. But the main Point was how to eaſe himſelf of this terrible Burthen, without making a Noiſe. To which purpoſe he clutch'd his Teeth cloſe, ſcru'd up his Face, ſhrunk up his Shoulders, and held his Breath as much as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Yet ſee what Misfortunes attend the beſt projected Undertakings. When he had almoſt compaſs'd his Deſign, he cou'd not hinder an obſtreperous ſound very different from thoſe that caus'd his Fear from unluckily burſting out. Hark! cry'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> who hear'd it, what Noiſe is that, <hi>Sancho?</hi> Some new Adventure, I'll warrant you, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> for ill Luck, you know, ſeldom comes alone. Having paſs'd off the Thing thus, he e'en ventur'd t'other Strain,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:54446:120"/>
and did it ſo cleverly, that, without the leaſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port or Whiſper, his Buſineſs was done effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, to the unſpeakable Eaſe of his Body and Mind.</p>
                           <p>But <hi>Don Quixote</hi> having the Senſe of Smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling as perfect as that of Hearing, and <hi>Sancho</hi> ſtanding ſo very near or rather join'd to him, certain Fumes that aſcended perpendicularly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to regale his Noſtrils with a Smell not ſo grateful as Amber. No ſooner the unwelcome Steams diſturb'd him but having Recourſe to the common Remedy, he ſtop'd his Noſe, and then with a ſnaffling Voice, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid he, thou art certainly in great Bodily Fear. So I am, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> but what makes your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip perceive it now more than you did before? Becauſe, reply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> thou ſmelleſt now more unſavorily than thou didſt before. Hoh, that may be, quoth <hi>Sancho.</hi> But whoſe Fault's that? You may e'en thank your ſelf for't. Why do you lead me a wild Gooſe-chace, and bring me at ſuch unſeaſonable Hours to ſuch dangerous Places? You know I a'n't us'd to't. Prethee, ſaid <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> ſtill holding his Noſe, get thee three or four Steps from me; and for the future take more Care, and know your Diſtance; for I find, thou thinkſt my Familiarity with thee may priviledge thee to want Reſpect. I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> you think I have been do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ng ſomething I ſhould not have done. Come, ſay no more, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> the more thou'ſt ſtir, the worſe 'twill be.</p>
                           <p>This Diſcourſe, ſuch as it was, ſerved them to paſs away the Night; and now <hi>Sancho</hi> ſeeing the Morning ariſe thought it time to unty <hi>Rozinante</hi>'s Feet, and do up his Breeches; and he did both
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:54446:120"/>
with ſo much Caution that his Maſter ſuſpected nothing. As for <hi>Rozinante</hi> he no ſooner felt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at Liberty, but he ſeemed to expreſs his Joy by pawing the Ground; for, with his Leave be it ſpoken, he was a Stranger to Curvetting and Prancing. <hi>Don Quixote</hi> alſo took it as a good Omen that his Steed was now ready to move, and believed it was a Signal given him by kind Fortune, to animate him to give Birth to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Adventure.</p>
                           <p>Now had <hi>Aurora</hi> diſplay'd her roſy Mantle over the bluſhing Skies, and dark Night with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn her Sable Veil; all Objects ſtood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to human Eyes, and <hi>Don Quixote</hi> could now perceive he was under ſome tall Cheſnut-Trees, whoſe thick ſpreading Boughs diffus'd an awful Gloom around the Place, but he could not yet diſcover whence proceeded the diſmal Sound of thoſe inceſſant Strokes. Therefore, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to find it out, once more he took his Leave of <hi>Sancho,</hi> with the ſame Injunctions as before; adding withal, that he ſhould not trouble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf about the Recompence of his Services, for he had taken Care of that in his Will, which he had providently made before he left home; but if he came off victorious from this Adventure, he might moſt certainly expect to be gratify'd with the Promiſed Iſland. <hi>Sancho</hi> could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear blubbering again, to hear theſe tender Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of his Maſter, and reſolved not to leave him till he had finiſhed this Enterprize. And from that deep Concern, and this nobler Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to attend him, the Author of this Hiſtory infers, that the Squire was ſomething of a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman by Deſcent, or at leaſt the Offspring of the old Chriſtians. Nor did his good Nature
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:54446:121"/>
fail to move his Maſter, more than he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſhew it at a Time when it behov'd him to ſhake off all ſofter Thoughts. For now he rode towards the Place whence the Noiſe of the Blows and the Water ſeem'd to come, while <hi>Sancho</hi> trudg'd after him, leading by the Halter the inſeparable Companion of his good and bad Fortune.</p>
                           <p>After they had gone a pretty way under a pleaſing Covert of Cheſnut-Trees, they came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Meadow adjoining to certain Rocks, from whoſe Top there was a great Fall of Waters. At the Foot of thoſe Rocks they diſcover'd certain old ill-contriv'd Buildings, that rather look'd like Ruins than inhabited Houſes; and they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd that the terrifying Noiſe of the Blows which yet continued iſſu'd out of that Place. When they came nearer, even patient <hi>Rozinante</hi> himſelf ſtarted at the dreadful Sound; but being heartened and pacified by his Maſter, he was at laſt prevail'd with to draw nearer and nearer with wary Steps, the Knight recommending himſelf all the way moſt devoutly to his <hi>Dulci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea,</hi> and now and then alſo to Heaven in ſhort Ejaculations.

                              <hi>Don Quixote</hi> was ſtruck dumb at this unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Sight, and was ready to drop from his Horſe with Shame and Confuſion. <hi>Sancho</hi> ſtar'd upon him, and ſaw him hang down his Head, with a deſponding dejected Countenance, like a Man quite diſpirited with this curſed Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. At the ſame Time he look'd upon <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> and ſeeing by his Eyes and his Cheeks, ſwell'd with Laughter, that he was ready to burſt, he could not forbear laughing himſelf, in ſpight of all his Vexation. So that <hi>Sancho</hi> ſeeing his Maſter begin, immediately gave a Looſe to his Mirth, and broke out into ſuch a Fit of Laughing, that he was forc'd to hold his Sides with both his Knuckles for fear of burſting his aking Paunch. Four times he ceas'd, and four times renew'd his obſtreperous Laughing; which Saucineſs <hi>Don Quixote</hi> began to reſent with great Indignation; and the more when <hi>Sancho</hi> in a jeering Tone preſum'd to ridicule him with his own Words, repeating part of the vain Speech he made when firſt they heard the Noiſe; <hi>Know,</hi> Sancho, <hi>I was born in this Iron Age to reſtore the Age of Gold. I am the Man for whom Heaven has reſerv'd the moſt dangerous and glorious Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> &amp;c. Thus he went on, till his Maſter, dreadfully inrag'd at his Inſolence, hit him two ſuch Blows on the Shoulders with his Lance, that had they fallen upon his Head they had ſav'd <hi>Don Quixote</hi> the trouble of paying him his Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, whatever he muſt have done to his Heirs. Thereupon <hi>Sancho,</hi> finding his Jeſt turn'd to Earneſt, begg'd Pardon with all Submiſſion: Mercy, good your Worſhip, cry'd he, ſpare my Bones I beſeech you! I meant no harm, I did but joke a little. And becauſe you joke, I do
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:54446:122"/>
not, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote.</hi> Come hither, good Mr. Jeſter, you who pretend to rally, tell me, Had this been a dangerous Adventure, as well as it proves only a falſe Alarm, have I not ſhewn Reſolution enough to undertake and finiſh it? Am I, who am a Knight, bound to know the meaning of every Mechanick Noiſe, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between Sound and Sound? Beſides, it might happen, as really it is, that I had never ſeen a Fulling-Mill before, tho' thou, like a baſe Scoundrel as thou art, wert born and brought up among ſuch mean Implements of Drudgery. But let the ſix Fulling-Maces be transform'd into ſo many Giants, then turn 'em in my Face one by one, or all together; and if I do nor lay 'em all at my Feet with their Heels upwards, then I'll give thee Leave to exerciſe thy ill-bred Raillery as much as thou pleaſeſt.</p>
                           <p>Good your Worſhip, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> talk no more on't, I beſeech you; I confeſs I carry'd the Jeſt too far. But now all's huſh'd and well, pray tell me in ſober Sadneſs as you hope to ſpeed in all Adventures, and come off ſafe and ſound as from this, don't you think but that the Fright we were in, I mean that I was in, would be a good Subject for People to make ſport with? I grant it, anſwer'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> but I would not have it told; for all People are not ſo diſcreet as to place Things or look upon 'em in the Poſition in which they ſhould be conſider'd.

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:54446:122"/>
heard my Gran'am ſay, That Man loves thee well, who makes thee to weep. Good Maſters may be haſty ſometimes with a Servant; but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after a hard Word or two they commonly give him a pair of caſt Breeches. What they give after a Baſting, Heav'n knows; all I can tell is that Knights-Errant after Baſtinadoes, give you ſome caſt Iſland, or ſome old-faſhion'd King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom upon the main Land.</p>
                           <p>Fortune, ſaid <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> will perhaps order ev'ry thing thou haſt ſaid to come to paſs; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Sancho,</hi> I prithee think no more of my Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity; thou knowſt a Man cannot always com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the firſt Impulſe of his Paſſions. On the other ſide, let me adviſe thee not to be ſo ſaucy for the future; and not to aſſume that ſtrange Familiarity with me which is ſo unbecoming in a Servant. I proteſt, in ſuch a vaſt number of Books of Knight-Errantry as I have read, I never found that any Squire was ever allow'd ſo great a Freedom of Speech with his Maſter as thou takeſt with me; and truly I look upon it to be a great Fault in us both; in thee for diſreſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, and in me for not making my ſelf be more reſpected. <hi>Gandalin, Amadis de Gaule</hi>'s Squire, tho' he was Earl of the Firm Iſland, yet he never ſpoke to his Maſter, but with Cap in Hand, his Head bow'd and his Body half bent, after the Turkiſh manner. But what ſhall we ſay of <hi>Gaſabel, Don Galaor</hi>'s Squire, who was ſuch a ſtrict obſerver of Silence, that to the Honour of this affected Taciturnity, he gave the Author oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to mention his Name but once in that vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminous authentick Hiſtory. From all this <hi>Sancho,</hi> I would have thee make this Obſervation, That there ought to be a Diſtance kept between
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:54446:123"/>
the Maſter and the Man, the Knight and the Squire. Therefore once more I tell thee, let's live together for the future more according to the due Decorum of our reſpective Degrees, without giving one another any further Vexation on this Account; for, after all, 'twill always be the worſe for you on whatſoever Occaſion we hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to diſagree. As for the Rewards I promiſed you, they will come in due Time; and ſhould you be diſappointed that way, you have your Salary to truſt to, as I have told you.</p>
                           <p>You ſay very well, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> but now Sir, ſuppoſe no Rewards ſhould come, and I ſhould be forc'd to ſtick to my Wages, I'd fain know how much a Squire-Errant us'd to earn in the days of yore? Did they go by the Month or by the Day like our Labourers? I don't think, reply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> they ever went by the Hire, but rather that they truſted to their Maſter's Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity. And if I have aſſign'd thee Wages in my Will, which I left ſeal'd up at home, 'twas only to prevent the worſt; becauſe I do not know yet what Succeſs I may have in Chivalry in theſe miſerable Times; and I would not have my Soul ſuffer in the other World for ſuch a trifling Matter: For there is no ſtate of Life ſo ſubject to Dangers as that of a Knight-Errant. Like enough, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> when meerly the Noiſe of the Hammers of a Fulling-Mill is able to trouble and diſturb the Heart of ſuch a valiant Knight as your Worſhip. But you may be ſure I'll not hereafter ſo much as offer to open my Lips to jibe or joke at your Doings, but always ſtand in awe of you, and honour you as my Lord and Maſter. By doing ſo, reply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> thou ſhalt live on the Face of the

                           <p>AT the ſame time it began to Rain, and <hi>Sancho</hi> would fain have taken Shelter in the Fulling-Mills. But <hi>Don Quixote</hi> had conceiv'd ſuch an Antipathy againſt 'em for the Shame they had put upon him, that he would by no means be prevail'd with to go in; and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Right Hand he ſtruck into a High-way, where they had not gone far before he diſcover'd a Horſeman, who wore upon his Head ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that glitter'd like Gold. The Knight had no ſooner ſpy'd him, but turning to his Squire, <hi>Sancho,</hi> cry'd he, I believe there's no Proverb but what is true; they are all ſo many Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences and Maxims drawn from Experience, the Univerſal Mother of Sciences: for Inſtance that Saying, That where one Door ſhuts, another opens. Thus Fortune that laſt N ght deceiv'd us with the falſe Project of an Adventure, this Morning offers us a real one to make us amends: And ſuch an Adventure, <hi>Sancho,</hi> that if I do not gloriouſly ſucceed in it, I ſhall have now no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:54446:124"/>
to an Excuſe; no Darkneſs, no unknown Sounds to impute my Diſappointment to. In ſhort, in all probability, yonder comes the Man who wears on his Head <hi>Mambrino</hi>'s Helmet, and thou know'ſt the Vow I have made. Good Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> mind what you ſay, and take heed what you do; for I wou'd willingly keep my Carcaſs and the Caſe of my Underſtanding from being pounded, maſh'd, and cruſh'd with Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-Hammers. Hell take thee, Blockhead, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote!</hi> Is there no difference between a Helmet and a Fulling-Mill? I don't know, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but I'm ſure were I ſuffer'd to ſpeak my Mind now, as I was wont, mayhaps I wou'd give you ſuch main Reaſons, that you your ſelf ſhou'd ſee you're wide of the Matter. How can I be miſtaken; thou eternal Misbeliever, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote?</hi> Do'ſt thou not ſee that Knight who comes riding up directly towards us upon a Dapple-grey Steed, with a Helmet of Gold on his Head? I ſee what I ſee, reply'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> and the Devil of any thing I can ſpy, but a Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon ſuch another grey Aſs as mine is, with ſomething that gliſters o' top of his Head. I tell thee, that's <hi>Mambrino</hi>'s Helmit, reply'd <hi>Don Quixote;</hi> and therefore ſtand at a diſtance, and leave me to deal with him: Thou ſhal't ſee that without trifling away ſo much as a Moment in needleſs Talk, I'll finiſh this Adventure, and poſſeſs my ſelf of the deſir'd Helmet. I ſhall ſtand at a diſtance you may be ſure, quoth <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho;</hi> but I wiſh this mayn't prove another blew Bout, and a worſe Job than the Fulling-Mills. I have warn'd you already, Fellow, ſaid <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> not ſo much as to name the Fulling-Mills; dare but once more to do it, nay but
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:54446:124"/>
to think on't, and I vow to—I ſay no more, but I'll full and pound your Dog's-ſhip into Jel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Theſe Threats were more than ſufficient to Padlock <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Lips; for he had no mind to have his Maſter's Vow fulfill'd at the Expence of his Bones.</p>
                           <p>Now the Truth of the Story was this: There were in that part of the Country two Villages, one of which was ſo little that it had not ſo much as a Shop in't, nor any Barber. So that the Barber of the greater Village ſerv'd alſo the ſmaller. And thus a Perſon happening to have occaſion to be let Blood, and another to be Shav'd, the Barber was going thither with his Braſs Baſon, which he had clapt upon his Head to keep his Hat, that chanc'd to be a new one, from being ſpoilt by the Rain; and as the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was new ſcowr'd, it made a glittering ſhow a great way off. As <hi>Sancho</hi> had well obſerv'd he rode upon a grey Aſs, which <hi>Don Quixote</hi> as eaſily took for a Dapple grey Steed, as he took the Barber for a Knight, and his Braſs Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for a Golden Helmet, his diſtracted Brain eaſily applying ev'ry Object to his Romantic Ideas. Therefore when he ſaw the poor imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Knight draw near, he fix'd his Lance or Javelin to his Thigh, and without ſtaying to hold a Parley with his thoughtleſs Adverſary, flew at him as fiercely as <hi>Rozinante</hi> wou'd Gallop, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to pierce him through and through; cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out in the midſt of his Career, <hi>Caitif,</hi> Wretch, defend thy ſelf, or immediately ſurrender that which is ſo juſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ly my due. The Barber, who as he peaceably went along, ſaw that terrible Apparition come thund'ring upon h m at una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, had no other way to avoid being run
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:54446:125"/>
through with the Lance, but to throw himſelf off from his Aſs to the Ground: And then as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily getting up, he took up his Heels and ran o're the Fields ſwift as a hunted Deer, leaving his Aſs and his Baſon behind him. <hi>Don Quixote</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf thus Maſter of the Field and of the Baſon: The Miſcreant, cry'd he, who has left this Helmet, has ſhewn himſelf as prudent as the Bever, who finding himſelf hotly purſu'd by the Hunters, to ſave his Life, tears and cuts off with his Teeth that for which his natural Inſtinct tells him he was follow'd. Then he order'd <hi>Sancho</hi> to take up the Helmet. On my word, quoth <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> having taken it up, 'tis a ſpecial Baſon, and as well worth a Piece of Eight, as a Thief is worth a Halter. With that he gave it to his Maſter, who preſently clapt it on his Head, turning it every way to find out the Beaver or Vizor; and at laſt ſeeing it had none, doubtleſs, ſaid he, the Pagan for whom this famous Helmet was firſt made had a Head of a prodigious ſize; but the worſt is, that there's at leaſt one half of it wanting. <hi>Sancho</hi> cou'd not forbear ſmiling to hear his Maſter call the Barber's Baſon a Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, and had not his Fear daſh'd his Mirth he had certainly laugh'd out-right. What does the Fool grin at now, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote?</hi> I laugh, ſaid he, to think what a hugeous Jolt-head he muſt needs have had who was the Owner of this ſame Helmet, that looks for all the World like a Barber's Baſon. I fancy, ſaid <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> this inchanted Helmet has fallen by ſome ſtrange Accident into the hands of ſome Perſon, who not, knowing the Value of it, for the Lucre of a little Mony, finding it to be of pure Gold, melted one half, and of the other made this

Head-Peace, which as thou ſay'ſt, has ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of a Barber's Baſon. But to me, who know the Worth of it, the Metamorphoſis ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies little; for as ſoon as ever I come to ſome Town where there's an Armorer, I will have it alter'd ſo much for the better, that then even the Helmet which the God of Smiths made for the God of War, ſhall not deſerve to be compar'd with it: In the mean time I'll wear it as it is; 'tis better than nothing, and will ſerve at leaſt to ſave part of my Head from the violent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter of a Stone.

For after all, 'twas nothing but a Jeſt, a harmleſs Piece of Paſtime; had I look'd upon it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, I had return'd to that Place before this Time, and had made more noble Miſchief, in Revenge of the Abuſe, than ever the incens'd <hi>Grecians</hi> did at <hi>Troy,</hi> for the Detenſion of their <hi>Helen;</hi> that fam'd Beauty of the ancient World, who however had ſhe liv'd in our Age, or had my <hi>Dulcinea</hi> adorn'd her's, wou'd have found her Charms out-rivall'd by my Cavelier Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe's Perfections. And ſaying this, he heav'd up a deep Sigh. Well then, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I'll not rip up old Sores: Let it go for a Jeſt, ſince there's no revenging it in Earneſt. But what ſhall we do with this Dapple-grey Steed, that's ſo like an Aſs? You ſee that ſome poor Devil-Errant has left it to ſhift for it ſelf, poor Thing; and by his haſte to rub off, I don't think he means to come back for it, and by my Beard, the grey Beaſt is a ſpecial one. 'Tis not my Cuſtom, reply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> to plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe whom I over-come; nor is it uſual a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us Knights, for the Victor to take the Horſe of his vanquiſh'd Enemy, and let him go a Foot, unleſs his own Steed be kill'd or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled in the Combate. Therefore <hi>Sancho,</hi> leave the Horſe or the Aſs, whatever thou pleaſeſt to call it; the Owner will be ſure to come for't, as ſoon as he'll ſee us gone. I've a huge mind
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:54446:126"/>
to take him along with us, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> or at leaſt to exchange him for my own which is not ſo good. What, are the Laws of Knight-Erran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſo ſtrict, that a Man muſt not exchange one Aſs for another? At leaſt, I hope they'll give me leave to ſwop one Harneſs for another? Truly, <hi>Sancho,</hi> reply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> I am not ſo very certain as to this laſt Particular; and therefore, till I am better inform'd, I give thee leave to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change the Furniture, if thou haſt abſolutely oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for't. I've ſo much occaſion for't, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that tho' 'twere for my own very ſelf I cou'd not need it more. So without any more ado, being authoriz'd by his Maſter's leave, he made <hi>Mutatio Caprarum,</hi> and his own Aſs as fine, as if it had had a hundred Holy-day-Cloaths on its Back. This done, they Breakfaſted upon what they left at Supper, having quench'd their Thirſt at the Stream that turn'd the Fulling-Mills, towards which <hi>Don Quixote</hi> took care not to caſt an Eye, for he abominated the very Thoughts of 'em. Thus their Spleen being eas'd, their choleric and melancholic Humors aſſuag'd, up they got again, and never minding their Way, they were all guided by <hi>Rozinante</hi>'s Diſcretion, the Depoſitory of his Maſter's Will, and alſo of the Aſs's, that kindly and ſociably always fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd his Steps where-ever he went. Their Guide ſoon brought 'em again into the high Road, where they kept on a ſlow Pace, not caring which way they went.</p>
                           <p>As they jogg'd on thus, quoth <hi>Sancho</hi> to his Maſter, Pray, Sir, will you give me leave to talk to you a little? For ſince you have laid that bitter Command upon me, to hold my Tongue, I've had four or five quaint Conceits, that have rotted in my Gizard; and now I've
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:54446:127"/>
another at my Tongue's end, that I would not for any thing ſhould miſcarry. Say it, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> but be ſhort; for no Diſcourſe can pleaſe, when too long.</p>
                           <p>Well then, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I've been thinking to my ſelf of late how little is to be got by hunting up and down theſe barren Woods and ſtrange Places, where tho' you compaſs the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt dangerous Jobs of Knight-Errantry, yet no living Soul ſees it, or hears on't, and ſo 'tis every whit as good as loſt, and therefore me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks 'twere better (with Submiſſion to your Worſhip's better Judgment be it ſpoken) that we e'en went to ſerve ſome Emperor or other great Prince that's at War. For there you might ſhow how ſtout, and how wondrous ſtrong and wiſe you be; which being perceiv'd by the Lord we ſhall ſerve, he muſt needs reward us, every one according to his Deſerts, and there you'll not want a learned Scholar to ſet down all your high Deeds, that they may never be forgotten: As for mine I ſay nothing, ſeeing they are not to be nam'd the ſame day with your Worſhip's; and yet I dare avouch that if any Notice be taken in Knight-Errantry of the Feats of Squires, mine will be ſure to come in for a Share. Truly, <hi>Sancho,</hi> reply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> there is ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in what thou ſay'ſt. But firſt of all, 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that a Knight-Errant ſhould ſpend ſome Time in various Parts of the World as a Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner in queſt of Adventures, that by atchieving ſome extraordinary Exploits, his Renown may diffuſe it ſelf through neighbouring Climes and diſtant Nations. So when he goes to the Court of ſome great Monarch, his Fame flying before him as his Harbinger, ſecures him ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, that the Knight has ſcarce reach'd the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:54446:127"/>
Gates of the Metropolis of the Kingdom, when he finds himſelf attended and ſurrounded by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring Crouds, pointing and crying out, There rides the Knight of the Sun, or of the Serpent, or whatever other Title the Knight takes upon him. That's he, they'll cry, who vanquiſh'd in ſingle Combat the huge Giant <hi>Brocabruno,</hi> ſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam'd <hi>Of the Invincible Strength.</hi> This is he that freed the great Sophy of <hi>Perſia</hi> from the Enchantment that had kept him confin'd for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt nine hundred Years together. Thus as they relate his Atchievements with loud Acclamations, the ſpreading Rumour at laſt reaches the King's Palace, and the Monarch being deſirous to be inform'd with his own Eyes will not fail to look out of his Window. As ſoon as he ſees the Knight, knowing him by his Arms, or the <hi>Deviſe</hi> on his Shield, he'll be oblig'd to ſay to his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, My Lords and Gentlemen, haſte, all of you, as many as are Knights, go and receive the Flower of Chivalry that's coming to our Court. At the King's Command away they all run to introduce him, the King himſelf meets him half way on the Stairs, where he embraces his valorous Gueſt, and kiſſes his Cheek. Then taking him by the Hand he leads him directly to the Queen's Apartment; where the Knight finds her attended by the Princeſs her Daughter, who ought to be one of the moſt beautiful and moſt accompliſh'd Damſels in the whole compaſs of the Univerſe. At the ſame time Fate will ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe every Thing that the Knight ſhall gaze on the Princeſs and the Princeſs on the Knight, and each ſhall admire one another as Perſons rather Angelical than Humane; and then by an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable Charm they ſhall both find themſelves caught and entangled in the inextricable N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:54446:128"/>
Love, and wondrouſly perplex'd for want of an opportunity to diſcover their amorous Anguiſh to one another.</p>
                           <p>After this doubtleſs the Knight is conducted by the King to one of the richeſt Appartments in the Palace, where having taken off his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, they will bring him a rich Scarlet Veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lin'd with Ermines; and if he look'd ſo graceful cas'd in Steel, how lovely will he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in all the heightning Ornaments of Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers? Night being come, he ſhall ſup with the King, the Queen, and the Princeſs, and ſhall all the while be Feaſting his Eyes with the Sight of his Charmer, yet ſo as no Body ſhall perceive it; and ſhe will repay him his Glances with as much Diſcretion; for as I have ſaid, ſhe is a moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd Perſon. After Supper, a ſurpriſing Scene is unexpectedly to appear: Enter firſt an ill-favour'd little Dwarf, and after him a fair Damſel between two Giants, with the Offer of a certain Adventure ſo contriv'd by an ancient Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gromancer, and ſo difficult to be perform'd, that he who ſhall undertake and end it with Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, ſhall be eſteem'd the beſt Knight in the World. Preſently 'tis the King's Pleaſure that all his Courtiers ſhould attempt it; which they do, but all of 'em unſucceſsfully, for the Honour is reſerv'd for the valorous Stranger, who effects that with Eaſe which the reſt eſſay'd in vain. And then the Princeſs ſhall be overjoy'd, and eſteem herſelf the moſt happy Creature in the World, for having beſtow'd her Affections on ſo deſerving an Object. Now by the happy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of Fate, this King, or this Emperor is at War with one of his Neighbours as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as himſelf; and the Knight being inform'd of this, after he has been ſome few Days at Court,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:54446:128"/>
he offers the King his Service, which is accepted with Joy, and the Knight courteouſly kiſſes the King's Hands in Acknowledgment of ſo great a Favour. That Night the Lover takes his Leave of the Princeſs at the Iron-grate before her Chamber-Window looking into the Garden, where he and ſhe have already had ſeveral Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>views by means of the Princeſs's Confident, a Damſel who carries on the Intriegue between 'em. The Knight ſighs, the Princeſs ſwoons, the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel runs for cold Water to bring her to Life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, very uneaſy alſo becauſe the Morning-Light approaches, and ſhe wou'd not have them diſcovered, leſt it ſhould reflect on her Lady's Honour. At laſt the Princeſs revives, and gives the Knight her lovely Hand to kiſs, which he does a thouſand and a thouſand Times, bathing it all the while with his Tears. Then they agree how to tranſmit their Though<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>s with Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy to each other, by a mutual Intercourſe of Letters during this fatal abſence. The Princeſs prays him to return with all the ſpeed of a Lover; the Knight promiſes it with repeated Vows, and a thouſand kind Proteſtations. At laſt, the fatal moment being come that muſt tear him from all he loves and from his very ſelf, he ſeals once more his Leave on her ſoft, ſnowy Hand, almoſt breathing out his Soul, which mounts to his Lips, and even would leave its Body to dwell there, and then he is hurried away by the fearful Confident.</p>
                           <p>After this cruel Separation, he retires to his Chamber, throws himſelf on his Bed, but Grief will not ſuffer Sleep to cloſe his Eyes: Then riſing with the Sun, he goes to take his Leave of the King, and of the Queen; he deſires to pay his Complement of Leave to the Princeſs, but
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:54446:129"/>
he is told, ſhe is indiſpoſed; and as he has rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe that his departing is the Cauſe of her Diſorder, he is ſo griev'd at the News, that he is ready to betray the Secret of his Heart, which the Princeſs's Confident obſerving, ſhe goes and acquaints her with it, and finds the lovely Mourner bath'd in Tears, who tells her, that the greateſt Affliction of her Soul, is, her not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether her charming Knight be of Royal Blood: But the Damſel pacifies her, aſſuring her that ſo much Valour, ſo much Gallantry, and ſuch noble Qualifications were unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deriv'd from an Illuſtrious and Royal Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal. This comforts the afflicted Fair, who does all ſhe can to compoſe her Looks, leſt the King or the Queen ſhou'd ſuſpect the Cauſe of their Alteration; and ſo ſome Days after, ſhe appears in Publick as before.</p>
                           <p>And now the Knight, having been abſent for ſome Time, meets, fights and overcomes the King's Enemies, takes I don't know how many Cities, wins I don't know how many Battles, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to Court, and appears before his Miſtreſs Jaden with Honour. He Viſits her privately as before, and they agree, that he ſhall demand her of the King her Father in Marriage, as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of all his Services. But the King will not grant his Suit, as being unacquainted with his Birth: However, whether it be that the Princeſs ſuffers her ſelf to be privately carried away, or that ſome other Means are us'd, the Knight Marries her, and in a little Time the King is very well pleaſed with the Match, for now the Knight appears to be the Son of a mighty King of I can't tell you what Country, for I think 'tis not in the Map. Sometime after, the Father dies, the Princeſs is Heireſs, and thus
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:54446:129"/>
in a Trice our Knight comes to be King. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus compleated his Happineſs, his next Thoughts are to gratify his Squire, and all thoſe who have been inſtrumental in his advancement to the Throne: Thus he marries his Squire to one of the Princeſs's Damſels, and moſt probably to her Favorite who had been familiar to their Amours, and who is Daughter to one of the moſt conſiderable Dukes in the Kingdom.</p>
                           <p>That's what I've been looking for all this while, quoth <hi>Sancho:</hi> Give me but that, and let the World rub; there I'll ſtick. For every Tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle o' this will come to paſs, and be your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Caſe as ſure as a Gun, if you'll but take upon ye that ſame Nick-name of the <hi>Knight of the Woful Countenance.</hi> Moſt certainly, <hi>Sancho,</hi> replied <hi>Don Quixote;</hi> for by the ſame Steps, and in that very manner, Knights-Errant have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways proceeded to aſcend to the Throne. Therefore our chief Buſineſs is to find out ſome great Potentate either among the Chriſtians or the Pagans, that is at War with his Neighbours, and has a fair Daughter. But we ſhall have Time enough to enquire after that; for, as I have told thee, we muſt firſt purchaſe Fame in other Places, before we preſume to go to Court. Another Thing makes me more uneaſy; Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we have found out a King and a Princeſs, and I have fill'd the World with the Fame of my unparallell'd Atchievements, what hopes can I have of ever being diſcover'd to be of Royal Blood, tho' it were but ſecond Couſin to an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror? For 'tis not to be expected that the King will ever conſent that I ſhall wed his Daughter, till I have made this out by Authentick Proofs, tho' my Service deſerve it never ſo much. And thus for want of a Punctilio, I am in danger of
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:54446:130"/>
loſing what my Valour ſo juſtly merits. 'Tis true indeed I am a Gentleman, and of a noted ancient Family, nay, perhaps the learned Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographer who is to write the Hiſtory of my Life, will ſo improve and beautify my Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, that he will find me to be the fifth or ſixth at leaſt in Deſcent from a King. For, <hi>Sancho,</hi> there are two ſorts of Originals in the World. Some, who ſprung from mighty Kings and Princes, by little and little have been ſo leſſen'd and obſcur'd, that the Eſtates and Titles of the following Generations have dwindled to nothing, and ended in a Point like a Pyramid. Others, who from mean and low Beginnings ſtill riſe and riſe, till at laſt they are rais'd to the very Top of Human Greatneſs. So vaſt the difference is, That thoſe who were Something are now No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and thoſe that were Nothing, are now Something; and therefore who knows but that I may be one of thoſe whoſe Original is ſo illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious; which being handſomly made out, after due Examination, ought undoubtedly to ſatisfy the King my Father-in-Law: But even ſuppoſing he were ſtill refractory, the Princeſs is to be ſo deſperately in Love with me, that ſhe will marry me without his Conſent, tho' I were the Son of a the meaneſt <hi>Plebeian;</hi> and if her tender Honour ſcruples to bleſs me againſt her Father's Will, then it may not be amiſs to put a pleaſing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint upon her, by conveying her by Force out of the Reach of her Father, to whoſe Perſecutions either Time or Death will be ſure to put a Period.</p>
                           <p>Ay, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> your rakehelly Fellows have a Saying that's pat to your purpoſe, <hi>Ne'er cringe nor creep for what you by force may reap:</hi> Tho' I think 'twere better ſaid, <hi>The Leap of a Shrub is worth more than good Mens Prayers.</hi> No more to be ſaid, if
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:54446:130"/>
the King your Father-in-Law won't let you have his Daughter by fair means, ne'er ſtand Shall I, Shall I, but fairly and ſquarely run away with her. All the Miſchief that I fear is only, that while you're making your Peace with him, and waiting after a dead Man's Shooes, as the Saying is, the poor Dog of a Squire is like to go long bare-foot, and may go hang himſelf for any good you'll be able to do him, unleſs the Damſel <hi>Go between,</hi> who's to be his Wife, run away too with the Princeſs, and he ſolace himſelf with her, till a better time comes; for I don't ſee but that the Knight may clap up the Match between us without any more ado. That's moſt certain, anſwer'd <hi>Don Quixote.</hi> Why then, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> happy be lucky, over Shooes over Boots; let's e'en take our Chance, and let the World rub. May Fortune crown our Wiſhes, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> and let him be a Wretch who thinks himſelf one. Amen, ſay I, quoth <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho;</hi> for I'm one of your old Chriſtians, and that's enough to have me be an Earl. And more than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, ſaid <hi>Don Quixote;</hi> for tho' thou wer't not ſo well deſcended, being a King I cou'd beſtow Nobility on thee, without putting thee to the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of buying it, or of doing me the leaſt Service; and making thee an Earl, Men muſt call thee My Lord, tho' it grieve 'em never ſo much. And do you think, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I wou'd become not my <hi>Equality</hi> main well? Thou ſhould'ſt ſay Quality, ſaid <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> and not <hi>Equality.</hi> Ev'n as you will, return'd <hi>Sancho:</hi> But, as I was ſaying, I ſhould become an Earldom rarely; for I was once Beadle to a Brotherhood, and the Beadle's Gown did ſo become me, that every Body ſaid I had the Preſence of a Warden. Then howd you think I'll look with a Duke's Robes on my Back, all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dawb'd with Gold and Pearl like any Foreign

Count? I believe we ſhall have Folks come a 100 Leagues to ſee me. Thou wilt look well enough, ſaid <hi>Don Quixote;</hi> but then thou muſt ſhave that rough buſhy Beard of thine at leaſt ev'ry other day, or People will read thy Beginning in thy Face as ſoon as they ſee thee. Why then, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> 'tis but keeping a Barber in my Houſe; and if needs be, he ſhall trot after me where-ever I go, like a Grandee's Maſter of the Horſe. How cam'ſt thou to know, ſaid <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> that Grandees have their Maſters of the Horſe to ride after 'em? I'll tell you, quoth <hi>Sancho:</hi> Some years ago I happen'd to be about a Month among your Court-folks, and there I ſaw a little Dandiprat riding about, who, they ſaid, was a hugeous great Lord; there was a Man a Horſeback that follow'd him cloſe where-ever he went, like a little <hi>t'anthony</hi> Pig, turning and ſtopping as he did, you'd have thought he had been ty'd to his Horſe's Tail. With that I ask'd why that hind-man did not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees have always ſuch kind of Men at their Tail; and I mark'd this ſo well that I ha'n't forgot it ſince. Thou art in the right, ſaid <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> and thou may'ſt as reaſonably have thy Barber at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend thee in this manner: Cuſtoms did not come up all at once, but rather ſtarted up and were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd by Degrees; ſo thou mayſt be the firſt Ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Well, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> leave the Buſineſs of the Cut beard to me, and do but take Care you be a King, and I an Earl.

They were guarded by two Horſemen, arm'd with Carabines, and two Men a Foot, with Swords and Javelins. As ſoon as <hi>Sancho</hi> ſpy'd 'em, look ye, Sir, cry'd he, here's a Gang of Criminals hurried away by main Force to ſerve the King in the Gallies. How, reply'd <hi>Don Quixote!</hi> Is it poſſible that the King will force any Body? I don't ſay ſo, anſwer'd <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho;</hi> I mean theſe are Rogues whom the Law has ſentenc'd for their Miſdeeds, to row in the King's Gallies. However, reply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> they are forc'd, becauſe they do not go of their own free Will. Sure enough, quoth <hi>Sancho.</hi> If it be ſo, ſaid <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> they come within the Verge of my Office, which is to hinder Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Oppreſſion, and ſuccour all People in Miſery. Ay, Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but neither the King nor the Law offer any Violence to ſuch
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:54446:132"/>
wicked Wretches, they have but their Deſerts. By this, the Chain drew near, and then <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> in very civil Terms, deſir'd the Guards to inform him why theſe poor People were led along in that manner? Sir, anſwer'd one of the Horſemen, they are Criminals condemn'd to ſerve the King in his Gallies. That's all I've to ſay to you, and you need enquire no further. Nevertheleſs, Sir, reply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> I have a great deſire to know in few Words the Cauſe of their Misfortune, and I will eſteem it an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Favour if you will let me have that Satisfaction.

What, only for being in Love, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote!</hi> Were all thoſe that are in Love to be thus us'd, I my ſelf might have been long ſince in the Gallies. Ay, but reply'd the Slave, my Love was not of that ſort which you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture: I was ſo deſperately in Love with a Basket of Linnen, and embrac'd it ſo cloſe, that had not the Judge taken it from me by Force, I wou'd not have parted with it willingly. In ſhort, I was taken in the Fact, and ſo there was no need to put me to the Rack, 'twas prov'd ſo plain upon me. So I was committed, try'd,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:54446:132"/>
condemn'd, had the gentle Laſh; and beſides that, was ſent for three Years to be an Element-Daſher, and there's an end of the Buſineſs. An Element-Daſher, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> what do you mean by that? A Gally-Slave, anſwer'd the Criminal, who was a young Fellow, about four and twenty Years old, and ſaid he was born at <hi>Piedra Hita.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Then <hi>Don Quixote</hi> examin'd the ſecond, but he was ſo ſad and deſponding, that he wou'd make no anſwer; however, the firſt Rogue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd the Knight of his Affairs: Sir, ſaid he, this <hi>Canary Bird</hi> keeps us Company for having ſung too much. Is't poſſible, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote!</hi> Are Men ſent to the Gallies for Singing? Ay, marry, are they, quoth the arch Rogue; for there's nothing worſe than to ſing in Anguiſh. How, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote!</hi> That contradicts the Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Sing away Sorrow, caſt away Care.</hi> Ay, but with us, the Caſe is alter'd, reply'd the Slave, he that Sings in Diſaſter, Weeps all his Life af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. This is a Riddle which I cannot unfold, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote.</hi> Sir, ſaid one of the Guards, <hi>Singing in Anguiſh,</hi> among theſe Jail-Birds, means to confeſs upon the Rack: This Fellow was put to the Torture, and confeſs'd his Crime, which was ſtealing of Cattle; and becauſe he <hi>tatled</hi> or <hi>ſung,</hi> as they call it, he was condemn'd to the Gallies for ſix Years; beſides a hundred Jirks with a Cat a'nine Tails, that have whisk'd and powder'd his Shoulders already. Now the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why he goes thus moapiſh and out o' ſorts, is only becauſe his Comrogues jeer and laugh at him continually for not having had the Courage to deny: As if it had not been as eaſie for him to have ſaid <hi>No</hi> as <hi>Yes;</hi> or as if a Fellow, taken up on Suſpicion, were not a lucky Rogue
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:54446:133"/>
when there is no poſitive Evidence can come in againſt him but his own Tongue; and in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion they're ſomewhat in the right. I think ſo too, ſaid <hi>Don Quixote.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thence addreſſing himſelf to the third, and you, ſaid he, what have you done? Sir, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd the Fellow readily and pleaſantly enough, I muſt Mow the great Meadow for five Years together, for want of twice five Ducates. I will give twenty with all my heart, ſaid <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> to deliver thee from that Miſery. Thank you for nothing, quoth the Slave; 'tis juſt like the Proverb, <hi>After Meat comes Muſtard;</hi> or, like Mony to a ſtarving Man at Sea, where there are no Victuals to be bought with it: Had I had the twenty Ducates you offer me before I was try'd, to have greas'd the Clark's [or the Recorder's] Fiſt, and have whetted my Lawyer's Wit, I might have been now at <hi>Toledo</hi> in the Place of <hi>Zocodover,</hi> and not have been thus led along like a Dog in a String. But Heaven is powerful, <hi>Baſta;</hi> I ſay no more.</p>
                           <p>Then paſſing to the fourth, who was a vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable old Don, with a grey Beard that reach'd to his Boſom, he put the ſame Queſtion to him; whereupon the poor Creature fell a weeping, and was not able to give him an anſwer: So the next behind him lent him a Tongue. Sir, ſaid he, this honeſt Perſon goes to the Gallies for four Years, having already taken his Progreſs through the Town in ſtate, and reſted at the uſual Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. I'll be whip'd, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> if that ben't to do Penance at the Croſs, and wear the wooden Ruff at the Pillo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>y. Right, Gaffor, quoth the Slave; and all this he's condemn'd to for being a Broker of Human Fleſh; for to tell you the truth, the Gentleman is a Pimp, and beſides that; he has
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:54446:133"/>
a ſmack of Conjuring. If it were not for that addition of Conjuring, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> he ought not to have been ſent to the Gallies, purely for being a Pimp, unleſs it were to be General of the Gallies. For the Profeſſion of a Bawd, Pimp or Meſſenger of Love, is not like other common Employments, but an Office that requires a great deal of Prudence and Sagacity; an Office of Truſt and Weight, and moſt highly neceſſary in a well regulated Common-wealth; nor ſhould it be executed but by civil well deſcended Perſons of good natural Parts, and of a liberal Education. Nay, 'twere requiſite there ſhould be a Controuler and Surveyor of the Profeſſion, as there are of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and a certain and ſettled number of 'em as there is of Exchange-Brokers. This wou'd be a means to prevent an infinite number of Miſchiefs that happen ev'ry day, becauſe the Trade or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is follow'd by poor ignorant Pretenders, ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waiting Women, young giddy brain'd Pages, ſhallow Footmen, and ſuch raw unexperienced ſort of People, who in unexpected Turns and Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies ſuffer themſelves to be ſurpriz'd and ſpoil all for want of quickneſs of Invention either to conceal, carry on, or bring off a Thing artificially. Had I but time I wou'd point out what ſort of Perſons are beſt qualified to be choſen Profeſſors of this moſt neceſſary Employment in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth; however, at ſome fitter Seaſon I will inform thoſe of it who may remedy this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order. All I have to ſay now, is, That the Grief I had to ſee theſe venerable grey Hairs in ſuch Diſtreſs, for having follow'd that no leſs uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than ingenious Vocation of Pimping, is now loſt in my abhorrence of his additional Character of a Conjurer; tho' I very well know that no Sorcory in the World can affect or force the Will,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:54446:134"/>
as ſome ignorant credulous Perſons fondly imagin. For our Will is a free Agent, and no Herb nor Charms can conſtrain it. As for the Philtres and ſuch like Compoſitions, which ſome ſilly Women and deſigning Pretenders make, they are nothing but certain Mixtures and poyſonous Preparations, that make thoſe who take them run mad; tho' the Deceivers labour to perſuade us they can make one Perſon love another; which, as I've ſaid, is an impoſſible thing, our Will being a free uncontroulable Power. You ſay very well, Sir, cry'd the old Coupler; and upon my Honour, I proteſt I am wholly innocent, as to the Imputation of Witchcraft. As for the Buſineſs of Pimping, I cannot deny it; but I never took it to be a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Function; for my Intention was, that all Mankind ſhould taſte the Sweets of Love, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy each other's Society, living together in Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and in Peace, free from thoſe Griefs and Jars that unpeople the World. But my harmleſs De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign has not been ſo happy as to prevent my being ſent now to a place whence I never expect to return, ſtooping as I do under the heavy Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of old Age, and being grievouſly afflicted with the Strangary, which ſcarce affords me a Moment's reſpite from Pain. This ſaid, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Procurer burſt out afreſh into Tears and Lamentations, which melted <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Heart ſo much, that he pull'd a piece of Mony out of his Boſom and gave it to him as an Alms.</p>
                           <p>Then <hi>Don Quixote</hi> turn'd to the fifth, who ſeem'd to be nothing at all concern'd. I go to ſerve his Majeſty, ſaid he, for having been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what too familiar with two of my Cozen-Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, and two other kind-hearted Virgins that were Siſters: By which means I have multiplied my Kind, and begot ſo odd and intricate a Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:54446:134"/>
of Kindred, that 'twould puzzle a Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Caſuiſts to reſolve their Degrees of Conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity. All this was proved upon me. I had no Friends, and what was worſe, no Mony, and ſo was like to have ſwung for't: However, I was only condemn'd to the Gallies for ſix Years, and patiently ſubmitted to't. I feel my ſelf yet young, to my Comfort; ſo if my Life does but hold out, all will be well in time. If you will be pleas'd to beſtow ſomething upon poor Sinners, Heaven will reward you; and when we Pray, we will be ſure to remember you, that your Life may be as long and proſperous as your Preſence is goodly and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. This brisk Spark appear'd to be a Student and was a great Talker, and a good Latiniſt.</p>
                           <p>After him came a Man about thirty Years old, a clever, well ſet, handſom Fellow, only he ſquinted horribly with one Eye; he was ſtrangely loaded with Irons: A heavy Chain clogg'd his Leg, and was ſo long that he twiſted it about his Waſte like a Girdle; he had a couple of Collars about his Neck, the one to link him to the reſt of the Slaves; and the other, one of thoſe Iron Ruffs which they call a <hi>Keep-Friend,</hi> or a Friend's Foot; from whence two Irons went down to his Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and to their two Bars were rivitted a pair of Manacles that grip'd him by the Fiſts, and were ſecured with a large Pad-lock; ſo that he could neither lift his Hands to his Mouth, nor bend down his Head towards his Hands. <hi>Don Quixote</hi> enquiring why he was worſe hamper'd with Irons than the reſt? Becauſe he alone has done more Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueries than all the reſt, anſwer'd one of the Guards. This is ſuch a Reprobate, ſuch a Devil of a Fellow, that no Goal nor Fetters will hold him; we are not ſure he's faſt enough, for all he's chain'd ſo. What ſort of Crimes then has be been
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:54446:135"/>
guiltty of, ask'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> that he is only ſent to the Gallies? Why, anſwer'd the Keeper, he is condemn'd to ten Years Slavery, which is no better than a Civil Death. But I need not ſtand to tell you any more of him, but that he is that notorious Rogue <hi>Gines de Paſſamonte,</hi> alias <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillo de Parapilla.</hi> Hark you, Sir, cry'd the Slave, fair and ſoftly; what a pox makes you give a Gentleman more Names than he has? <hi>Gines</hi> is my Chriſtian-name, and <hi>Paſſamonte</hi> my Sir-name; and not <hi>Gineſillo,</hi> nor <hi>Parapilla</hi> as you ſay. Blood, let every Man mind what he ſays, or it may prove the worſt for him. Don't you be ſo ſawcy, Mr. Crack-rope, cry'd the Officer to him, or I may chance to make you keep a better Tongue in your Head. 'Tis a ſign, cry'd the Slave, that a Man's faſt and under the Laſh, but one day or other ſome body ſhall know whether I'm called <hi>Parapilla</hi> or no. Why, Mr. Slip-ſtring, reply'd the Officer, do not People call you by that Name? They do, anſwer'd <hi>Gines,</hi> but I'll make 'em call me other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, or I'll fleece and bite 'em worſe than I care to tell you now. But, you, Sir, who are ſo inquiſitive, added he, turning to <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> if you've a mind to g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I am <hi>Gines de Paſſamonte,</hi> I am not aſham'd of my Name. As for my Life and Converſation, there's an Account of 'em in Black and White, written with this numerical H <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>d of mine. There he tells you true, ſaid the Officer; for he has writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his own Hiſtory himſelf, without omitting a Tittle of his Roguiſh Pranks; and he has left the Manuſcript in Pawn in the Priſon for two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Reals.</hi> Ay, ſaid <hi>Gines,</hi> and will redeem it, burn me, 'tho' it lay there for as many Ducats.
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:54446:135"/>
Then it muſt be an extraoadinary Piece, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote.</hi> So extraordinary, reply'd <hi>Gines,</hi> that it far out-does not only <hi>Lazarillo de Tormes,</hi> but whatever has been and ſhall be written in that kind. For mine's true every Word, and no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented Stories can compare with it for variety of Tricks and Accidents. What's the Title of the Book, ask'd <hi>Don Quixote? The Life of</hi> Gines de Paſſamonte, anſwer'd t'other. Is it quite finiſh'd, ask'd the Knight? How the Devil can it be finiſh'd and I yet living, reply'd the Slave? There's in it every material Point from my Cradle, to this my laſt going to the Gallies. Then it ſeems you have been there before, ſaid <hi>Don Quixote.</hi> I was only ſome four Years there once before, reply'd <hi>Gines:</hi> I already know how the Bisket and the Bull's Piz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle agree with my Carcaſs: It does not grieve me much to go there again, for there I ſhall have lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to give a finiſhing Stroke to my Book. I have the Devil knows what to add; and in our Spaniſh Gallies there is always Leiſure and idle Time enough o' Conſcience: Neither ſhall I want ſo much for what I've to inſert, for I know it all by Heart.</p>
                           <p>Thou ſeemſt to be a witty Fellow, ſaid <hi>Don Quixote.</hi> You ſhould have ſaid unfortunate too, reply'd the Slave; for the Bitch Fortune is ſtill unkind to Men of Wit. You mean to ſuch wicked Wretches as your ſelf, cry'd the Officer. Look you, Mr. Commiſſary, ſaid <hi>Gines,</hi> I have already deſired you to uſe good Language; the Law did not give us to your keeping for you to abuſe us, but only to conduct us where the King has occaſion for us. Let every Man mind his own Buſineſs, and give good Words or hold his Tongue; for by the Blood—I'll ſay no more; Murther will out; there will be a Time when ſome People's Rogueries
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:54446:136"/>
may come to Light, as well as thoſe of other Folks. With that the Officer, provok'd by the Slave's Threats, held up his Staff to ſtrike him. But <hi>Don Quixote</hi> ſtep'd between 'em, and deſired him not to do it, and to conſider that the Slave was the more to be excus'd for being too free of his Tongue, ſince he had ne'er another Member at Liberty. Then addreſſing himſelf to all the Slaves, My deareſt Brethren, cry'd he, I find, by what I gather from your own Words, that tho' you deſerve Puniſhment for the ſeveral Crimes of which you ſtand convicted, yet you ſuffer Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sentence by Conſtraint, and meerly becauſe you cannot help it. Beſides, 'tis not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely but that this Man's want of Reſolution up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Rack, the other's want of Mony, the third's want of Friends and Favour, and in ſhort the Judges perverting and wreſting the Law to your great Prejudice, may have been the cauſe of your Miſery. Now, as Heaven has ſent me into the World to relieve the Diſtreſs'd, and free ſuffering Weakneſs from the Tyranny of Oppreſſion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Duty of my Profeſſion of Knight-Errantry, theſe Conſiderations induce me to take you under my Protection—But becauſe 'tis the part of a prudent Man not to uſe Violence where fair Means may be effectual, I deſire you, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Guard, to releaſe theſe poor Men, there being People enough to ſerve his Majeſty in their rooms; for 'tis a hard Caſe to make Slaves of Men that were born free; and you have the leſs Reaſon to uſe theſe Wretches with Severity, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they never did you any wrong. Let 'em an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for their Sins in the other World; Heaven is juſt, you know, and will beſure to puniſh the Wicked as 'twill certainly reward the Good. Conſider beſides Gentlemen, that 'tis neither a
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:54446:136"/>
Chriſtian like nor an honorable Action for Men to be the Butchers and Tormentors of one another; principally when no Advantage can ariſe from it. I chuſe to deſire this of you, with ſo much Mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and in ſo peaceable a manner, Gentlemen, that I may have occaſion to pay you a thankful Acknowledgment, if you will be pleas'd to grant ſo reaſonable a Requeſt. But if you provoke me by Refuſal, I muſt be oblig'd to tell ye, that this Lance and this Sword, guided by this invincible Arm, ſhall force you to yield that to my Valour which you deny to my civil Entreaties.</p>
                           <p>A very good Jeſt indeed, cry'd the Officer, what a Devil, can you dote at ſuch a Rate? Would you have us ſet at Liberty the King's Priſoners when we are leading 'em to due Puniſhment according to Law. Go, go about your Buſineſs, good Sir Errant, and ſet your Baſon right upon your empty Pate; and pray don't meddle any further in what does not concern you, for thoſe who'll play with Cats muſt expect to be ſcratch'd.</p>

We muſt rather part and ſculk ſome one way, ſome another, and lie ſnug in Creeks and Corners under Ground, for fear of theſe damn'd Manhounds that will be after us with a Hue and Cry; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all we can and ought to do in this Caſe is to change this Complement and Homage which you'd have us pay to the Lady <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo</hi> into a certain number of <hi>Ave Maries</hi> and <hi>Creeds,</hi> which we will ſay for your Benefit; and this may be done by Night or by Day, walking or ſtanding, and in War as well as in Peace. But to imagin we ſhall take up our Chains again, and lug 'em the Devil knows whither, is as unreaſonable as to think 'tis Night now at ten a Clock in the Morning. S'death, to expect this from us is to expect Pears from an Elm-Tree. Now, by my Sword, Sir Son of a Whore, Sir <hi>Geneſillo de Parapilla,</hi> or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be your Name, you ſhall go alone, creeping like a Dog under a Door, with all the Chain about your Shoulders. <hi>Gines,</hi> who was naturally very cholerick, judging by <hi>Don Quixote</hi>'s Talk and laſt

Exploit that he was not very wiſe, wink'd on his Companions, who, like Men that underſtood Signs, preſently fell back to the right and left, and pelted <hi>Don Quixote</hi> with ſuch a Shower of Stones, that all his Dexterity to cover himſelf with his Shield was now ineffectual, and poor <hi>Rozinante</hi> no more obey'd the Spur, than if he had been only the Statue of a Horſe. As for <hi>Sancho,</hi> he got behind his Aſs, and there ſhelter'd himſelf from the Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of Flints that threaten'd his Bones, while his Maſter was ſo batter'd, that in a little time he was thrown out of his Saddle to the Ground. He was no ſooner down, but the Student leap'd on him, took off the Baſon from his Head, gave him 3 or 4 Thumps o' the Shoulders with it, and then gave it ſo many knocks againſt the Stones that he almoſt broke it to pieces. After this, they ſtripp'd him of his Coat; and had robb'd him of his Hoſe too, but that his Greaves hinder'd them. They alſo eas'd <hi>Sancho</hi> of his upper Coat, and left him <hi>in Cuerpo;</hi> then having divided the Spoils, they ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every one for himſelf, thinking more how to avoid being taken up and link'd again in the Chain, than of trudging with it to my Lady <hi>Dulci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea del Toboſo.</hi> Thus the Aſs, <hi>Rozinante, Sancho</hi> and <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> remain'd indeed Maſters of the Field, but in an ill Condition.

                           <p>Now <hi>Aurora</hi> with her ſmiling Face return'd to inliven and cheer the Earth, but alas to grieve and affright <hi>Sancho</hi> with a diſmal Diſcovery: For he no ſooner open'd his Eyes but he miſs'd his Aſs, and finding himſelf depriv'd of that dear Partner of his Fortunes, and beſt Comfort in his Peregri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, he broke out into the moſt pitiful and ſad Lamentations in the World, inſomuch that he wak'd <hi>Don Quixote</hi> with his moans. O dear Child of my Bowels, cry'd he, born and bred under my roof, my Childrens Play-fellow! The Comfort of my Wife, the Envy of my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, the Eaſe of my Burdens, the Staff of my Life, and in a word half my Maintenance; for with ſix and twenty <hi>Marvedis</hi> which were daily earn'd by thee, I made ſhift to keep half my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> who eaſily gueſt the Cauſe of theſe Complaints, ſtrove to comfort him with kind condoling Words, and learned Diſcourſes upon the uncertainty of human Happineſs. But nothing prov'd ſo effectual to aſſuage his ſorrow, as the promiſe which his Maſter made him of drawing a Bill of Exchange on his Niece for three Aſſes out of five which he had at home, payable to <hi>Sancho Pancha</hi> or his Order; which prevailing Argument ſoon dry'd up his Tears, huſh'd his Sighs and Moans, and turn'd his Complaints in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thanks to his generous Maſter for ſo unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Favour.</p>
                           <p>And now as they wandred further in theſe Mountains, <hi>Don Quixote</hi> was tranſported with joy, to find himſelf where he might flatter his Ambition with the hopes of freſh Adventures to ſignalize his Valour; for theſe vaſt Deſarts made
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:54446:141"/>
him call to mind the wonderful Exploits of other Knights-Errant perform'd in ſuch Solitudes. Fill'd with thoſe airy Notions, he thought on nothing elſe: But <hi>Sancho</hi> was for more ſubſtantial Food; and now thinking himſelf quite out of the reach of the holy Brotherhoods purſuit, his only care was to fill his Belly with the Relicks of the Clerical Booty, which <hi>Rozinante</hi> was now forc'd to carry; and ſo trudging on after his Maſter, he ſlily took out, now one piece of Meat, then another, and kept his Grinders going faſter than his Feet: Thus plodding on, he wou'd not have given a Ruſh to have met with any other Adventure.</p>
                           <p>While he was thus employ'd, he obſerv'd that his Maſter endeavour'd to take up ſomething that lay on the ground with the end of his Lance; this made him run to help him to lift up the Bundle, which proved to be a Portmanteau, and the Seat of a Saddle, that were half, or rather quite, rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with lying expos'd to the Weather. The Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manteau was ſomewhat heavy; and <hi>Don Quixote</hi> having order'd <hi>Sancho</hi> to ſee what it contain'd, tho it was ſhut with a Chain and a Padlock, he eaſily ſaw what was in it thro the Cracks, and pull'd out four fine Holland Shirts, and other clean and faſhionable Linen, beſides a conſiderable quantity of Gold ty'd up in a Hankerchief: Bleſs my Eye-ſight, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> and now Heav'n I thank thee for ſending us a lucky Adventure once <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Heaven reward your Worſhip, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> kiſſing his Maſter's hand, and at the ſame time clapping up the Linnen and the other Things into the Bag where he kept the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:54446:142"/>
Victuals. I fancy, ſaid <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> that ſome Perſon having loſt his way in theſe Mountains has been met by Robbers, who have murder'd him and buried his Body ſomewhere hereabouts. Sure your Worſhip's miſtaken, anſwer'd <hi>Sancho;</hi> for had they been Highway-men, they wou'd ne'r have left ſuch a Booty behind 'em. Thou'rt in the right, reply'd <hi>Don Quixote;</hi> and therefore I cannot imagin what it muſt be. But ſtay, I will examin the Table-Book, perhaps we ſhall find ſomething written in it that will help us to diſcover what I wou'd know. With that he open'd it, and the firſt thing he found was the following rough draught of a <hi>Sonnet,</hi> fairly enough written to be read with eaſe. So he read it aloud, that <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> might know what it was as well as himſelf.</p>

                           <p>This Letter, ſaid <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> does not give us any further inſight into the Things we wou'd know; all I can infer from it is, that the Perſon that wrote it was a betray'd Lover. And ſo turning over the remaining Leaves, he found ſeveral other Letters and Verſes, ſome of which were legible, and ſome ſo ſcribbled that he could not well peruſe 'em. As for thoſe he read, he cou'd meet with nothing in 'em, but Accuſations, Complaints and Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulations, Diſtruſts and Jealouſies, Pleaſures and Diſcontents, Favours and Diſdain. And while
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:54446:143"/>
the Knight was poring in the Table-Book, <hi>Sancho</hi> was romaging the Portmanteau, and the Seat of the Saddle, with that exactneſs that he did not leave a Corner unſearch'd, nor a Seam unript, nor a ſingle Lock of Wool unpickt; for the Gold he had found, which was above a hundred Ducats, had but whetted his greedy Appetite, and made him wild for more. Yet tho this was all he cou'd find, he thought himſelf well paid for the more than Herculean Labours he had undergone: nor cou'd he now repine at his being toſs'd in a Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket; the ſtraining and griping Operation of the Balſam; the Benedictions of the Packſlaves and Leavers; the Fiſticuffs of the lewd Carrier; the Loſs of his dear Wallet, of his Cloke, and of his dearer Aſs; and all the Hunger, Thirſt, and Fatigue which he had ſuffer'd in his kind Maſter's Service. On the other ſide, the Knight of the woful Countenance ſtrangely deſir'd to know who was the Owner of the Portmanteau, gueſſing by the Verſes, the Letter, the Linen and the Gold, that he was a Perſon of Worth, whom the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain and Infidelity of his Miſtreſs had driven to deſpair. At length however he gave over the thoughts of it, diſcovering no Body thro that vaſt Deſart; and ſo he rode on, wholly guided by <hi>Rozinante</hi>'s Direction, which always made the grave ſagacious Creature chuſe the plaineſt ſmootheſt Way; the Maſter ſtill firmly believing that in thoſe woody uncultivated Fields, he ſhou'd infallibly ſtart ſome wonderful Adventure.</p>
                           <p>And indeed while theſe hopes poſſeſs'd him, he ſpy'd, upon the top of a ſtony Crag juſt before him, a Man that skip'd from Rock to Rock, over Bryars and Buſhes, with wonderful agility; he ſeem'd to him naked from the Waſte upwards,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:54446:144"/>
with a thick black Beard, his Hair long and ſtrangely tangled, his Head, Legs and Feet bare; on his Hips a pair of Breeches, that ſeem'd to be of ſad-colour'd Velvet, but ſo tatter'd and torn that they diſcover'd his Skin in many places. Theſe Particulars were obſerv'd by <hi>Don Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote</hi> while he paſt by; and he follow'd him, indeavouring to overtake him, for he preſently gueſs'd this was the Owner of the Portmanteau. But <hi>Rozinante,</hi> who was naturally ſlow and fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic, was in too weak a caſe beſides to run Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with ſo ſwift an Apparition: Yet the Knight of the woful Countenance reſolv'd to find out that unhappy Creature, tho he were to beſtow a whole year in the ſearch. And to that intent he order'd <hi>Sancho</hi> to beat one ſide of the Mountain while he hunted on the other. In good ſooth, quoth <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> your Worſhip muſt excuſe me as to that; for if I but offer to ſtir an inch from you, I'm al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt frighted out of my ſeven Senſes: and let this ſerve you hereafter for a warning, that you mayn't ſend me a Nail's breadth from your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.

                           <p>Odſnigs, Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I had rather get out of his way; for ſhou'd we chance to meet him, and he lay claim to the Portmanteau, 'tis a
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:54446:144"/>
plain Caſe I ſhall be forc'd to part with the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: and therefore I think 'tis much better, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making ſo much ado, to let me keep it <hi>bony fide,</hi> till we can light on the right Owner ſome more eaſy way, and without dancing after him, which mayhap mayn't happen till we have ſpent all the Mony, and in that Caſe I'm free from the Law, and he may go whiſtle for't. Thou art miſtaken, <hi>Sancho,</hi> cry'd <hi>Don Quixote;</hi> for, ſeeing we have ſome reaſon to think that we know who is the Owner, we are bound in Conſcience to endeavour to find him out, and reſtore it to him; the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe, ſhou'd we not now ſtrive to meet him, yet the ſtrong preſumption we have that the Goods belong to him, wou'd make us poſſeſſors of 'em <hi>malà fide,</hi> and make us as guilty, as if the Party whom we ſuſpect to have loſt the Things were really the right Owner. Therefore, Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> do not think much of ſearching for him, ſince if we find him out 'twill extremely eaſe my mind. With that he ſpurr'd <hi>Rozinante;</hi> and <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> not very well pleas'd, follow'd him, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting himſelf however with the hopes of the three Aſſes which his Maſter had promiſed him. So when they had rode over the greateſt part of the Mountain, they came to a Brook where they found a Mule lying dead, with her Saddle and Bridle about her, and her ſelf half devour'd by Beaſts and Birds of Prey: Which Diſcovery fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirm'd 'em in their ſuſpicion, that the Man who fled ſo nimbly from 'em was the Owner of the Mule and Portmanteau. Now as they paus'd and ponder'd upon this, they heard a whiſtling like that of ſome Shepherd keeping his Flocks; and preſently after, upon their left hand, they ſpy'd a great number of Goats, with an old

Herdſman after 'em on the top of the Mountain. <hi>Don Quixote</hi> call'd out to him, and deſir'd him to come down: But the Goatherd inſtead of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering him, ask'd 'em in as loud a Tone, how they came thither into thoſe Deſarts, where ſcarce any living Creatures reſorted except Goats, Wolves, and other wild Beaſts? <hi>Sancho</hi> told him they would ſatisfy him as to that point, if he wou'd come where they were. With that the Goatherd came down to 'em; and ſeeing them look upon the dead Mule, That Mule, ſaid the old Fellow, has lain in that very place this ſix months. But pray tell me, good People, have you not met the Maſter on't by the way? We have met no Body, anſwer'd <hi>Don Quixote;</hi> but we found a Portmanteau, and a Saddle-Cuſhion not far from this place. I have ſeen it too, quoth the Goatherd, but I never durſt meddle with it, nor ſo much as come anear it, for fear of ſome Miſdemeanor, leſt I ſhou'd be charg'd with hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtolen ſomewhat out of it. For who knows what might happen? the Devil is ſubtle, and ſometimes lays Baits in our way to tempt us, or Blocks to make us ſtumble. 'Tis juſt ſo with me, Gaffer, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> for I ſaw the Portmanteau too, d'ye' ſee; but the Devil a bit wou'd I come within a ſtone's throw of it. No, there I found it and there I left it e'faith. It ſhall e'en lie there ſtill for me: He that keeps another man's Dog, ſhall have nothing left him but the ſtring: and I'll be none of thoſe that ſhall hang the Bell about the Cat's Neck. Tell me, honeſt Friend, ask'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> doſt thou know who is the owner of thoſe things? All I know of the matter, anſwer'd the Goatherd, is that 'tis now ſome ſix months, little more or leſs, ſince to a certain Sheepfold,

ſome three Leagues off, there came a young well-featur'd proper Gentleman in good Clothes, and under him this ſame Mule that now lies dead here, with the Cuſhion and Cloke-bag which you ſay you met, but touch'd not. He ask'd us which was the moſt deſart and leaſt frequented part of theſe Mountains; and we told him, This where we are now. And in that we ſpoke the plain Truth; for ſhou'd you venture to go but half a League further, you wou'd hardly be able to get back again in haſte; and I marvel how you cou'd get even thus far, for there's neither High-way nor Foot-path that may direct a Man this way. Now as ſoon as the young Gentleman had heard our Anſwer, he turn'd about his Mule, and made to the place we ſhow'd him, leaving us all with a hugeous liking of his Comelineſs, and ſtrangely marvelling at his Demand, and at the haſte he made towards the middle of the Mountain. After that we heard no more of him in a good while, till one day by chance one of the Shepherds com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by, he fell upon him without ſaying why or wherefore, and beat him well-favour'dly: After that he went to the Aſs that carried our Victuals, and taking away all the Bread and Cheeſe that was there, he tripp'd back again to the Mountain with wondrous ſpeed. Hearing this, a good num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of us together reſolv'd to find him out; and when we had ſpent the beſt part of two days in the thickeſt of the Foreſt, we found him at laſt lurking in the hollow of a huge Cork-Tree, from whence he came forth to meet us as mild as cou'd be. But then he was ſo alter'd, his Face was ſo disfigur'd, wan, and Sun burnt, that had it not been for his Attire, which we made ſhift to know again, tho 'twas all in Rags and Tatters, we cou'd
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:54446:146"/>
not ha' thought it had been the ſame Man. He ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted us courteouſly, and told us in few words, mighty handſomly put together, that we were not to marvel to ſee him in that manner, for that it behov'd him ſo to do, that he might fulfil a certain Penance injoyn'd him for the great Sins he had committed. We pray'd him to tell us who he was, but he wou'd by no means do it. We likewiſe deſir'd him to let us know where we might find him, that whenſoever he wanted Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals we might bring him ſome, which we told him we wou'd be ſure to do, for otherwiſe he wou'd be ſtarv'd in that barren place; requeſting him that if he did not like of that Motion nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he wou'd at leaſtwiſe come and ask us for what he wanted, and not take it by force as he had done. He thank d us heartily for our Offer, and begg'd pardon for that Injury, and promis'd to ask it henceforwards as an Alms, without ſetting upon any one. As for his place of abode, he told us he had none certain, but where-ever night caught him, there he lay. And he ended his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with ſuch bitter Moans, that we muſt have had hearts of Flint had we not had a feeling of 'em, and kept him company therein; chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering we beheld him ſo ſtrangely alter'd from what we had ſeen him before: for as I ſaid, he was a very fine comely young Man, and by his Speech and Behaviour we cou'd gueſs him to be well born, and a Court-like ſort of a Body. Now as he was talking to us, he ſtop'd of a ſudden as if he had been ſtruck dumb, fixing his Eyes ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly on the ground; whereat we all ſtood in a maze. After he had thus ſtar'd a good while, he ſhut his Eyes, then open'd 'em again, bit his Lips, knit his Brows, clutch'd his Fiſts; and then riſing
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:54446:146"/>
from the ground, whereon he had thrown him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a little before, he flew at the Man that ſtood next to him with ſuch a fury, that if we had not pull'd him off by main force, he wou'd have bit and thump'd him to death. And all the while he cry'd out; <hi>Ah, Traitor,</hi> Ferdinand, <hi>here, here thou ſhalt pay for the Wrong thou haſt done me; I muſt rip up that falſe Heart of thine;</hi> and a deal more he added, all in the diſpraiſe of that ſame <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand.</hi> After that he flung from us without ſaying a word, leaping over the Buſhes and Brambles at ſuch a ſtrange rate, that 'twas impoſſible for us to come at him. From which we gather'd that his Madneſs comes on him by fits, and that ſome one call'd <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had done him an ill Turn, that had brought the poor young Man to this paſs. And this has been confirm'd ſince that many and many times; for when he's in his right Senſes, he'l come and beg for Victuals, and thank us for 'em with Tears: But when he's in his mad Fit, he'l beat us tho we proffer him Meat civilly. And to tell you the Truth, Sirs, added the Goatherd, I and four others, of whom two are my Men, and the other two my Friends, yeſterday agreed to look for him till we ſhould find him out, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by fair means or by force, to carry him to <hi>Almodovar</hi> Town, that's but eight Leagues off; and there we'll have him cur'd if poſſible, or at leaſt we ſhall learn what he is when he comes to his Wits, and whether he has any Friends to whom he may be ſent back. This is all I know of the Matter, and I dare aſſure you that the owner of thoſe things which you ſaw in the way, is the ſelf-ſame Body that went ſo nimbly by you; for <hi>Don Quixote</hi> had by this time acquainted the Goat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd with his having ſeen that Man skipping a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Rocks.</p>

                              <pb n="256" facs="tcp:54446:147"/>The Knight was wonderfully concern'd when he had heard the Goatherd's Story, and renew'd his Reſolution of finding out that diſtracted Wretch, whatever Time and Pains it might coſt him. But Fortune was more propitious to his Deſires than he cou'd reaſonably have expected; for juſt as they were ſpeaking they ſpy'd him right againſt the place where they ſtood, coming towards 'em out of the Cleft of a Rock, muttering ſomewhat to himſelf which they cou'd not well have underſtood had they ſtood cloſe by him, much leſs cou'd they gueſs his meaning at that diſtance. His Apparel was ſuch as has already been ſaid, only <hi>Don Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote</hi> obſerv'd, when he drew nearer, that he had on a <hi>Shamoy</hi> Waſtcoat torn in many places, which yet the Knight knew to be perfum'd with Amber; and by this, as alſo by the reſt of his Clothes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Conjectures, he judg'd him to be a Man of ſome Quality. As ſoon as the unhappy Creature came near 'em, he ſaluted 'em very civilly, but with a hoarſe Voice. <hi>Don Quixote</hi> return'd his Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and alighting from <hi>Rozinante,</hi> he accoſted him in a very graceful manner, and hugg'd him cloſe in his Arms, as if he had been one of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Acquaintance. The other, vvhom we may venture to call <hi>The ragged Knight of the Rock,</hi> as vvell as <hi>Don Quixote, The Knight of the Woful Countenance,</hi> having got looſe from that Embrace, cou'd not forbear ſtepping back a little; and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his hands on the Champion's Shoulders, he ſtood ſtaring in his Face as if he had been ſtriving to call to mind whether he had known him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; probably wondering as much to behold <hi>Don Quixote</hi>'s Countenance, Armor and ſtrange Figure, as <hi>Don Quixote</hi> did to ſee his tatter'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. But the firſt that opened his Mouth after

                           <p>THE Hiſtory relates that the Knight of the Woful Countenance liſten'd with great atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the diſaſtrous Knight of the Rock, who made him the following Complement. Truly, Sir, whoever you be (for I have not the honour to know you) I'm much oblig'd to you for your Expreſſions of Civility and Friendſhip; and I cou'd wiſh I were in a condition to convince you otherwiſe than by words of the deep ſenſe I have of 'em: but my bad Fortune leaves nothing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn for ſo many Favours but unprofitable Wiſhes. Sir, anſwer'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> I've ſo hearty a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſerve you, that I was fully reſolv'd not to depart from this Wilderneſs till I had found you out, that I might know from your ſelf, whether the Diſcontents that have urg'd you to make choice of this unuſual Courſe of Life might not admit of a Remedy; for if they do, aſſure your ſelf I will leave no means untry'd, till I have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd you that eaſe which I heartily wiſh you. Or if your Diſaſters are of that fatal kind that excludes you for ever from the hopes of Comfort or Relief, then will I mingle Sorrows with you, and by ſharing your load of Grief, help you to bear the oppreſſing weight of Affliction. For
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:54446:148"/>
'tis the only comfort of the Miſerable to have Partners in their Woes. If then good Intentions may plead Merit, or a grateful Requital, let me intreat you Sir, by that generous Nature that ſhoots thro the Gloom with which Adverſity has clouded your graceful Outſide; nay let me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure you by the darling Object of your wiſhes, to let me know who you are, and what ſtrange Misfortunes have urg'd you to withdraw from the Converſe of your fellow Creatures, to bury your ſelf alive in this horrid Solitude, where you lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger out a wretched Being, a Stranger to Eaſe, to all Mankind, and even to your very ſelf. And I ſolemnly ſwear, added <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Knighthood, of which I am an unworthy Profeſſor, that if you ſo far gratify my deſires, I will aſſiſt you to the utmoſt of my capacity, either by remedying your Diſaſter, if 'tis not paſt redreſs; or at leaſt I will become your Partner in ſorrow, and ſtrive to eaſe it by a Society in ſadneſs.</p>
                           <p>The Knight of the Rock hearing the Knight of the Woful Countenance talk at that rate, look'd upon him ſtedfaſtly for a long time, and view'd and review'd him from head to foot; and when he had gaz'd a great while upon him, Sir, cry'd he, if you have any thing to eat, for Heaven's ſake give it me, and when my Hunger is abated, I ſhall be better able to comply with your Deſires, which your great Civilities and undeſerv'd Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers oblige me to ſatisfy. <hi>Sancho</hi> and the Goat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd hearing this, preſently took out ſome Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, the one out of his Bag, the other out of his Scrip, and gave it to the Knight of the Rock to allay his hunger: and immediately the famiſh'd Foreſter fell on with that greedy haſte, that he
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:54446:148"/>
ſeem'd rather to devour than feed, for he us'd no intermiſſion between bit and bit, ſo greedily he chop'd them up. When he had aſſuag'd his vora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Appetite, he beckon'd to <hi>Don Quixote</hi> and the reſt to follow him; and after he had brought 'em to a neighboring Meadow, he laid himſelf at his eaſe on the Graſs, where the reſt of the Company ſitting down by him, neither he nor they having yet ſpoke a word ſince he fell to eating, he began in this manner.</p>
                           <p>Sir, ſaid he, If you intend to be inform'd of my Misfortunes, you muſt promiſe me beforehand, not to cut off the thread of my doleful Narration with any Queſtions, or any other Interruption; for in the very inſtant that any of you do it, I ſhall leave off abruptly, and will not afterwards go on with the Story. This Preamble put <hi>Don Quixote</hi> in mind of <hi>Sancho</hi>'s ridiculous Tale, which by his neglect in not telling the Goats, was brought to an untimely Concluſion. I only uſe this precaution, added the Knight of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ock, becauſe I wou'd be quick in my Relation; for the very remembrance of my former Misfortunes proves a new one to me, and yet I promiſe you I'll endeavour to omit nothing that's material, that you may have as full an account of my Diſaſters as I am ſenſible you deſire. Thereupon <hi>Don Quixote</hi> for himſelf and the reſt having promis'd him unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted attention, he proceeded in this manner. My Name is <hi>Cardenio,</hi> the place of my Birth one of the beſt Cities in <hi>Andaluzia;</hi> my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent noble, and my Parents wealthy. But my Misfortunes are ſo great, that they are not to be remedy'd with Wealth, and have doubtleſs fill'd my Relations with the deepeſt Sorrow. In the ſame Town dwelt the charming <hi>Lucinda,</hi> the moſt
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:54446:149"/>
beautiful Creature that ever Nature fram'd, equal in Deſcent and Fortune to my ſelf, but more happy and leſs conſtant. I lov'd, nay ador'd her almoſt from her Infancy; and from her tender years ſhe bleſt me with as kind a Return as is ſutable with the innocent Freedom of that Age. Our Parents were conſcious of that early Friendſhip; nor did they oppoſe the growth of this inoffenſive Paſſion, which they perceiv'd cou'd have no other Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences than a happy Union of our Families by Marriage; a thing which the equality of our Births and Fortunes did indeed of it ſelf almoſt invite us to. Afterwards our Loves ſo grew up with our Years, that <hi>Lucinda</hi>'s Father either judging our uſual Familiarity prejudicial to his Daughter's Honour, or for ſome other Reaſons, ſent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire me to diſcontinue my frequent viſits to his Houſe. But this reſtraint prov'd but like that which was us'd by the Parents of that loving <hi>Thisbe</hi> ſo celebrated by the Poets, and but added Flames to Flames, and Impatience to Deſires. As our Tongues were now debarr'd their former Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege, we had recourſe to our Pens, which aſſum'd the greater Freedom to diſcloſe the moſt hidden Secrets of our Hearts; for the preſence of the belov'd Object often heightens a certain awe and baſhfulneſs that diſorders, confounds, and ſtrikes dumb even the moſt paſſionate Lover. How many Letters have I writ to that lovely Charmer! How many ſoft moving Verſes have I not addreſs'd to her! What kind yet honourable Returns have I not receiv'd from her! the mutual Pledges of our ſecret Love, and the innocent Conſolations of a violent Paſſion! At length languiſhing and waſting with Deſire, depriv'd of that reviving Comfort of my Soul, I reſolv'd to remove thoſe
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:54446:149"/>
Bars with which her Father's Care and decent Caution obſtructed my only happineſs, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding her of him in Marriage. He very civilly told me, that he thank'd me for the Honor I did him, but that I had a Father alive, whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent was to be obtain'd as well as his, and who was the moſt proper Perſon to make ſuch a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal. Thereupon going to my Father with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to beg his Approbation and Aſſiſtance, I found him in his Chamber with a Letter open'd in his hand, which, as ſoon as he ſaw me, he put into my hand, before I cou'd have time to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with my Buſineſs. <hi>Cardenio,</hi> ſaid he, you'll ſee by this Letter the extraordinary kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that Duke <hi>Ricardo</hi> has for you. I ſuppoſe I need not tell you, Gentlemen, that this Duke <hi>Ricardo</hi> is a Grandee of <hi>Spain,</hi> moſt of whoſe Eſtate lies in the beſt part of <hi>Andaluzia.</hi> I read the Letter, and found it contain'd ſo kind and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous an Offer, that my Father cou'd not but accept of it with thankfulneſs: For the Duke en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to ſend me to him with all ſpeed, that I might be the Companion of his eldeſt Son, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing withal to advance me to a Poſt anſwerable to the good Opinion he had of me. This unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected News ſtruck me dumb; but my Surprize and Diſappointment were much greater, when I heard my Father ſay to me, <hi>Cardenio,</hi> you muſt get ready to be gone in two days; in the mean time give Heaven thanks for opening you a way to that Preferment, which I am ſenſible you deſerve. After this he gave me ſeveral wiſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions both as a Father and a Man of buſineſs, and then he left me. The Day fix'd for my Journy quickly came; however the night that preceded it, I ſpoke to <hi>Lucinda</hi> at her Window, and told
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:54446:150"/>
her what had happen'd. I alſo gave her Father a viſit, and inform'd him of it too; beſeeching him to preſerve his good Opinion of me, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the beſtowing of his Daughter till I had been with Duke <hi>Ricardo,</hi> which he kindly promis'd me: and then <hi>Lucinda</hi> and I after an exchange of Vows and Proteſtations of eternal Fidelity, took our leaves of one another, with all the Grief which two tender and paſſionate Lovers can feel at a ſeparation.</p>
                           <p>I left the Town, and went to wait upon the Duke, who receiv'd and entertain'd me with that extraordinary Kindneſs and Civility that ſoon rais'd the envy of his greateſt Favorites. But he that moſt endearingly careſs'd me, was <hi>Don Ferdinand,</hi> the Duke's ſecond Son, a young, airy, handſom, generous Gentleman, and of a very amorous Diſpoſition; he ſeem'd to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd at my coming, and in a moſt obliging manner told me he wou'd have me be one of his moſt intimate Friends. In ſhort, he ſo really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd me of his Affection, that tho his elder Brother gave me many Teſtimonies of Love and Eſteem, yet cou'd I eaſily diſtinguiſh between their Favors. Now, as 'tis common for Boſom-Friends to keep nothing ſecret from each other, <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> relying as much on my Fidelity, as I had reaſon to depend on his, reveal'd to me his moſt private thoughts, and among the reſt his being in love with the Daughter of a very rich Farmer who was his Father's Vaſſal. The Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that lovely Country Maid, her Virtue, her Diſcretion, and the other Graces of her Mind, gain'd her the admiration of all thoſe who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd her; and thoſe uncommon Endowments had ſo charm'd the Soul of <hi>Don Ferdinand,</hi> that
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:54446:150"/>
finding it abſolutely impoſſible to corrupt her Chaſtity, ſince ſhe wou'd not yield to his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces as a Miſtriſs, he reſolv'd to marry her. I thought my ſelf oblig'd by all the Ties of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and Friendſhip, to diſſuade him from ſo unſutable a Match; and therefore I made uſe of ſuch Arguments as might have diverted any one but ſo confirm'd a Lover from ſuch an unequal Choice. At laſt finding 'em all ineffectual, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to inform the Duke his Father with his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions: But <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> was too clear-ſighted not to read my Deſign in my great Diſlike of his Reſolutions, and dreading ſuch a Diſcovery, which he knew my Duty to his Father might well war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, in ſpight of our Intimacy, ſince I look'd upon ſuch a Marriage as highly prejudicial to 'em both, he made it his Buſineſs to hinder me from betraying his Paſſion to his Father's Knowledg, aſſuring me there wou'd be no need to reveal it to him. To blind me effectually, he told me he was willing to try the power of Abſence, that common Cure of Love, thus to wear out and loſe his unhappy Paſſion; and that in order to this, he wou'd take a Journey with me to my Father's houſe, pretending to buy Horſes in our Town, where the beſt in the world are bred. No ſooner had I heard this plauſible Propoſal, but I approv'd it, ſway'd by the Intereſt of my own Love, that made me fond of an opportunity to ſee my abſent <hi>Lucinda.</hi> I have heard ſince that <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> had then already been bleſt by his Miſtriſs with all that boundleſs Love allows, in the quality of a Husband, and that he only waited an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to diſcover it with ſafety, being afraid of incurring his Father's Indignation. But as that which we call Love in young People is too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:54446:151"/>
only an irregular Paſſion and boiling Deſire, that has no other Object than ſenſual Pleaſure, and vaniſhes with Enjoyment, while real Love fixing it ſelf on the Perfections of the Mind is ſtill improving and permanent; as ſoon as <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> had reap'd the Fruits of his Deſires, his ſtrong Affection ſlacken'd, and his hot Love grew cold: So that if at firſt his propoſing to try the power of Abſence, was only a Pretence that he might poſſeſs his wiſhes, there was nothing now which he more heartily coveted, that he might avoid their former Object. And therefore having obtain'd the Duke's leave, away we poſted to my Father's Houſe, where <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd according to his Quality; and I went to viſit my <hi>Lucinda,</hi> who by a thouſand innocent Endearments, made me ſenſible that her Love, like mine, was rather heighten'd than weaken'd by abſence, if any thing cou'd heighten a Love ſo great and ſo perfect. I then thought my ſelf oblig'd by the Laws of Friendſhip not to conceal the Secrets of my heart from ſo kind and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate a Friend, who had ſo generouſly intruſted me with his; and therefore, to my eternal Ruin, I unhappily diſcover'd to him my Paſſion. I prais'd <hi>Lucinda</hi>'s Beauty, her Wit, her Virtue, and prais'd 'em ſo like a Lover, ſo often and ſo highly, that I rais'd in him a great Deſire to ſee ſo accompliſh'd a Lady; and to gratify his Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I ſhow'd her to him by the help of a Light, one Evening at a low Window, where we us'd to hold our amorous Interviews. She prov'd but too charming, and too ſtrong a Temptation to <hi>Don Ferdinand;</hi> and her prevailing Image made ſo deep an Impreſſion on his Soul, that 'twas ſufficient to blot out of his mind all thoſe daily Beauties
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:54446:151"/>
that had till then imploy'd his wanton Thoughts, he was ſtruck dumb with Wonder and Delight at the ſight of the raviſhing Apparition; and in ſhort, to ſee her and to love her prov'd with him the ſame thing: and when I ſay to love her, I need not add to deſperation, for there's no loving her but to an Extreme. If her Face made him ſo ſoon take fire, her Wit quickly ſet him all in a Flame. He often importun'd me to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to him ſome of her Letters, which I indeed wou'd ne'er expoſe to any eyes but my own; but unhappily one day he found one, wherein ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd me to demand her of her Father, and to haſten the Marriage. It was pen'd with that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and diſcretion, that when he had red it, he preſently cry'd out, that the amorous Charms that were ſcatter'd and divided among other Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, were all divinely center'd in <hi>Lucinda,</hi> and in <hi>Lucinda</hi> alone. Shall I confeſs a ſhameful Truth? <hi>Lucinda</hi>'s Praiſes, tho never ſo deſerv'd, did not ſound pleaſantly to my Ears out of <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi>'s Mouth.

Errantry, deſir'd me to lend her the Romance of <hi>Amadis de Gaule</hi>—</p>
                           <p>Scarce had <hi>Cardenio</hi> mention'd Knight-Erran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, when <hi>Don Quixote</hi> interrupted him; Sir, ſaid he, had you but told me when you firſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd the Lady <hi>Lucinda,</hi> that ſhe was an Admirer of Books of Knight-Errantry, there had been no need of uſing any Amplification to convince me of her being a Perſon of uncommon Senſe: yet, Sir, had ſhe not us'd thoſe mighty Helps, thoſe infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Guides to Senſe, tho indulgent Nature had ſtrove to bleſs her with the richeſt Gifts ſhe can beſtow, I might juſtly enough have doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her Perfections could have gain'd her the Love of a Perſon of your Merit. But now you need not imploy your Eloquence to ſet forth the greatneſs of her Beauty, the excellence of her Worth, or the depth of her Senſe; for, from this account which I have of her taking great Delight in reading Books of Chivalry, I dare pronounce her to be the moſt beautiful, nay the moſt accompliſh'd Lady in the Univerſe: and I heartily cou'd have wiſh'd that with <hi>Amadis de Gaule</hi> you had ſent her the worthy <hi>Don Rugel</hi> of <hi>Greece;</hi> for I am certain the Lady <hi>Lucinda</hi> wou'd have been extremely delighted with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayda</hi> and <hi>Garaya,</hi> as alſo with the diſcreet Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd <hi>Darinel,</hi> and thoſe admirable Verſes of his <hi>Bucolics,</hi> which he ſung and repeated with ſo good a Grace. But a time may yet be found to give her the ſatisfaction of reading thoſe Maſter-pieces if you will do me the Honour to come to my Houſe; for there I may ſupply you with above three hundred Volumes, whch are my Soul's greateſt Delight, and the darling Comfort of my Life; tho now I remember my ſelf, I have
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:54446:152"/>
juſt reaſon to fear there's not one of 'em left in my Study, thanks to the malicious Envy of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Enchanters. I beg your pardon for giving you this interruption, contrary to my promiſe; but when I hear the leaſt mention made of Knight-Errantry, it is no more in my power to forbear ſpeaking, than 'tis in the Sun Beams not to warm, or in thoſe of the Moon not to impart her natural humidity; and therefore, Sir, I beſeech you to go on.</p>
                           <p>While <hi>Don Quixote</hi> was running on with this impertinent Digreſſion, <hi>Cardenio</hi> hung down his Head on his Breaſt with all the Signs of a Man loſt in ſorrow: Nor cou'd <hi>Don Quixote</hi> with repeated intreaties perſwade him to look up, or anſwer a Word. At laſt, after he had ſtood thus a conſiderable while, he rais'd his head, and ſuddenly breaking ſilence, I am poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively convinc'd, cry'd he, nor ſhall any Man in the world ever perſwade me to the contrary; and he's a Blockhead who ſays, that great Villain, Mr. <hi>Elizabat</hi> the Barber, never lay with Queen <hi>Madaſima.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>'Tis falſe, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> in a mighty heat, By all the Devils, (and with that he rap'd out three or four round Oaths, as he wou'd often do) 'tis all ſcandal and baſe Detraction to ſay this of Queen <hi>Madaſima.</hi> She was a moſt noble and virtuous Lady; nor is it to be preſum'd that ſo great a Princeſs would ever debaſe her If ſo far as to fall in love with a Quack. Whoever dares ſay ſhe did, lies like an errant Villain, and I'll make him acknowledg it, either a foot or a Horſeback, arm'd or unarm d, by Night or by Day, or how he pleaſes. <hi>Carde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio</hi> very earneſtly fix'd his Eyes on <hi>Don Quixote</hi>
                              <pb n="268" facs="tcp:54446:153"/>
while he was thus defying him, and taking Queen <hi>Madaſima</hi>'s part as if ſhe had been his true and lawful Princeſs; and being provok'd by theſe Abuſes into one of his mad Fits, he took up a great Stone that lay by him, and hit <hi>Don Quixote</hi> ſuch a blow with it that it beat him on his back. <hi>Sancho</hi> ſeeing his Lord and Maſter ſo roughly handled, fell upon, the mad Knight of the Rock with his clench'd Fiſts; but he beat him back at the firſt Onſet, and laid him at his Feet with a ſingle blow; and then he fell a trampling his Guts, like a Baker in a Dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trough. Nay the Goatherd, who was offering to take <hi>Sancho</hi>'s part, had like to have been ſerv'd in the ſame manner. So the ragged Knight having tumbled 'em one over another, and beaten 'em handſomly, he left 'em, and ran into the Woods without the leaſt oppoſition.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Sancho</hi> got up when he ſaw him gone, and being very much out of humour to find himſelf ſo roughly handled without any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of reaſon, he began to pick a quarrel with the Goatherd, railing at him for not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warning 'em of the ragged Knight's mad Fits, that they might have ſtood upon their Guard. The Goatherd anſwer'd, he had given 'em warning at firſt, and if he cou'd not hear, 'twas no fault of his. To this <hi>Sancho</hi> reply'd, and the Goatherd made a Rejoinder, till from Pro's and Con's they fell to a warmer way of diſputing, and went to Fiſticuffs together, catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another by the Beards, and tugging, halling, and belabouring one another ſo unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully, that had not <hi>Don Quixote</hi> parted 'em, they would have pulled one anothers Chins off. <hi>Sancho</hi> in great wrath ſtill keeping his hold,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:54446:153"/>
cry'd to his Maſter, Let me alone, Sir Knight of the Woful Countenance. This is no dubb'd Knight, but an ordinary Fellow like my ſelf; I may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd on him for the wrong he has done me; let me box it out, and fight him fairly hand to fiſt like a Man. Thou mayſt fight him as he's thy Equal, anſwer'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> but thou ought'ſt not to do it ſince he has done us no wrong. After this he pacify'd 'em, and then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing himſelf to the Goatherd, he ask'd him whether it were not poſſible to find out <hi>Cardenio</hi> again, that he might hear the end of his Story. The Goatherd anſwer'd, that, as he had already told him, he knew of no ſettled place that he us'd, but that if they made any ſtay thereabouts he might be ſure to meet with him, mad or ſober, ſome time or other.</p>

                           <p>
                              <hi>DON Quixote</hi> took leave of the Goatherd, and having mounted <hi>Rozinante,</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Sancho</hi> to follow him, which he did, but with no very good will, his Maſter leading him into the rougheſt and moſt craggy part of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Thus they travell'd for a while without ſpeaking a word to each other; <hi>Sancho</hi> almoſt dead and ready to burſt for want of a little Chat, waited with great Impatience till his Maſter ſhould begin, not daring to ſpeak firſt ſince his ſtrict in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of Silence. But at laſt not being able to keep his words any longer, Good your Worſhip, quoth he, give me your Bleſſing and Leave to be gone, I beſeech you, that I may go home to my Wife and Children, where I may talk till I'm weary, and no body can hinder me; for I muſt needs tell you, that for you to think to lead me a jaunt like a Jack-a-Lanthorn, over Hedg and Ditch, thro Hills and Dales, by Night and by Day, without daring to open my Lips, is but to bury me alive. Could Beaſts ſpeak, as they did in <hi>Giaſopet</hi>'s Time, it had not been half ſo bad with me, for then I had had one here to have
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:54446:154"/>
talk'd with: but to trot on this faſhion all the days of my Life after Adventures, and to light on nothing but Thumps, Kicks, and Cuffs, to be one time at Leapfrog in a Blanket, and to have the Cawl of my Belly e'en almoſt burſt, as juſt now, and after all forſooth to have a man's Mouth ſow'd up, without daring to ſpeak one's Mind, I ſay't again, no living Soul can endure it. I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thee, <hi>Sancho,</hi> anſwer'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> thou linger'ſt with Impatience to exerciſe thy talking Faculty. Well, I am willing to free thy Tongue from this Reſtraint that ſo cruelly pains thee, upon condition, that the time of this Licenſe ſhall not extend beyond that of our continuance in theſe Mountains. A match, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> let's make Hay while the Sun ſhines. I'll talk while I may; what I may do hereafter Heaven knows beſt. And ſo beginning to take the Benefit of his Privilege, pray Sir, quoth he, what Occaſion had you to take ſo hotly the part of Queen <hi>Magimaſa,</hi> or what d' ye call her? What a Devil was it to you, whether that ſame <hi>Maſter Abbot</hi> were her Friend in a Corner, or no? Had you taken no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of what was ſaid, as you might well have done, ſeeing 'twas no buſineſs of yours, the Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man would have gone on with his Story; you had miſs'd a good Thump on the Breaſt, and I had ſcap'd ſome five or ſix good dowſes on the Chaps, beſides the trampling of my Puddings. Upon my honour, friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> reply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> did'ſt thou but know, as well as I do, what a virtuous and eminent Lady Queen <hi>Madaſima</hi> was, thou would'ſt ſay I had a great deal of Patience, ſeeing I did not ſtrike that profane Wretch on the Mouth out of which ſuch Blaſphemies proceeded: For in ſhort, 'twas the higheſt piece of Detraction to ſay,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:54446:155"/>
That a Queen was ſcandalouſly familiar with a Barber-Surgeon: For the truth of the ſtory is, that this Maſter <hi>Elizabat,</hi> of whom the Madman ſpoke, was a Perſon of extraordinary Prudence, and Sagacity, and was Phyſician to that Queen, who alſo made uſe of his Advice in matters of Importance; but to ſay ſhe gave him up her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and proſtituted her ſelf to the Embraces of a man of an inferior Order, was an impudent, groundleſs, and ſlanderous Accuſation, worthy the ſevereſt Puniſhment: neither can I believe that <hi>Cardenio</hi> knew what he ſaid, when he charg'd the Queen with that debaſing Guilt; for 'tis plain that his raving Fit had diſorder'd the ſeat of his Underſtanding. Why, there it is, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> who but a Madman would have minded what a Madman ſaid? What if the Flint that had hit you in the Breaſt had paſh'd your Brains? We had been in a dainty pickle for taking the part of that ſame Lady, with a peaſcod on her. Nay and <hi>Cardenio</hi> would have come off too had he knock'd you on the Head, for the Law has nothing to do with Madmen. <hi>Sancho,</hi> reply'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> we Knights-Errant are oblig'd to vindicate the honour of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of all Quality ſoever, as well againſt Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as againſt men in their Senſes; much more of Queens of that Magnitude and extraordinary Worth as was Queen <hi>Madaſima,</hi> for whoſe rare Endowments I have a peculiar Veneration; for ſhe was a moſt beautiful Lady, Diſcreet and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to admiration, and behav'd her ſelf with an exemplary Patience in all her Misfortunes: 'Twas then that the Company and wholeſome Counſels of Maſter <hi>Elizabat</hi> prov'd very uſeful to alleviate the burden of her Afflictions; from which the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and ill meaning Vulgar took occaſion to
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:54446:155"/>
ſuſpect and rumour, that ſhe was guilty of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Commerce with him. But I ſay once more, they lie and lie a thouſand times, whoever they be, that ſhall preſumptuouſly report, or hint, or ſo much as think or ſurmiſe ſo baſe a Calumny.</p>
                           <p>Why, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I neither ſay nor think one way nor t'other not I: Let them that ſay it eat the Lie, and ſwallow it with their Bread. If they lay together, they have anſwer'd for it before now. I never thruſt my Noſe into other men's Porrige. I don't love to tell a Lie, and find the Truth; that were as bad as to buy and ſell, and live by the Loſs. Let him that owns the Cow take her by the Tail. Naked I came into the World, and naked muſt I go out. Many go out for Wool, that come home ſhorn themſelves. Little ſaid is ſoon amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It's a Sin to belie the Devil. But miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding brings lies to Town, and there's no pad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locking of People's Mouths; for a cloſe Mouth catches no flies.</p>
                           <p>Good Heaven, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> what a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of muſty Proverbs haſt thou run thro! What a heap of frippery Ware haſt thou thread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, and how wide from the purpoſe! Prethee have done, and for the Future let thy whole Study be to ſerve thy Maſter; nor do thou concern thy ſelf with things that are out of thy Sphere: And remember this, That whatſoever I do, have done, and ſhall do, is no more than what is the reſult of mature Conſideration, and ſtrictly conformable to the Laws of Chivalry, which I underſtand better than all the Knights that ever profeſs'd Knight-Errantry. Ay, ay Sir, quoth <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho;</hi> but pray, is't a good Law of Chivalry that ſays we ſhould wander up and down, over Buſhes and Bryars, in this rocky Wilderneſs, where there's
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:54446:156"/>
neither Foot-path nor Way, running a Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gooſe Chaſe after a Madman, who, if we light on him again, may chance to make an end of what he has begun; not of his Tale of a roaſted Horſe I mean, but of be labouring you and me thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſqueezing out my Guts at both ends. Once more I prethee have done, ſaid <hi>Don Quixote:</hi> I have Buſineſs of greater Moment than the finding this frantic man; it is not ſo much that Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that detains me in this barren and deſolate Wild, as a deſire I have to perform a certain he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roic Deed that ſhall immortalize my Fame; and make it fly to the remoteſt Regions of the habit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Globe; nay it ſhall ſeal and confirm me the moſt compleat and abſolute Knight-Errant in the World. But is not this ſame Adventure very dangerous, ask'd <hi>Sancho?</hi> Not at all, replied <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> tho as Fortune may order it, our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations may be baffled by diſappointing Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents: but the main thing conſiſts in thy Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. The Devil it does, quoth <hi>Sancho!</hi> I mean, ſaid <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> that if thou return'ſt with all the ſpeed imaginable from the place whither I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to ſend thee, my Pain will ſoon be at an end, and my Glory will begin. And becauſe I do not doubt thy Zeal for advancing thy Maſter's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, I will no longer conceal my Deſigns from thee. Know then, my moſt faithful Squire, that <hi>Amadis de Gaule</hi> was one of the moſt accompliſh'd Knights-Errant; nay I ſhould not have ſaid he was one of 'em, but the moſt Perfect, the Chief, and Prince of 'em all. And let not the <hi>Belianiſes</hi> nor any others pretend to ſtand in competition with him for the honour of Priority; for, to my knowledg, ſhould they attempt it, they would be egregiouſly in the Wrong. I muſt alſo inform
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:54446:156"/>
thee, that when a Painter ſtudies to excel and grow famous in his Art, he takes Care to imitate the beſt Originals; which Rule ought likewiſe to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in all other Arts and Sciences that ſerve for the Ornament of well regulated Commonwealths. Thus he that is ambitious of gaining the Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Prudent and Patient Man, ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to himſelf to imitate <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> in whoſe Perſon <hi>Homer</hi> has admirably delineated a perfect pattern and prototype of Wiſdom and heroic Patience. So <hi>Virgil</hi> in his <hi>Aeneas</hi> has given the World a rare Example of filial Piety, and of the Sagacity of a valiant and experienc'd General; both the Greek and the Roman Poets repreſenting their Heroes not ſuch as they really were, but ſuch as they ſhould be, to remain examples of Virtue to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Ages. In the ſame manner, <hi>Amadis</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been the Polar Star and Sun of valiant and amorous Knights, 'tis him we ought to ſet before our Eye as our great Exemplar, all of us that fight under the Banner of Love and Chivalry; for 'tis certain that the Adventurer who ſhall emulate him beſt, ſhall conſequently arrive neareſt to the Perfection of Knight-Errantry. Now <hi>Sancho,</hi> I find that among other Things which moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play'd that Champion's Prudence, and Fortitude, his Conſtancy and Love, and his other heroic Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, none was more remarkable than his retiring from his diſdainful <hi>Oriana,</hi> to do Penance on the poor Rock, changing his Name into that of <hi>The Lovely Obſcure,</hi> a Title certainly moſt ſignificant, and adapted to the Life which he then intended to lead. So I am reſolv'd to imitate him in this, the rather becauſe I think it a more eaſy Task than it would be to copy his other Atchievements, ſuch as cleaving the Bodies of Giants, cutting off the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:54446:157"/>
heads of Dragons, killing dreadful Monſters, rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whole Armies, diſperſing Navies, and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Force of Magic Spells. And ſince theſe mountainous Wilds offer me ſo fair an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, I ſee no reaſon why I ſhould neglect it, and therefore I'll lay hold on it now. Very well, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> but pray, Sir, what is it you mean to do in this Fag-end of the World? Have I not already told thee, anſwer'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> that I intend to copy <hi>Amadis</hi> in his Madneſs, Deſpair, and Fury? At the ſame Time I will imitate the valiant <hi>Orlando Furioſo</hi>'s Extravagance, when he ran Mad, after he had found the unhappy Tokens of the Fair <hi>Angelica</hi>'s diſhonorable Commerce with <hi>Medor</hi> at the Fountain; at which Time in his frantic Deſpair, he tore up Trees by the Roots, troubled the Waters of the clear Fountains, ſlew the Shepherds, deſtroy'd their Flocks, fir'd their Huts, demoliſh'd Houſes, drove their Horſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and committed a hundred thouſand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Extravagancies worthy to be recorded in the eternal Regiſter of Fame. Not that I intend how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in all things to imitate <hi>Roldan,</hi> or <hi>Orlando,</hi> or <hi>Rotoland,</hi> (for he had all thoſe names) but only to make choice of ſuch frantic Effects of his amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Deſpair as I ſhall think moſt eſſential, and worthy Imitation. Nay perhaps I ſhall wholly follow <hi>Amadis,</hi> who without launching out into ſuch deſtructive and fatal Ravings, and only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing his Anguiſh in Complaints and Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, gain'd nevertheleſs a Renown equal, if not ſuperior to that of the greateſt Heroes. Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I dare ſay, the Knights who did theſe Penances had ſome reaſon to be mad; but what need have you to be mad too? What Lady has ſent you a packing, or ſo much as toſs'd up her
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:54446:157"/>
Snout at you? When did you ever find that my Lady <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo,</hi> did otherwiſe than ſhe ſhould do with either Turk or Chriſtian? Why, there's the point cry'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts the ſingular perfection of my Undertaking; for mark me <hi>Sancho,</hi> for a Knight Errant to run mad upon any juſt Occaſion, is neither ſtrange nor meritorious; no, the rarity is to run mad without a Cauſe, without the leaſt Conſtraint or Neceſſity, <hi>Sancho;</hi> there's a refin'd and exquiſite Paſſion for you: for thus my Miſtreſs muſt needs have a vaſt Idea of my Love, ſince if it drove me to ſuch a ſtate without any provocation, it muſt undoubtedly have carried me to the ſtrangeſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, had I labour'd under any amorous Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune. But beſides, I have but too juſt a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to give a looſe to my raving Grief, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the long date of my Abſence from my ever ſupreme Lady <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo;</hi> for as the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd in <hi>Mathias Ambroſio</hi> has it,
<q>
                                 <l>Poor Lovers abſent from the Darling Fair,</l>
                                 <l>All Ills not only dread, but bear.</l>
                              </q>
Then do not laviſh any more Time in ſtriving to divert me from ſo rare, ſo happy, and ſo ſingular an Imitation. I am mad, and will be mad, till thy return with an anſwer to the Letter which thou muſt carry from me to the Lady <hi>Dulcinea;</hi> and if it be as favorable as my unſhaken Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy deſerves, then my Madneſs and my Penance ſhall end; but if I find ſhe repays my Vows and Services with ungrateful Diſdain, then will I be emphatically Mad, and ſcrue up my Thoughts to ſuch an exceſs of Diſtraction that I ſhall be inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the rigour of my relentleſs Fair. Thus,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:54446:158"/>
what return ſoever ſhe makes to my Paſſion, I ſhall be eas'd one way or other of the anxious Thoughts that now divide my Soul; either enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the welcom News of her reviving Pity with demonſtrations of Senſe, or elſe ſhowing my inſenſibility of her Cruelty by the heigth of my Diſtraction. But in the mean time, <hi>Sancho,</hi> tell me, haſt thou carefully preſerv'd <hi>Mambrino</hi>'s Helmet? I ſaw thee take it up t'other Day, after that Monſter of Ingratitude had ſpent his Rage in vain endeavours to break it, which by the way, argues the moſt excellent Temper of the Metal. Body of me, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> Sir Knight of the woful Countenance, I can no longer bear to hear you run on at this rate: Why, this were enough to make any man believe that all your bragging and bouncing of your Knight-Errantry, your win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Kingdoms with a wet Finger, and your beſtowing of Iſlands, and Heaven knows what up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Squire, are meer flim flam Stories, and nothing but ſhams and lies: For who the Devil can hear a man call a Barber's Baſon a Helmet, nay and ſtand to't, and vouch it for four days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and not think him that ſays it to be ſtark Mad, or without Guts in his Brains? I have the Baſon ſafe enough here in my Pouch, and I'll get it mended for my own Uſe, if ever I've the luck to get home to my Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Now as I love bright Arms, cry'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> I ſwear thou art the ſhalloweſt, ſillieſt, and moſt ſtupid Fellow of a Squire that ever I heard or read of in my Life. How is it poſſible for thee to be ſo dull of Apprehenſion, as not to have learnt in all this Time that thou haſt been in my Service, that all the Actions and Adventures of us Knights-errant ſeem to be mere Chimeras,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:54446:158"/>
Follies, and Impertinences? Not that they are ſo indeed, but either thro the officious Care, or elſe thro the Malice and Envy of thoſe Enchanters that always aſſiſt or perſecute us unſeen, and by their faſcinations change the appearances of our Actions into what they pleaſe, according to their love or hate. This is the very reaſon why that which I plainly perceive to be <hi>Mambrino</hi>'s Helmet ſeems to thee to be only a Barber's Baſon, and perhaps another Man may take it to be ſomething elſe. And in this I can never too much admire the Prudence of the Sage who eſpouſes my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, in making that ineſtimable Helmet ſeem a Baſon; for did it appear in its proper Shape, its tempting Value would raiſe me as many Enemies as there are Men in the Univerſe, all eager to ſnatch from me ſo deſirable a Prize. Keep it ſafe then, <hi>Sancho,</hi> for I have no need of it at preſent; far from it, I think to put off my Armour, and ſtrip my ſelf as naked as I came out of my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Womb, in caſe I determine to imitate <hi>Orlando</hi>'s Fury rather than the Penance of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This Diſcourſe brought 'em to the foot of a high Rock that ſtood by it ſelf, as if it had been hewn out and divided from the reſt; by the skirt of it glided a purling Stream that ſoftly took its winding Courſe thro an adjacent Meadow. The verdant freſhneſs of the Graſs, the number of wild Trees, Plants, and Flowers that feaſted the Eye in that pleaſant Solitude, invited the Knight of the woful Countenance to make choice of it to perform his amorous Penance; and therefore as ſoon as he had let his raviſh'd Sight rove a while o're the ſcatter'd beauties of the Place, he took poſſeſſion of it with the following Speech, as if
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:54446:159"/>
he had utterly loſt the ſmall ſhare of Reaſon he had left. Behold, O Heavens, cry'd he, the place which an unhappy Lover has choſen to bemoan the deplorable State to which you have reduc'd him; here ſhall my flowing Tears ſwell the liquid Veins of this Chriſtal Rill, and my deep Sighs perpetually move the Leaves of theſe ſhady Trees, the ever-renew'd Inſtances of the Torments which my throbbing Heart endures. Ye Rural Deities, whoever ye be, that make theſe unfrequented De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts your Abode, hear the Complaints of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Lover, whom a tedious Abſence, and ſome ſlight impreſſions of jealous Miſtruſt have driven to theſe regions of Deſpair, to bewail his rigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Deſtiny, and deplore the diſtracting Cruelty of that ungrateful Fair who is the perfection of all humane Beauty. Ye pitying <hi>Napaean</hi> Nymphs and <hi>Dryades,</hi> ſilent Inhabitants of the Woods and Groves, aſſiſt me to lament my Fate, or at leaſt attend the mournful Story of my Woes; ſo may no deſigning beaſtly Satyrs, thoſe juſt Objects of your hate, ever have power to interrupt your Reſt.— Oh <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo!</hi> Thou Sun that turn'ſt my gloomy Nights to Day! Glory of my Pain! North-Star of my Travels, and reigning Planet that controul'ſt my Heart! Pity I conjure thee the unparallel'd Diſtreſs to which thy Abſence has reduc'd the faithfulleſt of Lovers, and grant to my Fidelity that kind Return which it ſo juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly claims! So may indulgent Fate ſhower on thee all the Bleſſings thou ever can'ſt deſire, or Heavens grant! — Ye loneſome Trees, under whoſe ſpreading Branches I come to linger out the gloomy ſhadow of a tedious Being; let the ſoft Language of your ruſtling Leaves, and the kind nodding of your ſpringing Boughs ſatisfy me that I
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:54446:159"/>
am welcom to your ſhady Harbours. O thou my truſty Squire, the inſeparable Companion of my Adventures, diligently obſerve what thou ſhalt ſee me do in this lonely Retreat, that thou may'ſt inform the dear Cauſe of my Ruin with every particular. As he ſaid this, he alighted, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently taking of his Horſe's Bridle and Saddle, go, <hi>Rozinante,</hi> ſaid he, giving the Horſe a clap on the Poſteriors; he that has loſt his Freedom gives thee thine, thou Steed as renown'd for thy extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Actions as for thy Misfortunes: go rear thy awful Front where e're thou pleaſeſt, ſecure that neither the <hi>Hippogriphon</hi> of <hi>Aſtolpho,</hi> nor the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown'd <hi>Frontino</hi> which <hi>Bradamante</hi> purchaſed at ſo high a Price, could ever be thought thy Equals.</p>
                           <p>Now cry'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> a ſliding knot choak him that ſav'd me the trouble of ſending my Aſs to Graſs too; poor thing, had I him here he ſhould not want two or three claps o're the Buttocks, nor a fine Speech in his praiſe neither, while I took off his Pannel. But ſtay, were he here, what need would there be to ſtrip him of his Harneſs? Alas, poor Creature, he never had any thing to do with theſe mad pranks of Love no more than my ſelf, who was his Maſter, when Fortune pleas'd. But d'ye hear me, now I think on't, Sir Knight of the woful Countenance, if your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is reſolv'd to be Mad and ſend me away in good earneſt, we muſt e'en clap the Saddle again on <hi>Rozinante</hi>'s Back; for to tell you the Truth I'm but a ſorry Footman, and if I don't ride home I don't know when I ſhall be able to come to you again. Do as thou think'ſt fit for that, <hi>Sancho,</hi> anſwer'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> for I deſign thou ſhalt ſet forward about three Days hence. In the mean
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:54446:160"/>
while thou ſhalt be a witneſs of what I will do for my Lady's ſake, that thou may'ſt give her an account of it. Bleſs my Eyeſight, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> what can I ſee more than I've ſeen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready? Thou haſt ſeen nothing yet, anſwer'd <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> thou muſt ſee me throw away my Armour, tear my Cloths, knock my Head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Rocks, and do a thouſand other Things of that kind that will fill thee with Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. For goodneſs ſake, Sir, quoth <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> take heed how you quarrel with theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious Rocks, you may chance to get ſuch a crack o' the Crown at the very firſt Rap as may ſpoil a rare Madman, and a ſpecial Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to boot, all at one daſh. No, I don't like that way by no means; if you muſt needs be knocking your Noddle, to go thro' ſtitch with this ugly Job, ſeeing 'tis all but a mock, or as it were between Jeſt and Earneſt, why can't you as well play your Tricks on ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that's ſofter than theſe unconſcionable Stones? you may run your Head againſt the Water, or rather againſt Cotton, or the ſtuffing of <hi>Rozi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nante</hi>'s Saddle, and then let me alone with the reſt: I'll be ſure to tell my Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi> that you bebump'd your Poll againſt the point of a Rock that's harder than a Diamond.</p>
                           <p>I thank thee for thy good Will, dear <hi>Sancho,</hi> replyed <hi>Don Quixote.</hi> But I aſſure thee that all theſe ſeeming Extravagancies which I muſt run thro are no Jeſts. Far from it, they muſt be all perform'd ſeriouſly and ſolemnly; for otherwiſe we ſhou'd tranſgreſs the Laws of Chivalry, that forbid us to tell Lies upon pain of Degradation: now to pretend to do one thing, and effect ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is an Evaſion which I eſteem to be as bad as
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:54446:160"/>
Lying. Therefore the Blows which I muſt give my ſelf on the Head ought to be real, ſubſtantial, ſound ones, without any Trick or mental Reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for which reaſon I wou'd have thee leave me ſome Lint and Salve, ſince Fortune has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd us of the ſoveraign Balſam which we loſt. 'Twas a worſe Loſs to loſe the Aſs, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> for with him we've loſt Bag and Baggage, Lint and all. But no more of your damn'd Drench, if you love me; the very thoughts on 't are enough not only to turn my Stomach, but my Soul, ſuch a rumbling I feel in my Wemb at the name on't. Then as for the three Days you'd have me loyter here to mind your mad Tricks, you had as good make account they're already over; for I hold 'em for done, unſight unſeen, and will tell Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to my Lady: wherefore write you your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſend me going with all haſte; for let me be hang'd if I don't long already to be back to take you out of this Purgatory wherein I leave you.</p>
                           <p>Doſt thou only call it Purgatory, <hi>Sancho,</hi> cry'd <hi>Don Quixote?</hi> call it Hell rather, or ſomething worſe, if there be in Nature a term expreſſive of a more wretched ſtate. Nay, not ſo neither, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I wou'd not call it Hell; becauſe as I heard our Parſon ſay, <hi>There's no Retention out of Hell.</hi> Retention, cry'd <hi>Don Quixot!</hi> what do'ſt thou mean by that word? Why, quoth <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> Retention is Retention, it is, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is in Hell never comes, nor can come out of it. Which ſhan't be your Caſe this Bout, if I can ſtir my Heels, and have but Spurs to tickle <hi>Rozinante</hi>'s Flank, till I come to my Lady <hi>Dulci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea;</hi> for I will tell her ſuch ſtrange things of your Maggotty Tricks, your Folly and your
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:54446:161"/>
Madneſs, for indeed they are no better, that I'll lay my Head to a hazel Nut, I'll make her as ſupple as a Glove, tho I found her at firſt as tough hearted as Cork; and when I've wheedled an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer out of her all full of ſweet hony Words, away will I whisk it back to you cutting the Air, as ſwift as a Witch upon a Broomſtick, and free you out of your Purgatory; for a Purgatory I will have it to be, in ſpight of Hell; nor ſhall you gainſay me in that I fancy; for, as I've told you before, there's ſome hopes of your Retention out of this place.</p>
                           <p>Well, be it ſo, ſaid the Knight of the Woful Countenance; but how ſhall I do to write this Letter? And the Order for the three Aſſes, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Sancho?</hi> I'll not forget it, anſwer'd <hi>Don Quixote;</hi> But ſince we have here no Paper, I muſt be oblig'd to write on the Leaves or Bark of Trees, or on Wax, as they did in antient Times; yet now I conſider on't, vve are here as ill provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vvith Wax as vvith Paper. But ſtay, now I remember, I have <hi>Cardenio</hi>'s Pocket-Book, vvhich will ſupply that vvant in this Exigence, and then thou ſhalt get the Letter fairly tranſcrib'd at the firſt Village where thou canſt meet with a School-maſter; or for vvant of a Schoolmaſter, thou may'ſt get the Clark of the Pariſh to do it: but by no means give it to any Notary or Lawyer to be written out, for they commonly write ſuch confounded hands, that the Devil himſelf wou'd ſcarce be able to read it. Well, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but vvhat ſhall I do for vvant of your Name to it? Why, anſwer'd <hi>Don Quixote, Amadis</hi> never us'd to ſubſcribe his Letters. Ay, reply'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> but the Bill of Exchange for the three Aſſes muſt be ſign'd, and ſhou'd I get it copy'd out after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:54446:161"/>
they'd ſay 'tis not your hand, and ſo I ſhall go vvithout the Aſſes. I'll vvrite and ſign the Order for 'em in the Table-Book, anſwer'd <hi>Don Quixote;</hi> and as ſoon as my Niece ſhall ſee the hand, ſhe'll never ſcruple the delivery of the Aſſes: And as for the Love-Letter, when thou get'ſt it tranſcrib'd, thou muſt get it thus under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written; <hi>Your's till Death, The Knight of the Woful Countenance.</hi> 'Tis no matter whether the Letter and the Subſcription be vvritten by the ſame hand or no; for as I remember, <hi>Dulcinea</hi> can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther read nor write, nor did ſhe ever ſee any of my Letters, nay not ſo much as any of my Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in her life: For my Love and her's have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been purely Platonic, never extending be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the lawful Bounds of a modeſt Look; and that too ſo very ſeldom, that I dare ſafely ſwear, that tho for theſe twelve Years ſhe has been dearer to my Soul than Light to my Eyes, yet I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw her four times in my life, and perhaps of thoſe few times that I have ſeen her, ſhe has ſcarce perceiv'd once that I beheld her.

I ſaw her one day pearch'd up o' top of our Steeple to call to ſome Plough-jobbers that labour'd in a fallow Field; and tho they vvere half a League off, they heard her as plain as if they had been in the Church-yard under her. The beſt of her is, that ſhe's neither coy nor frumpiſh; ſhe's a tractable Laſs and fit for a Courtier, for ſhe'll play with you like a Kitten, and jibes and jokes at every body. And now in good truth, Sir Knight of the Woful Countenance, you may e'en play as many Gambols as you pleaſe; you may run mad, you may hang your ſelf for her ſake, there's no body but will ſay you e'en took the wiſeſt courſe, tho the Devil himſelf ſhould carry you away a pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apack. Now am I e'en wild to be gone, tho 'twere for nothing elſe but to ſee her, for I have not ſeen her this many a day; I fancy I ſhall hardly know her again, for a Woman's Face ſtrangely alters by being always in the Sun, and drudging and moiling in the open Fields. Well, I muſt needs own I've been mightily miſtaken all along: for I durſt have ſworn this Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi> had been ſome great Princeſs with whom you were in love, and ſuch a one as deſerv'd thoſe rare Gifts you beſtow'd on her, as the Biſcayan, the Gally-ſlaves, and many others that for ought I know you may have ſent her before I was your Squire.

                           <p>I have often told thee, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid <hi>Don Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote,</hi> and I tell thee again, that thou ought'ſt to bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle or immure thy ſawcy prating Tongue; for tho thou art but a dull-headed Dunce, yet now and then thy ill-manner'd Jeſts bite too ſharp. But that I may at once make thee ſenſible of thy Folly and my Diſcretion, I will tell thee a ſhort Story. A handſom, brisk, young rich Widow, happen'd to fall in Love with a well-ſet, luſty<note n="*" place="margin">
                                 <hi>Motillon,</hi> a Lay-Brother, or Servant in a Convent or College.</note> 
                              <hi>Lay-Brother.</hi> His <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior</hi> hearing of it, took occaſion to go to her, and ſaid to her, by way of charitable Admonition, I mightily wonder, <hi>Madam,</hi> how a Lady of your Merit, ſo admir'd for Beauty and for Senſe, and withal ſo Rich, cou'd make ſo ill a choice, and doat on a mean, ſilly, deſpicable Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, as I hear you do, while we have in our Houſe ſo many Maſters of Art, Batchelors and Doctors of Divinity, among whom your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip might pick and chuſe. But ſhe ſoon anſwer'd the officious grave Gentleman, Sir, ſaid ſhe with a ſmile, you are much miſtaken, and think alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether after the old out-of-faſhion-way, if you i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine I have made ſo ill a choice; for tho you fancy the Man's a Fool, yet as to what I take him for, he knows as much, or rather more Philoſophy than <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> So, <hi>Sancho,</hi> as to the uſe which I make of the Lady <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> ſhe is equal to the greateſt Princeſſes in the World. Prethee tell me,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:54446:163"/>
Doſt thou think the Poets, who every one of 'em celebrate the Praiſes of ſome Lady or other, had all real Miſtreſſes? Or that the <hi>Amarillis</hi>'s, the <hi>Phillis</hi>'s, the <hi>Sylvia</hi>'s, the <hi>Diana</hi>'s, the <hi>Galatea</hi>'s, and the like, which you ſhall find in ſo many Poems, Romances, Songs and Ballads, upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Stage, and even in every Barber's Shop, were Creatures of Fleſh and Blood? No, no, never think it, for I dare aſſure thee, the greateſt part of 'em were nothing but the meer Imaginations of the Poets, for a ground-work to exerciſe their Wits upon, and to give the World occaſion to look on the Authors as Men of an amorous and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Diſpoſition: and ſo 'tis ſufficient for me to imagine that <hi>Aldonza Lorenzo</hi> is beautiful and chaſt; as for her Birth and Parentage, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern me but little; for there's no need to make an enquiry about a Woman's Pedigree, as there is of us Men when ſome Badg of Honour is beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on us. And ſo ſhe's to me the greateſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in the World: For thou ought'ſt to know, <hi>Sancho,</hi> if thou know'ſt it not already, that there are but two things that chiefly excite us to love a Woman, an attractive Beauty, and an unſpotted Fame. Now thoſe two Endowments are happily reconcil'd in <hi>Dulcinea;</hi> for as for the one, ſhe has not her equal, and few can vie with her in the other: But to cut off all Objections at once, I imagin that all I ſay of her is really ſo, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt addition or diminution: I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy her to be juſt ſuch as I wou'd have her for Beauty and Quality. <hi>Helen</hi> cannot ſtand in competition with her; <hi>Lucretia</hi> cannot rival her, and all the <hi>Heroins</hi> which Antiquity has to boaſt, whether <hi>Greeks, Romans,</hi> or <hi>Barbarians,</hi> are at once out-done by her incomparable Perfections.
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:54446:163"/>
Therefore let the World ſay what it will; ſhou'd the ignorant and vulgar fooliſhly cenſure me, I pleaſe my ſelf with the aſſurances I have of the approbation of Men of the ſtricteſt Morals, and the niceſt Judgment. Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho, I</hi> knock under: You've Reaſon o' your ſide in all you ſay, and I own my ſelf an Aſs. Nay, I'm an Aſs to talk of an Aſs; for 'tis ill talking of Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters i'th Houſe of a Man that was hang'd. But where's the Letter all this while, that I may be jogging? With that <hi>Don Quixote</hi> pull'd out the Table-Book, and retiring a little aſide, he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeriouſly began to write the Letter; which he had no ſooner finiſh'd but he call'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> and order'd him to liſten while he read it over to him, that he might carry it as well in his Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as in the Pocket-Book, in caſe he ſhou'd have the ill luck to loſe it by the way; for he fear'd the worſe of his malignant Fortune. But, Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> tear the Book, and give me two or three Copies, and then I'll be ſure to deliver my Meſſage ſafe enough I warrant ye. For 'tis a folly to think I can ever get it by heart; alas my memory is ſo bad, that many times I forget my own Name. But yet for all that read it out to me, I beſeech you, for I've a hugeous mind to hear it, I dare ſay 'tis as fine as tho 'twere in print. Well then liſten, ſaid <hi>Don Quixote.</hi>

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:54446:165"/>
                              <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> I will have thee ſtay a while <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> and ſee me ſtark naked; 'tis alſo abſolutely neceſſary thou ſhou'dſt ſee me practiſe ſome twenty or thirty mad Gambols; I ſhall have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd 'em in leſs than half an hour: and when thou haſt been an Eye-witneſs of that Eſſay, thou mayſt with a ſafe Conſcience ſwear thou haſt ſeen me play a thouſand raving Tricks; for I dare aſſure thee for thy incouragement, thou never canſt exceed the number of thoſe I ſhall perform. Good Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> as you love me don't let me ſtay to ſee you naked, 'twill grieve me ſo to the heart, that I ſhall cry my eyes out, and I have blubber'd and howl'd but too much ſince yeſternight for the loſs of my poor Aſs; my Head's ſo ſore with it, I a'n't able to cry any longer: But if you'll needs have me ſee ſome of your Anticks, pray do 'em in your Clothes out of hand, and the firſt that come into your Head; for the ſooner I go, the ſooner I ſhall come back, and the way to be gone is not to ſtay here. I long to bring you an Anſwer to your Heart's content: and I'll be ſure to do't, or let the Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi> look to't; for if ſhe dos not do as ſhe ſhou'd do, may old Nick toſs me in his Blanket, if I don't make her give up an anſwer to my mind, with good kicks o'th' Guts, and ſwinging Fiſticuffs on her Jobbernol: For 'tis not to be endur'd, that ſuch a notable Knight-Errant as your Worſhip is ſhou'd thus run out of his Wits without Rime or Reaſon for ſuch a—Odsbobs, I know what I know, ſhe had not beſt provoke me to ſay the reſt: if ſhe dos, I ſhall out with it, and tell her a piece of my mind. In troth, murder will out. I'll make her know her Driver with a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. I'll handle her without Mittius: She ſhall
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:54446:165"/>
find me as cruſty as ſhe's hard bak'd: She muſt not think to put tricks upon Travellers.</p>
                           <p>I proteſt <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> I think thou art grown as mad as my ſelf. Nay, not ſo mad neither, reply'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> but ſomewhat more angry. But talk no more of that: let's ſee, how will you do for Victuals when I'm gon? Do you mean to do like t' other Madman yonder, rob upon the high way, and ſnatch the Goatherds Victuals from 'em by main force? Never let that trouble thy unmannerly Brain, reply'd <hi>Don Quixote;</hi> for tho I had here all the Dainties that can feaſt a luxurious Palat, I wou'd feed upon nothing but the Herbs and Fruits which this Wilderneſs will afford me; for the ſingularity of my preſent Task conſiſts in faſting and half ſtarv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſelf, and in the performance of ſome other Diſcipline. But there's another thing come into my head, quoth <hi>Sancho:</hi> how ſhall I do to find the way hither again, 'tis ſuch a by-place? Take good notice of it beforehand, ſaid <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> and I'll indeavour to keep hereabouts till thy return. Beſides, about the time when I may reaſonably expect thee back, I'll be ſure to watch on the top of yonder high Rock for thy coming. But now I bethink my ſelf of a better Expedient; thou ſhalt cut down a good number of Boughs, and ſtrew 'em in the way as thou rid'ſt along, till thou get'ſt to the Plains, and this will ſerve thee to find me again at thy return, like <hi>Perſeus</hi>'s Clue to get out of the Labyrinth of <hi>Crete.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I'll go about it out of hand, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> with that he went and cut down a Bundle of Boughs, then came and ask'd his Maſter's Bleſſing, and after a ſhower of Tears ſhed on both ſides, mounted <hi>Rozinante,</hi> which <hi>Don Quixote</hi> very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:54446:166"/>
recommended to his care, charging him to be as tender of that excellent Steed as of his own Perſon. After that he ſet forward toward the Plains, ſtrewing ſeveral Boughs as he rid according to order. His Maſter had importun'd him to ſtay and ſee him do two or three of his antic Poſtures before he went, but he cou'd not prevail with him: However before he was got out of ſight he conſider'd of it, and rode back. Sir, quoth he, I've thought better of it, and I believe I had beſt take your advice, that I may ſwear with a ſafe conſcience I've ſeen you play your mad tricks; therefore I wou'd ſee you do one of 'em at leaſt, tho I think I've ſeen you do a very great one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, I mean your ſtaying by your ſelf in this Deſert.</p>
                           <p>I had adviſed thee right, ſaid <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> and therefore ſtay but while a Man may repeat the Creed, and I will ſhew thee what thou woud'ſt ſee. With that, ſlipping off his Breeches, and ſtripping himſelf naked to the waſte, he gave two or three frisks in the Air, and then pitching on his hands, he fetch'd his heels over his head twice together; and, as he tumbled with his Legs aloft, diſcover'd ſuch Rarities, that <hi>Sancho</hi> e'en made haſte to turn his Horſe's Head, that he might no longer ſee 'em, and rode away fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd that he might ſwear his Maſter was mad; and ſo we will leave him to make the beſt of his way, till his return, which will be more ſpeedy than might be imagin'd.</p>

                           </head>
                           <p>THE Hiſtory relates that as ſoon as the Knight of the Woful Countenance ſaw himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, after this firſt exerciſe of frisking and tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, the merry Prelude to his amorous Penance, he aſcended to the top of a high Rock, and there began ſeriouſly to conſider with himſelf what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to take in that nice Dilemma which had already ſo perplex'd his mind; that is, whether he ſhould imitate <hi>Orlando</hi> in his extraordinary Fury, or <hi>Amadis</hi> in his melancholic Extravagancies. To which purpoſe, diſcourſing with himſelf, I do not much wonder, ſaid he, at <hi>Orlando</hi>'s being ſo very valiant, conſidering he was inchanted in ſuch a manner, that he cou'd not be ſlain but by the thruſt of a Pin thro the bottom of his Foot, which he ſufficiently ſecur'd, always wearing ſeven iron Soles to his Shoes: and yet this avail d him nothing againſt <hi>Bernardo del Carpio,</hi> who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his Enchantment, ſqueez'd him to death between his arms at <hi>Ronce valles.</hi> But ſetting aſide his Valour, let us examine his madneſs; for that he was mad, is an unqueſtionable truth, nor is it leſs certain that his Frenzy was occaſion'd by the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:54446:167"/>
aſſurances he had that the fair <hi>Angelica</hi> had reſign'd her ſelf up to the unlawful Embraces of <hi>Medor,</hi> that young Moor with curl'd Locks, who was Page to <hi>Agramant.</hi> Now after all, ſeeing he was too well convinc'd of his Lady's Infidelity, 'tis not to be admir'd he ſhou'd run mad. But how can I imitate him in his Furys, if I cannot imitate him in their occaſion? For I dare ſwear, my <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo</hi> never ſaw ſuch a Moor ſince ſhe firſt beheld the Light, and ſhe's now the very ſame ſhe was when her Mother bleſt the World with her Birth: So that I ſhou'd do her a great Injury ſhou'd I entertain any diſhonourable Thoughts of her Behaviour, and launch into that wild Ocean of madneſs that toſs'd <hi>Orlando</hi>'s Soul. On the other ſide, I find that <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> without puniſhing himſelf with ſuch a Diſtraction, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing his Reſentments in ſo boiſterous and rav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a manner, got a, great a Reputation for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Lover as any one whatſoever: For what I find in Hiſtory as to his abandoning himſelf to ſorrow is only this: He found himſelf diſdain'd, his Lady <hi>Oriana</hi> having charg'd him to get out of her ſight, and not preſume to appear in her preſence till ſhe gave him leave; and this was the true Reaſon why he retir'd to the <hi>poor Rock</hi> with the Hermit, where he gave up himſelf wholly to grief, and wept a Deluge of Tears, till pitying Heaven at laſt commiſerating his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction ſent him relief in the height of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh. Now then ſince this is true, as I know it is, what need have I to tear off my Clothes, to rend and root up theſe harmleſs Trees, or trouble the clear Water of theſe Brooks, that muſt give me Drink when I am thirſty? No, long live the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:54446:167"/>
Memory of <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> and let him be the great Exemplar which <hi>Don Quixote de la Mancha</hi> chuſes to imitate in all things that will admit of a Parallel. So may it be ſaid of the living Copy as was ſaid of the dead Original, that if he did not perform great things, yet no Man was more ambitious of undertaking 'em than he: And tho I am not diſdain'd nor diſcard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by my <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> yet 'tis ſufficient that I am abſent from her. Then 'tis reſolv'd! And now ye famous Actions of the great <hi>Amadis,</hi> occur to my remembrance, and be my truſty guides to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Example. This ſaid, he call'd to mind that the chief exerciſe of that Hero in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat was Prayer: To which purpoſe our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Amadis</hi> preſently went and made himſelf a Roſary of Gauls or Acorns inſtead of Beads; but he was extreamly troubled for want of an Hermit to hear his Confeſſion, and comfort him in his Affliction. However he entertain'd himſelf with his amorous Contemplations, walking up and down the Meadow, and writing ſome Poetical Conceptions in the ſmooth Sand, and upon the Bark of Trees, all of 'em expreſſive of his Sorrows, and the Praiſes of <hi>Dulcinea.</hi> But unhappily none were found entire and legible but theſe STANZA'S that follow.</p>

With this Employment did our diſconſolate Knight beguile ſome tedious hours. Sometimes alſo he expreſs'd his Sorrows in Proſe, ſigh'd to the Winds, and call'd upon the <hi>Sylvan</hi> Gods, the <hi>Fauns,</hi> the <hi>Naiades,</hi> the Nymphs of adjoining Groves, and the mournful Eccho, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring their Attention and Condolement with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Supplications: at other Times he employ'd himſelf in gathering Herbs for the ſupport of languiſhing Nature, which decay'd ſo faſt, what with this ſlender Diet, and what with his ſtudied anxiety and intenſeneſs of Thinking, that had <hi>Sancho</hi> ſtay'd but three Weeks from him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as by good Fortune he ſtaid but three Days, the Knight of the woful Countenance wou'd have been reduc'd to that meager and diſmal Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that his very Mother wou'd never have known the Child of her own Womb.</p>
                           <p>But now 'tis neceſſary we ſhou'd leave him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while to his Sighs, his Sobs, and his amorous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulations, and ſee how <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> behav'd himſelf in his Embaſſy. He made all the haſte he cou'd to get out of the Mountain, and then taking the direct Road to <hi>Toboſo,</hi> the next Day he arriv'd near the Inn where he had been toſs'd in a Blanket. Scarce had he deſcry'd the fatal Walls, but a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſhivering ſeiz'd his Bones, and he fancied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be again dancing in the Air; ſo that he had
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:54446:169"/>
a good mind to have rode further before he bait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, tho 'twere Dinner time, and his Mouth water'd ſtrangely at the thoughts of a hot bit of Meat, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as he had liv'd altogether upon cold Victuals for a long while. This greedy longing drew him near the Inn in ſpight of his averſion to the Place; but yet when he came to the Gate, he had not the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to go in, but ſtop'd there, not knowing whether he had beſt enter or no. While he ſate muſing, two men happen'd to come out, and believing they knew him, look, cry'd one to the other, is not that <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> whom the Houſe-keeper told us her Maſter had inveigled to go along with him? The ſame, anſwer'd the other; and more than that, he rides on <hi>Don Quixote</hi>'s Horſe. Now theſe two happen'd to be the Curate and the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, who had brought his Books to a Trial, and paſs'd Sentence on 'em: Therefore they had no ſooner ſaid this, but they call'd to <hi>Sancho,</hi> and ask'd him where he had left his Maſter? The truſty Squire preſently knew 'em, and having no mind to diſcover his Maſter's Condition, told 'em his Maſter was taken up with Buſineſs of great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence at a certain Place, which he durſt not diſcover for his Life. No, no, <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> cry'd the Barber, you muſt not think to put us off with a flim flam. Story; if you won't tell us where he is, we ſhall believe you have murder'd him and robb'd him of his Horſe; therefore ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſatisfy us where you've left him, or we'll have you lay'd by the Heels. Look you Neighbour, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I a'n't afraid of Words d'ye ſee; I am neither a Thief nor a Manſlayer; I kill no Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſo no Body kill me; I leave every man to fall by his own Fortune, or by the hand of him that made him. As for my Maſter, I left him a frisk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:54446:169"/>
and doing Penance in the midſt of you Mountain to his heart's Content. After this, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further entreaty, he gave 'em a full Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that Buſineſs, and of all their Adventures, how he was then going from his Maſter to carry a Letter to my Lady <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo, Lorenzo Corchuelo</hi>'s Daughter, with whom he was up to the ears in Love. The Curate and the Barber ſtood amaz'd hearing all theſe particulars; and tho they already knew <hi>Don Quixote</hi>'s madneſs but too well, they wonder'd more and more at the encreaſe of it, and at ſo ſtrange a Caſt and variety of Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance. Then they deſir'd <hi>Sancho</hi> to ſhow 'em the Letter: He told 'em 'twas written in a Pocket-Book, and that his Maſter had order'd him to get it fairly tranſcrib'd upon Paper at the next Village he ſhould come at. Whereupon the Curate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to write it out very fairly himſelf, <hi>Sancho</hi> put his Hand in his Boſom to give him the Table-Book; but tho he fumbled a great while for't, he could not find it there, he look'd, and look'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but it had been all in vain, tho he had ſearch'd till Doom's-day; for he came away from <hi>Don Quixote</hi> without it. This put him into a cold Sweat, and made him turn as pale as Death; he fell a ſearching all his Clothes, turn'd his Pockets in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide outwards, fumbled in his Boſom again: but being at laſt convinc'd he had it not about him, he fell a raving and ſtamping, and curſing himſelf like a Madman; he rent his Beard from his Chin with both hands, befiſted his own forgetful Scull, and his blubber Cheeks, and gave himſelf a bloody Noſe in a Moment. The Curate and the Barber ask'd him what was the matter with him, and why he puniſh'd himſelf at that ſtrange rate? I deſerve it all, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> like a buffle headed, cockle
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:54446:170"/>
brain'd Moon-calf as I am, for loſing at one Caſt no leſs than three Aſſes, whereof the leaſt was worth a Caſtle. How ſo, quoth the Barber? Why, cry'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> I've loſt that ſame Table-Book, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was written <hi>Dulcinea</hi>'s Letter, and a Bill of Exchange drawn by my Maſter upon his Niece for three of the five Aſſes which he has at home; and with that he told 'em how he had loſt his own. But the Vicar cheer'd him up, and promis'd him to get him another Bill of Exchange from his Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, written upon Paper, whereas that in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Book not being in due form, would not have been accepted. With that <hi>Sancho</hi> took Courage, and told 'em if it were ſo, he car'd not a ſtraw for the loſs of <hi>Dulcinea</hi>'s Letter, for he knew it almoſt all by Rote. Then prethee let's hear it, ſaid the Barber, and we'll ſee and write it. In order to this <hi>Sancho</hi> paus'd and began to ſtudy for the words; preſently he fell a ſcratching his thick Scull, he ſtood firſt upon one Leg, then upon another, gap'd upon the Skies, ſcowl'd upon the Ground, knit his Brows, rub'd his Forehead, lay'd one hand upon his Eyes, and bit his Nails with the other; and at laſt after he had gnaw'd almoſt half of 'em, and kept the Curate and the Barber a long while waiting to hear this rare Letter repeated; odſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigs, cry'd he, good Mr. Doctor, the Devil's in't! May I be choak'd if I can remember a word of this confounded Letter, but only that there was at the beginning, <hi>High and ſubterrane Lady; So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign or ſuperhuman Lady,</hi> you wou'd ſay, quoth the Barber. Ay Gaffer, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> you're in the right—But ſtay now, I think I can remember ſome of that which follow'd; ho! I have it, I ha't now—<hi>He that is wounded, and wants Sleep, ſends you the Dagger — which he wants himſelf — that
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:54446:170"/>
ſtabb'd him to the Heart—and the Hurtman does kiſs your Worſhip's Hands—with my Deſire—ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt</hi> Dulcinea del Toboſo; and thus he went on rambling a good while with I don't know what more of <hi>fainting</hi> and <hi>Relief,</hi> and <hi>ſinking,</hi> till at laſt he ended with <hi>Yours till Death, The Knight of the Woful Countenance.</hi> The Curate and the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber were mightily pleas'd with <hi>Sancho</hi>'s excellent Memory, inſomuch that they deſir'd him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the Letter twice or thrice more, that they might alſo get it by heart, and write it down, which <hi>Sancho</hi> did very freely; but, every time, he made many odd Alterations and Additions, as pleaſant as the firſt. Then he told 'em many other Things of his Maſter, but ſpoke not a word of his own being toſs'd in a Blanket at that very Inn: He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo told 'em that if he brought a kind Anſwer from the Lady <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> his Maſter wou'd forthwith ſet out to ſee and make himſelf an Emperor, or at leaſt a King; for ſo they two had agreed between themſelves, he ſaid, and that after all 'twas a mighty eaſy matter for his Maſter to become one, ſuch was his Proweſs and the ſtrength of his Arm. Which being done, his Maſter wou'd marry him to one of the Empreſſe's Damſels, and that fine Lady was to be Heireſs to a large County on the main Land, but not to any Iſland or Iſlands, for he was weary of 'em. Poor <hi>Sancho</hi> ſpoke all this ſo ſeriouſly, and ſo feelingly, ever and anon rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing his Noſe, and ſtroking his Beard, that now the Curate and the Barber were more ſurpriz'd than they were before, conſidering the prevalent Influences of <hi>Don Quixote</hi>'s Folly upon that ſilly credulous Fellow. However they did not think it worth their while to undeceive him yet, ſeeing this was only a harmleſs Deluſion that might di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:54446:171"/>
'em a while; and therefore they exhorted him to pray for his Maſter's Health and long Life, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was no impoſſible thing but that he might in time become an Emperor by his Valour, a Cardinal, or an Archbiſhop at leaſt by his Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                           <p>But pray, good Mr. Doctor, ask'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſhou'd my Maſter have no mind to be an Emperor, and take a fancy to be an Archbiſhop, I wou'd fain know what your Archbiſhops-Errant are wont to give their Squires? Why, anſwer'd the Curate, they uſe to give 'em ſome Parſonage, or Prebend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, or ſome ſuch other Benefice or Church-Living: which, with the profits of the Altar, and other Fees, brings 'em in a handſom Revenue. Ay, but ſays <hi>Sancho,</hi> to put in for that, the Squire muſt be a ſingle man, and know how to anſwer and aſſiſt at Maſs at leaſt; and how ſhall I do then, ſeeing I have the ill luck to be ſped? nay and beſides I don't ſo much as know the firſt Letter of my Chriſt-croſs-row? What will become of me ſhou'd it come into my Maſter's Head to make himſelf an Archbiſhop, and not an Emperor, as 'tis the Cuſtom of Knights-Errant? Don't let that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thee, friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid the Barber, we'll talk to him about it, and adviſe him, nay urge it to him as a point of Conſcience to be an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and not an Archbiſhop, which will be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for him, by reaſon he has more Courage than Learning.</p>
                           <p>Troth, I'm of your Mind, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> tho he's ſuch a Head-piece that I dare ſay he can turn himſelf to any thing. Ne'ertheleſs I mean to make it the burden of my Prayers, that Heaven may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect him to that which is beſt for him, and what may enable him to reward me moſt. You ſpeak like a
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:54446:171"/>
wiſe man, and a good Chriſtian, ſaid the Curate: But all we have to do at preſent, is to ſee how we ſhall do to get your Maſter to give over that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere unprofitable Penance which he has undertaken. And therefore let's go in to conſider about it, and alſo to eat our Dinner, for I fancy 'tis ready by this Time. Do you two go in, if you pleaſe, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but as for me I had rather ſtay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and anon I'll tell you why I don't care to go in a Doors: however pray ſend me out a bit of hot Victuals to eat here, and ſome Provender for <hi>Rozinante.</hi> With that they went in, and a while after the Barber brought him out his Dinner, and returning to the Curate they conſulted how to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs their Deſign. At laſt the latter luckily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought himſelf of an Expedient that ſeem'd moſt likely to take, as exactly fitting <hi>Don Quixote</hi>'s Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; which was, that he ſhou'd diſguiſe himſelf in the habit of a Damſel-Errant, and the Barber ſhou'd alter his Dreſs as well as he cou'd, ſo as to paſs for his Squire, or Gentleman-Uſher. In that Equipage, added he, we will go to <hi>Don Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote;</hi> and feigning my ſelf to be a diſtreſs'd Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, I will beg a <hi>Boon</hi> of him, which he as a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous Knight-Errant, will not fail to promiſe me. By this means I will engage him to go with me to redreſs a very great Injury done me by a <hi>falſe and diſcourteous</hi> Knight; beſeeching him not to deſire to ſee my Face, nor to ask me any thing about my Circumſtances till he has reveng'd me on that wicked Knight. This bait will take, I dare en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, and by this Stratagem we'll decoy him back to his own Houſe, where we'll try to cure him of his romantic Frenzy.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> How the Curat and the Barber put their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in execution: With other things wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be recorded in this Important Hiſtory.</head>
                           <p>THE Curat's Project was ſo well lik'd by the Barber, that they inſtantly put it into pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. Firſt, They borrow'd a compleat Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Apparel of the Hoſteſs, leaving her in Pawn a new Caſſock of the Curat's; and the Barber made himſelf a long Beard with a grizled Ox's Tail, in which the Innkeeper us'd to hang his Combs. The Hoſteſs being deſirous to know what they intended to do with thoſe things, the Curat gave her a ſhort account of <hi>Don Quixote</hi>'s Diſtraction, and their Deſign: Whereupon the Innkeeper and his Wife preſently gueſt this was their Romantick Knight that made the precious Balſam; and accordingly they told 'em the whole ſtory of <hi>Don Quixote</hi>'s lodging there, and of <hi>Sancho</hi>'s being toſs'd in a Blanket: Which done, the Hoſteſs readily fitted out the Curat at ſuch a rate, that 'twou'd have pleas'd any one to have ſeen him; for ſhe dreſs'd him up in a Cloth Gown trimm'd with Borders of black Velvet, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, one the breadth of a Span, all pink'd and jagg'd, and a pair of green Velvet Bodice, with Sleeves of the ſame, and fac'd with white Satin; which Accoutrem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>nts probably had been in faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:54446:172"/>
in old Queen <hi>Bamba</hi>'s Days. The Curat would not let her encomber his Head with Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Headgeer, but only clapp'd upon his Crown a white quilted Cap which he us'd to wear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nights, and bound his Forehead with one of his Garters that was of black Taffety, making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a kind of a Muffler and Vizard-Mask with the other. Then he half buried his Head under his Hat, pulling it down to ſqueeze in his Ears; and as the broad Brim flapp'd down over his Eyes, it ſeem'd a kind of Umbrella. This done, he wrapp'd himſelf up in his long Cloke, and up he got upon his Side-Saddle like a Woman. Then the Barber clapt on his Ox-tail Beard, half red, half grizzled, which hung from his Chin down to his Waſte: and having mounted his Mule, they took leave of their Hoſt and Hoſteſs, as alſo of the good, condition'd. <hi>Maritornes,</hi> who vow'd, tho ſhe was a Sinner, to tumble her Beads and ſay a <hi>Roſary</hi> to their Intention.</p>
                           <p>But ſcarce were they got out of the Inn, when the Curat began to be troubled with a Scruple of Conſcience about his putting on Woman's Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, being apprehenſive of the Indecency of the Diſguiſe in a Prieſt, tho the goodneſs of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent might well warrant a Diſpenſation from the ſtrictneſs of Decorum: Therefore he deſir'd the Barber that they might change Dreſſes, thinking that in his Habit of a Squire he ſhou'd leſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane his own Dignity and Character, to which after all he ought to have a greater regard than to <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> withal aſſuring the Barber, that unleſs he conſented to this exchange, he was abſolutely reſolv'd to go no further. <hi>Sancho</hi> came up with 'em juſt upon this Demur, and was ready to ſplit his ſides with laughing at the ſight of thoſe ſtrange
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:54446:173"/>
Maſqueraders. In ſhort, the Barber conſented to be the Damoſel, and to let the Curat be the Squire. Now while they were thus changing Sexes, the Curat offer'd to tutor him how to behave himſelf in that Female Attire, ſo as to be able to wheedle <hi>Don Quixote</hi> out of his Penance. But the Barber deſir'd him not to trouble himſelf about that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, aſſuring him that he was well enough vers'd in Female Affairs to be able to act a Damoſel without any directions. However, he ſaid he would not now ſtand fiddling and managing his Pins to prink himſelf up, ſeeing 'twou'd be time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to do that when they came near <hi>Don Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote</hi>'s Hermitage; and therefore having folded up his Clothes, and the Curat his Beard, they ſpurr'd on, while their Guide <hi>Sancho</hi> entertain'd 'em with a Relation of the mad tatter'd Gentleman whom they had met in the Mountain; however without mentioning a word of the Portmanteau, or the Gold: For as much a Fool as he was, he lov'd to keep Money when he had it, and was wiſe enough to keep his own Counſel.</p>
                           <p>They got next day to the place where <hi>Sancho</hi> had ſtrew'd the Boughs to direct him to <hi>Don Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote,</hi> and therefore he advis'd 'em to put on their Diſguiſes, if 'twere as they told him, that their Deſign was only to make his Maſter leave that wretched kind of Life in order to become an Emperor. Thereupon they charg'd him on his Life not to take the leaſt notice who they were. As for <hi>Dulcinea</hi>'s Letter, if <hi>Don Quixote</hi> ask'd him about it, they order'd him to ſay he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd it; but that by reaſon ſhe cou'd neither write nor read, ſhe had ſent him her anſwer by word of Mouth, which was, that on pain of her
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:54446:173"/>
Indignation he ſhou'd immediatly put an end to his ſevere Penance, and repair to her Preſence. This they told <hi>Sancho,</hi> together with what they themſelves deſign'd to ſay, was the only way to oblige his Maſter to leave the Deſart, that he might proſecute his Deſign of making himſelf an Emperor, aſſuring him they wou'd take care he ſhou'd not entertain the leaſt thought of an Archbiſhoprick.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Sancho</hi> liſten'd with great attention to all theſe Inſtructions, and treaſur'd 'em up in his mind, giving the Curat and the Barber a world of Thanks for their good Intention, of adviſing his Maſter to become an Emperor, and not an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop; for, as he ſaid, he imagin'd, in his ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Judgment, that an Emperor-Errant was ten times better than a ſneaking Archbiſhop-Errant, and cou'd reward his Squire a great deal bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                           <p>He likewiſe added, that he thought it wou'd be better for him to go to his Maſter ſomewhat before 'em, and give him an account of his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's kind Anſwer; for perhaps that alone wou'd be ſufficient to fetch him out of that place, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out putting 'em to any further trouble. They lik'd this Propoſal very well, and therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to let him go, and wait there till he came back to give 'em an account of his Succeſs. With that <hi>Sancho</hi> rode away, and ſtruck into the Clefts of the Rocks in order to ſeek out his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, leaving the Curat and the Barber by the ſide of a Brook, where the neighbouring Hills, and ſome Trees that grew along its Banks, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin'd to make a cool and pleaſant Shade. There they ſhelter'd themſelves from the ſcorching Beams of the Sun that commonly ſhines intolerably hot

While they quietly refreſh'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in that delightful place, where they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to ſtay till <hi>Sancho</hi>'s return, they heard a Voice, which tho unattended with any Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, raviſh'd their Ears with its melodious ſound. And what increas'd their ſurpriſe and their admiration was, to hear ſuch artful Notes, and ſuch delicate Muſic, in ſo unfrequented and wild a place, where ſcarce any Ruſtics ever ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, much leſs ſuch skilful Songſters as the Perſon whom they heard unqueſtionably was. For tho the Poets are pleas'd to fill the Fields and Woods with Swains and Shepherdeſſes that ſing with all the ſweetneſs and delicacy imaginable, yet 'tis well enough known that thoſe Gentlemen deal more in Fiction than in Truth, and love to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſh the Deſcriptions they make. Nor cou'd our two liſtning Travellers think it the Voice of a Peaſant when they began to diſtinguiſh the Words of the Song; for they ſeem'd to reliſh more of a Courtly Stile than of a Rural Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. Theſe were the Verſes.</p>

Therefore, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, if you come here with that deſign, I beg that before you give your ſelves the trouble of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving or adviſing me, you will be pleaſed to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the Relation of my Calamities. For perhaps when you've heard it you will think 'em paſt Redreſs, and ſo will ſave your ſelves the labour you wou'd take.

This unuſual Scene of Sorrow ſtrangely amaz'd and mov'd me; yet becauſe I wou'd not murther hope, I choſe to attribute this to the tenderneſs of her Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and unwillingneſs to part with me.

For to my Sorrow he enjoyn'd me to tarry a whole Week, and to take care the Duke might not ſee me, his Brother having ſent for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney unknown to his Father. But this was only a Device of falſe <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s; for his Brother did not want Money, and might have diſpatch'd me imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, had he not been privately deſir'd to defer my Return.</p>
                           <p>This was ſo diſpleaſing an Injunction that I was ready to have come away without the Money, not being able to live ſo long abſent from my <hi>Lucinda,</hi> principally conſidering in what Condition I had left her. Yet at laſt I forc'd my ſelf to ſtay, and my reſpect for my Friend prevail'd over my Impatience. But e're four tedious Days were expir'd, a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger brought me a Letter which I preſently knew to be <hi>Lucinda</hi>'s Hand. I open'd it with trembling Hands and an aking Heart, juſtly imagining it was no ordinary Concern that cou'd urge her to ſend thither to me. And before I read it I ask'd the Meſſenger who had given't him; he anſwer'd me that, going by accidentally in the Street about Noo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This Reward, but much more that beautiful Lady's Tears and earneſt Prayers, made me poſt away to you that very Minute, and ſo in ſixteen hours, I have travell'd Eighteen long Leagues. While the Meſſenger ſpoke, I was ſeiz'd with ſad Apprehenſions of ſome fatal News, and ſuch a trembling ſhook my Limbs, that I cou'd ſcarce ſupport my fainting Body. However, taking Courage, at laſt I read the Letter; the Contents of which were theſe.</p>

But what Man of Aſſurance dares but pretend to know thorowly the Riddle of a Woman's Mind, and who cou'd ever hope to fix her mutable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? <hi>Cardenio,</hi> ſaid <hi>Lucinda</hi> to me, my Wedding Clothes are on, and the perfidious <hi>Ferdinand</hi> with my covetous Father, and the reſt ſtay for me in the Hall, to perform the Marriage Rites; but they ſhall ſooner be Witneſſes of my Death than of my Nuptials.

Madam, cry'd I to her with Precipitation, and ſo diſorder'd that I did not know what I ſaid, let your Actions verify your Words. Let us leave nothing unattempted that may ſerve our common Intereſts; and I aſſure you, if my Sword does not defend 'em well, I will turn it upon my own Breaſt, rather than outlive my Diſappointment. I cannot tell whether <hi>Lucinda</hi> heard me, for ſhe was call'd away in great haſte, the Bride-Groom impatiently expecting her. My Spirit forſook me when ſhe left me, and my Sorrow and Confuſion cannot be expreſs'd. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought I ſaw the Sun ſet for ever; and my Eyes and my Senſes partaking of my Diſtraction, I cou'd not ſo much as ſpy the Door to go into the Houſe, and ſeem'd rooted to the place where I ſtood. But at laſt the Conſideration of my Love having rous'd me out of this ſtupifying Aſtoniſhment, I got into the Houſe without being diſcover'd, every thing being there in a hurry; and going into the Hall I hid my ſelf behind the Hangings, where two pieces of Tapſtry met, and gave me liberty to ſee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being ſeen. Who can deſcribe the various Thoughts, the Doubts, the Fears, the Anguiſh, that perplex'd and toſs'd my Soul while I ſtood waiting there! <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> enter'd the Hall not like a Bride-Groom, but in his uſual Habit, with only a Couſin German of <hi>Lucinda</hi>'s, the reſt were the People of the Houſe. Some time after came <hi>Lucinda</hi> her ſelf, with her Mother, and two wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Women. I perceiv'd ſhe was as richly dreſt as was conſiſtent with her Quality, and the ſolemnity of the Ceremony; but the Diſtraction that poſſeſs'd my Soul lent me no time to note particularly the Apparel ſhe had on. I only mark'd the Colours that were Carnation and White, and the ſplendor of the Jewels that enrich'd her Dreſs in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:54446:180"/>
but nothing equal'd the luſtre of her Beauty that adorn'd her Perſon much more than all thoſe Ornaments. Oh Memory, thou fatal Enemy of my Eaſe, why doſt thou now ſo faithfully repreſent to the Eyes of my Mind <hi>Lucinda</hi>'s incomparable Charms? Why doſt thou not rather ſhow me what ſhe did then, that mov'd by ſo provoking a Wrong, I may indeavour to revenge it, or at leaſt to dye! Forgive me theſe tedious Digreſſions, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen! Alas, my Woes are none of thoſe that can or ought to be related with Brevity; for to me every Circumſtance ſeems worthy to be enlarg d upon.</p>
                           <p>The Curate aſſur'd <hi>Cardenio,</hi> that they attended every word with a mournful Pleaſure that made 'em greedy of hearing the leaſt Paſſage. With that, <hi>Cardenio</hi> went on. All Parties being met, ſaid he, the Prieſt enter'd, and taking the young Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by the Hands, he ask'd <hi>Lucinda</hi> whether ſhe were willing to take <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> for her Wedded Husband? With that, I thruſt out my Head from between the two pieces of Tapſtry, liſtening with anxious Heart to hear her anſwer, upon which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended my Life and Happineſs. Dull heartleſs Wretch that I was! Why did I not then ſhew my ſelf! why did I not call to her aloud, Conſider what thou doſt <hi>Lucinda,</hi> thou art mine, and can'ſt not be another Man's: Nor can'ſt thou ſpeak now the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Yes, without injuring Heaven, thy ſelf and me, and murthering thy <hi>Cardenio.</hi> And thou, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who dar'ſt to violate all Rights, both human and divine, to rob me of my Treaſure: Can'ſt thou hope to deprive me with impunity of the comfort of my Life? Or think'ſt thou that any Conſideration can ſtifle my Reſentments when my Honour and my Love lye at ſtake? Fool that I am!
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:54446:180"/>
now that 'tis too late, and danger is far diſtant, I ſay what I ſhou'd have done, and not what I did then: After I've ſuffer'd the Treaſure of my Soul to be ſtolen, I exclaim againſt the Thief whom I might have puniſh'd for the baſe Attempt, had I had but ſo much Reſolution to revenge, as I have now to complain. Then let me rather accuſe my faint Heart that durſt not do me right, and let me dye here like a Wretch void both of Senſe and Honour, the outcaſt of Society and Nature. The Prieſt ſtood waiting for <hi>Lucinda</hi>'s Anſwer a good while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe gave it; and all that time I expected ſhe wou'd have pull'd out her Dagger, or unloos'd her Tongue to plead her former Engagement to me. But alas to my eternal Diſappointment I heard her at laſt with a feeble Voice pronounce the fatal <hi>Yes;</hi> and then <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> ſaying the ſame, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her the Ring, the ſacred Knot was ty'd, which Death alone can diſſolve. Then did the faithleſs Bridegroom advance to embrace his Bride, but ſhe laying her Hand upon her Heart, in that very Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſwoon'd away in her Mother's Arms. Oh what Confuſion ſeiz'd me, what Pangs, what Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments rack'd my Soul, ſeeing the Falſhood of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinda</hi>'s Promiſes, all my hopes ſhipwrack'd, and the only thing that made me wiſh to live, for ever ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh'd from me! Confounded and deſpairing, I look'd upon my ſelf as abandon'd by Heaven to the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of my Deſtiny; and the Violence of my Grief ſtifling my Sighs, and denying a paſſage to my Tears, I felt my ſelf transfix'd with killing Anguiſh, and burning with jealous Rage and Vengeance. In the mean time the whole Company was troubled at <hi>Lucinda</hi>'s ſwooning; and as her Mother unclaſp'd her Gown before, to give her Air, a folded Paper was found in her Boſom, which <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:54446:181"/>
ſnatch'd, then ſtepping a little aſide, he open'd it and read it by the light of one of the Tapers. And as ſoon as he had done, he as it were, let himſelf fall upon a Chair, and there he ſat with his Hand upon the ſide of his Face, with all the ſigns of Melancholy and Diſcontent, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of his Bride as if he had been inſenſible of her Accident. For my own part, ſeeing all the Houſe thus in an uproar, I reſolv'd to leave the hated Place without caring whether I were ſeen or not, and, in caſe I were perceiv'd to act ſuch a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate part in puniſhing the Traytor <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> that the World ſhou'd at once be inform'd of his Perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and the Severity of my juſt Reſentment. But my Deſtiny that reſerv'd me for more laſting Woes, allow'd me then the uſe of that ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of my Senſes, which afterwards quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook me: So that I left the Houſe without reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging my ſelf on my Enemies, whom I cou'd have eaſily ſacrific'd to my Rage in this unexpected Diſorder; and I choſe to inflict upon my ſelf for my Credulity, the Puniſhment which their Infidelity deſerv'd. I went to the Meſſengers Houſe where I had left my Mule, and without ſo much as bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him adieu, I mounted and left the Town like another <hi>Lot</hi> without turning to give it a parting look; and as I rode along the Fields, Darkneſs and Silence round me, I vented my Paſſion in Execrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt the treacherous <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and in as loud Complaints of <hi>Lucinda</hi>'s breach of Vows and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude. Thus abandoning my ſelf to theſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous Thoughts, I rode on all that Night, and about break of Day I ſtruck into one of the Paſſes that lead into theſe Mountains; where I wander'd for three Days together without keeping any Road, till at laſt coming to a certain Vally that lies ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:54446:181"/>
where hereabouts, I met ſome Shepherds of whom I enquir'd the way to the moſt craggy and inacceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible part of theſe Rocks. They directed me, and I made all the haſte I cou'd to get thither, reſolv'd to linger out my hated Life far from the Converſe of falſe ungrateful Mankind. When I came among thoſe Deſarts, my Mule through wearineſs and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger fell down dead, and I my ſelf was ſo weak, ſo tir'd and dejected, being almoſt famiſh'd, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all deſtitute and careleſs of Relief, that I ſoon laid my ſelf down, or rather fainted on the Ground, where I lay a conſiderable while, I don't know how long, extended like a Corps. When I came to my ſelf again, I got up, and cou'd not perceive I had any Appetite to eat: I found ſome Goatherds by me who, I ſuppoſe, had given me ſome Suſtenance, tho I were not ſenſible of their Relief. For they told me in what a wretched Condition they found me, ſtaring and talking ſo ſtrangely, that they judg'd I had quite loſt my Senſes. I have indeed ſince that had but too much cauſe to think that my Reaſon ſometimes leaves me, and that I commit thoſe Extravagances which are only the Effects of ſenſeleſs Rage and Frenzy, tearing my Clothes, howling thro' theſe Deſarts, filling the Air with Curſes and Lamentations, and idly repeating a thouſand times <hi>Lucinda</hi>'s Name, all my Wiſhes at that time being to breath out my Soul with the dear Word upon my Lips; and when I come to my ſelf, I am commonly ſo weak and ſo weary, that I am ſcarce able to ſtir. As for my place of Abode, 'tis uſually ſome hollow Cork-Tree, into which I creep at Night; and there thoſe few Goatherds whoſe Cattle browſe on the neighbouring Mountains out of pity and Chriſtian Charity, ſometimes leave ſome Victuals for the ſupport of my miſerable Life.
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:54446:182"/>
For even when my Reaſon is abſent, Nature per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms its animal Functions, and Inſtinct guides me to ſatisfy it. Sometimes theſe good People meet me in my lucid Intervals, and chide me for taking that from 'em by force and by ſurprize, which they are always ſo ready to give me willingly; for which Violence I can make no other excuſe but the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of my Diſtraction. Thus muſt I drag a miſerable Being, till Heaven, pitying my Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, will either put a Period to my Life, or blot out of my Memory perjur'd <hi>Lucinda</hi>'s Beauty and Ingratitude, and <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s Perfidiouſneſs. Cou'd I but be ſo happy e're I dye, I might then hope to be able in time to compoſe my frantick Thoughts: but if I muſt deſpair of ſuch a Favour, I have no other way but to recommend my Soul to Heaven's Mercy; for I am not able to extricate my Body nor my Mind out of that Miſery, in which I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily plung'd my ſelf.</p>
                           <p>Thus, Gentlemen, I have given you a faithful account of my Misfortunes. Judg now whether 'twas poſſible I ſhou'd relate 'em with leſs Concern. And pray do not loſe time to preſcribe Remedies to a Patient who will make uſe of none. I will and can have no health without <hi>Lucinda:</hi> Since ſhe forſakes me, I muſt dye: She has convinc'd me by her Infidelity that ſhe deſires my ruin; and, by my unparallel'd Sufferings, to the laſt I will ſtrive to convince her I deſerv'd a better Fate. Let me then ſuffer on, and may I be the only unhappy Creature whom Deſpair cou'd not relieve, while the Impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of receiving. Comfort moves a Cure to ſo many other Wretches.</p>
                           <p>Here <hi>Cardenio</hi> made an end of his mournful Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and juſt as the Curate was preparing to give him ſome proper Conſolation, he was prevented by the
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:54446:182"/>
doleful Accents of another Complaint that engag'd 'em to new Attention. That the account of that Adventure is reſerv'd for the fourth Book of this Hiſtory; for our Wiſe and Judicious Hiſtorian <hi>Cid Hamet Benengeli</hi> puts here a Period to the third.</p>

                     <p>IT was the Practice of moſt Authors in the laſt Age, to prefix their own Pictures to their Books; but our preſent Writers, much happier in their Politicks, have choſen to ſet off their Productions with nobler Frontiſpieces, prefixing the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figies of Perſons of Quality and
<pb facs="tcp:54446:185"/>
Merit to recommend their Works to the World. This Practice, Sir, though very prudent, is in many Caſes very preſumptuous. To draw in the Wit and Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a fine Gentleman to patronize the Impertinence and Folly of ſome inſipid Piece, may bring the Patron's Merit, and the Author's Modeſty, very much in Queſtion. But here, Sir, I make bold to ſay, that I have ſuited my Book to my Patron. The great <hi>Cervantes</hi> begs the Protection of the Noble Mr. <hi>Coke.</hi> The fineſt Flowers, principally thoſe of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Growth, require the higheſt Shelter and the warmeſt Sun. Then where ſhould Wit fly in theſe tempeſtuous Times, but where the Nobility and Greatneſs
<pb facs="tcp:54446:185"/>
of a Houſe may protect it from the Storm; where a generous Hoſpitality emboldens it to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude, and the Warmth of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune may cheriſh and enliven it? The Bleſſing of a plentiful Eſtate ſets you above all Anxieties in this Life, and the Riches of your Mind ſecure your Happineſs in the future. To double your For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, you have a charming and vertuous Partner to ſhare it: She makes your Life truly happy, for your Deſires are at home. There <hi>Cervantes</hi> expects a candid Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he knows that where the Mind is eaſie, the Sentiments will be mild; he chuſes to be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained where he ſhall find no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions but what are innocent and ingenious, like his own.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:54446:186"/>Your youthful Thoughts have been ſo improv'd by converſing with the beſt Authors, that what is the Study of others, is now your Recreation; and thoſe Years, which among many are thrown away in ſuperficial Vanities, were by you employ'd in admiring the authentick Worthies of Hiſtory, and in modelling your Life by their great Examples. Among other Obſervations that you have made on this Subject, you found, that the greateſt Men have ſtill been the greateſt Patrons. Hence flows your Candour and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Favour to Wit and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and from hence the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Stage finds the Benefit of your generous Support. Your Judgment in Dramatick Poetry
<pb facs="tcp:54446:186"/>
can ſeparate the Improvement and Morality of the Scene from the Viciouſneſs of an Expos'd Character; and you can receive the true Diverſion of a well-wrought Play; for where-ever Vertue is rewarded, your Merit is juſtly complimented.</p>
                     <p>On this Conſideration D. <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote,</hi> being in a manner a drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Piece, lays a Claim to your Protection; and thoſe who have the Honour of your Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt draw this Remark from your nice Taſte, and judicious Sentiments on that Subject and other polite Studies, That the Beauties of <hi>Cervantes</hi> are properly your own; Inſtruction without Severity, Learning without Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantry, and the Senſe of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy

in the Words of a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Motives, Sir, were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient of themſelves to make me beg your Acceptance of this Work, ſure of the Approbation of thoſe ingenious Gentlemen who have done me the Favour to joyn with me in the Tranſlation of this Volume. But I had ſtill a further Engagement to this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, my own private Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of owning to the World how much I have been obliged to your Generoſity. And I cannot forbear complimenting my ſelf upon the Countenance of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of your Merit, for whom I have ſo great a Reſpect.

                           <p>MOST fortunate and happy was the Age that uſher'd into the World that moſt daring Knight Don <hi>Quixote de la Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha!</hi> For from his generous Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to revive and reſtore the ancient Order of
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:54446:189"/>
Knight-Errantry, that was not only wholly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, but almoſt loſt and aboliſh'd, our Age bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren in it ſelf of pleaſant Recreations, derives the pleaſure we reap from his true Hiſtory, and the various Tales and Novels with which 'tis inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt, in ſome Reſpects as entertaining, as artful, and authentick. We told you, that as the Curate was preparing to give <hi>Cardenio</hi> ſome ſeaſonable Conſolation, he was prevented by a Voice whoſe doleful Complaints reach'd his Ears. O Heavens! cry'd the unſeen Mourner, is it poſſible I have at laſt found out a place that will afford a private Grave to this miſerable Body, whoſe Load I ſo repine to bear? Yes, if the ſilence and ſolitude of theſe Deſarts do not deceive me, here I may dye conceal'd from human Eyes. Ah me! Ah wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Creature! To what Extremity has Affliction driven me, reduc'd to think theſe hideous Woods and Rocks a kind Retreat! 'Tis true indeed, I may here freely complain to Heaven, and beg for that Relief which I might ask in vain of falſe Mankind; for 'tis vain, I find, to ſeek below either Counſel Eaſe, or Remedy. The Curate and his Company who heard all this diſtinctly, juſtly conjectur'd they were very near the Perſon who thus expreſs'd his Grief, and therefore roſe to find him out. They had not gone above twenty Paces, before they ſpy'd a Youth in a Country Habit ſitting at the Foot of a Rock behind an Aſh-tree; but they cou'd not well ſee his Face, being bow'd almoſt upon his Knees, as he ſat waſhing his Feet in a Rivulet that glided by. They approach'd him ſo ſoftly that he did not perceive 'em: And, as he was gently paddling in the clear Water, they had time to diſcern that his Legs were as white as Alabaſter, and ſo taper, ſo curiouſly proportion'd; and ſo fine, that nothing of the kind cou'd appear
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:54446:189"/>
more beautiful. Our obſervers were amaz'd at this Diſcovery, rightly imagining that ſuch tender Feet were not us'd to trudge in rugged ways, or meaſure the ſteps of Oxen at the Plough, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Employments of People in ſuch Apparel; and therefore the Curate who went before the reſt, whoſe Curioſity was heighten'd by this ſight, beckon'd to 'em to ſtep aſide, and hide themſelves behind ſome of the little Rocks that were by; Which they did, and from thence making a ſtricter Obſervation, they found he had on a ſhort Jerkin of coarſe ruſſet Cloth ty'd about his Waſte, with a kind of Linnen Scarf, and a pair of Breeches of the ſame, together with a Thrum cap under which his hair was turn'd up. After he had waſh'd his Feet, to dry 'em he pull'd out from under his Cap a Handkerchief that partly hid his Cheeks; and with that looking up, he diſcover'd ſo charming a Face, ſo accompliſh'd a Beauty, that <hi>Cardenio</hi> cou'd not forbear ſaying to the Curate, that ſince this was not <hi>Lucinda,</hi> 'twas certainly no human Form, but an Angel. And then the Youth taking off his Cap, and ſhaking his Head, an incredible quantity of lovely Hair flow'd down upon his Shoulders, and not only cover'd 'em, but almoſt all his Body; by which they were now convinc'd, that what they at firſt took to be a Country Lad, was a young Woman, and one of the moſt beautiful Creatures in the World. <hi>Cardenio</hi> was not leſs ſurpriz'd than the other two, and once more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd, that no Face could vie with hers but <hi>Lucin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>'s. To part her deſhevel'd Treſſes, ſhe only us'd her ſlender Fingers, and at the ſame time diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd ſo fine a pair of Arms and Hands, ſo white and lovely, that our three admiring Gazers grew more impatient to know who ſhe was, and mov'd forwards to accoſt her. At the noiſe they
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:54446:190"/>
made, the pretty Creature ſtarted; and peeping thro' her Hair which ſhe haſtily remov'd from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her Eyes with both her Hands, ſhe no ſooner ſaw three Men coming towards her, but in a mighty fright ſhe ſnatch'd up a little Bundle that lay by her, and fled as faſt as ſhe cou'd, without ſo much as ſtaying to put on her Shooes, or do up her Hair. But alas! ſcarce had ſhe gone ſix ſteps, when her tender Feet not being able to endure the rough Encounter of the Stones, the poor affrighted Fair fell on the hard Ground; ſo that thoſe from whom ſhe fled, haſt'ning to help her, Stay, Madam, cry'd the Curate, whoever you be, you have no reaſon to fly: We have no other Deſign but to do you Service. With that, approaching her, he took her by the hand, and perceiving ſhe was ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order'd with Fear and Confuſion that ſhe cou'd not anſwer a word, he ſtrove to compoſe her mind with kind Expreſſions. Be not afraid, Madam, continu'd he; tho' your Hair has betray'd what your Diſguiſe conceal'd from us, we are but the more diſpos'd to aſſiſt you, and do you all manner of Service. Then pray tell us how we may beſt do it. I imagine it was no ſlight occaſion that made you obſcure your ſingular Beauty under ſo unworthy a Diſguiſe, and venture into this Deſart, where it was the greateſt Chance in the World that e'er you met with us. However, we hope it is not impoſſible to find a Remedy for your Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, ſince there are none which reaſon and time will not at laſt ſurmount: And therefore, Madam, if you have not abſolutely renounc'd all human Comfort, I beſeech you tell us the Cauſe of your Affliction, and aſſure your ſelf we do not ask this out of meer Curioſity, but a real Deſire to ſerve you, and either to condole or aſſwage your Grief.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="331" facs="tcp:54446:190"/>While the Curate endeavour'd thus to remove the trembling fair one's Apprehenſion, ſhe ſtood amaz'd, ſtaring, without ſpeaking a Word, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times upon one, ſometimes upon another, like one ſcarce well awake, or like an ignorant Clown who happens to ſee ſome ſtrange ſight. But at laſt the Curate having given her time to recollect her ſelf, and perſiſting in his earneſt and civil In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, ſhe fetch'd a deep Sigh, and then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſing her Lips, broke ſilence in this manner. Since this Deſart has not been able to conceal me, and my Hair has betray'd me, 'twou'd be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs now for me to diſſemble with you; and ſince you deſire to hear the Story of my Misfortunes, I cannot in Civility deny you, after all the obliging Offers you have been pleas'd to make me: But yet, Gentlemen, I am much afraid, what I've to ſay will but make you ſad, and afford you little Satisfaction; for you will find my diſaſters are not to be remedy'd. There's one thing that troubles me yet more; it ſhocks my Nature to think I muſt be forc'd to reveal to you ſome Secrets which I had deſign'd to have bury'd in my Grave: But yet conſidering the Garb and the Place you've found me in, I fancy 'twill be better for me to tell you all, than to give you occaſion to doubt of my paſt Conduct and my preſent Deſigns by an affected Reſervedneſs. The diſguis'd Lady having made this Anſwer, with a modeſt Bluſh and extraordinary Diſcretion, the Curate and his Company, who now admir'd her the more for her Senſe, renew'd their kind Offers and preſſing Sollicitations; and then they modeſtly let her retire a Moment to ſome diſtance to put her ſelf in decent Order. Which done, ſhe return'd, and being all ſeated on the Graſs, after ſhe had us'd no ſmall Violence to ſmother her Tears, ſhe thus began her Story.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="332" facs="tcp:54446:191"/>I was born in a certain Town of <hi>Andaluzia,</hi> from which a Duke takes his Title, that makes him a Grandee of <hi>Spain.</hi> This Duke has two Sons, the Eldeſt Heir to his Eſtate and Virtues, the Younger Heir to nothing I know of but the Deceit and Perfidiouſneſs of the greateſt Traitors that ever liv'd. My Father, who is one of his Vaſſals, is but of low degree; but ſo very rich, that, had Fortune equall'd his Birth to his Eſtate, he cou'd have wanted nothing more, and I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps had never been ſo miſerable; for I verily believe, my not being of noble Blood is the chief occaſion of my Ruin. And yet my Parents are not ſo meanly born neither, as to have any cauſe to be aſham'd of their Original. 'Tis true, they have been Farmers from Father to Son, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mixture or ſtain of infamous or ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Blood. They are good old Chriſtians (as we call our true primitive <hi>Spaniards</hi>) and the Antiquity of their Family, together with their large Poſſeſſions, and the Port they live in, raiſes 'em much above their Profeſſion, and has by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little almoſt univerſally gain'd 'em the name of Gentlemen, ſetting 'em in a manner e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to many ſuch in the World's Eſteem. As I am their only Child, they ever lov'd me with all the tenderneſs of indulgent Parents; and their great Affection made 'em eſteem themſelves hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier in their Daughter, than in the peaceable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of their large Eſtate. Now as it was my good Fortune to be poſſeſs'd of their Love, they were pleas'd to intruſt me with their Wealth. The whole Houſe was left to my Management, and I took ſuch Care not to abuſe the Truſt they repos'd in me, that I never forfeited their good opinion of my Diſcretion. The time I had to
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:54446:191"/>
ſpare from the Care of the Family, I commonly imploy'd in the uſual Exerciſes of young Women, ſometimes making Lace, or at my Needle, and now and then reading ſome good Book, or play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Spaniſh Harp; having experienc'd that Muſick was very proper to recreate the wearied Mind: And this was the innocent Life I led. I have not deſcended to theſe Particulars out of vain Oſtentation, but meerly that when I come to relate my Misfortunes, you may obſerve I do not owe 'em to my ill Conduct. While I thus liv'd the Life of a Nun, unſeen as I thought by any body but our own Family, and never leaving the Houſe but to go to Church, which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly betimes in the Morning, and always with my Mother, and ſo cloſe hid in a Veil that I cou'd ſcarce find my way; notwithſtanding all the Care that was taken to keep me from being ſeen, 'twas unhappily rumour'd abroad that I was handſome, and to my eternal Diſquiet Love in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded into my peaceful Retirement. Don <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand,</hi> ſecond Son to the Duke I've mention'd, had a ſight of me—Scarce had <hi>Cardenio</hi> heard Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> nam'd, but he chang'd Colour, and betray'd ſuch a Diſorder of Body and Mind, that the Curate and the Barber were afraid he wou'd have fallen into one of thoſe frantick Fits that often us'd to take him. But by good Fortune it did not come to that, and he only ſet himſelf to look ſtedfaſtly on the Country Maid, preſently gueſſing who ſhe was; while ſhe continu'd her Story, without taking any notice of the alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Countenance.</p>
                           <p>No ſooner had he ſeen me, ſaid ſhe, but, as he ſince told me, he felt in his Breaſt that violent Paſſion of which he afterwards gave me ſo many Proofs. But not to tire you with a needleſs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:54446:192"/>
of every Particular, I will paſs over all the Means he us'd to inform me of his Love: He purchas'd the good Will of all our Servants with private Gifts: He made my Father a thouſand kind Offers of Service: Every Day ſeem'd a day of Rejoycing in our Neighbourhood, every Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſher'd in ſome Serenade, and the continual Muſick was even a Diſturbance in the Night. He got an infinite number of Love Letters tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmitted to me, I don't know by what means, every one full of the tendereſt Expreſſions, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, Vows, and Proteſtations. But all this aſſiduous Courtſhip was ſo far from inclining my Heart to a kind Return, that it rather mov'd my Indignation; inſomuch that I look'd upon Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> as my greateſt Enemy, and one wholly bent on my Ruin: Not but that I was well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough pleas'd with his Gallantry, and took a ſecret Delight in ſeeing my ſelf thus courted by a Perſon of his Quality. Such demonſtrations of Love are never altogether diſpleaſing to Women, and the moſt diſdainful, in ſpight of all their Coyneſs, reſerve a little Complaiſance in their Hearts for their Admirers. But the diſproportion between our Qualities was too great to ſuffer me to entertain any reaſonable Hopes, and his Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry too ſingular not to offend me. Beſides, my Father, who ſoon made a right Conſtruction of Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s Pretenſions, with his prudent Admonitions concurr'd with the Senſe I ever had of my Honour, and baniſh'd from my Mind all favourable Thoughts of his Addreſſes. However, like a kind Parent, perceiving I was ſomewhat uneaſy, and imagining the flattering Proſpect of ſo advantagious a Match might ſtill amuſe me, he told me one day he repos'd the utmoſt Truſt in my Virtue, eſteeming it the ſtrongeſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:54446:192"/>
he could oppoſe to Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Deſigns; yet if I wou'd Marry, to rid me at once of his unjuſt Purſuit, and prevent the ruin of my Reputation, I ſhou'd have Liberty to make my own choice of a ſuitable Match, either in our own Town or the Neighbourhood; and that he would do for me whatever cou'd be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from a loving Father. I humbly thank'd him for his Kindneſs, and told him, that as I had never yet had any Thoughts of Marriage, I wou'd try to rid my ſelf of Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſome other way. Accordingly I reſolv'd to ſhun him with ſo much Precaution, that he ſhou'd never have the Opportunity to ſpeak to me: But all my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'dneſs, far from tiring out his Paſſion, ſtrengthen'd it the more. In ſhort, Don <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> either hearing or ſuſpecting I was to be marry'd, thought of a contrivance to croſs a Deſign that was likely to cut off all his Hopes. One Night therefore when I was in my Chamber, no Body with me but my Maid, and the Door double-lock'd and bolted, that I might be ſecur'd againſt the Attempts of Don <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> whom I took to be a Man who would ſtick at nothing to compaſs his Deſigns, unexpectedly I ſaw him juſt before me; which amazing ſight ſo ſurpriz'd me, that I was ſtruck dumb, and fainted away with Fear. So I had not power to call for help, nor do I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he wou'd have given me time to have done it, had I attempted it; for he preſently ran to me, and taking me in his Arms, while I was ſinking with the Fright, he ſpoke to me in ſuch endearing Terms, and with ſo much Addreſs, and pretended Tenderneſs and Sincerity, that I did not dare to cry out when I came to my ſelf. His Sighs, and yet more his Tears, ſeem'd to me undeniable proofs of his vow'd Integrity; and I
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:54446:193"/>
being but young, bred up in perpetual Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from all Society but my virtuous Parents, and unexperienc'd in thoſe Affairs in which even the moſt knowing are apt to be miſtaken, my reluctancy abated by Degrees, and I began to have ſome ſenſe of Compaſſion, yet none but what was conſiſtent with my Honour. However, when I was pretty well recover'd from my firſt Fright, my former Reſolution return'd; and then, with more Courage than I thought I ſhou'd have had, My Lord, ſaid Love, I, if at the ſame time that you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me your Love, and give me ſuch ſtrange De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of it, you wou'd alſo offer me Poiſon, and Leave to take my choice, I wou'd ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve which to accept, and convince you by my Death that my Honour is dearer to me than my Life. To be plain, I can have no good opinion of a Preſumption that endangers my Reputation; and unleſs you leave me this Moment, I will ſo effectually make you know how much you're miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in me, that if you have but the leaſt ſenſe of Honour left, you'll repent the driving me to that Extremity as long as you live. I was born your Vaſſal, but not your Slave; nor does the greatneſs of your Birth privilege you to injure your Inferiours, or exact from me more than the Duties which all Vaſſals pay: That excepted, I do not eſteem my ſelf leſs in my low Degree, than you have reaſon to value your ſelf in your high Rank. Do not then think to awe or dazzle me with your Grandeur, or fright or force me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a baſe Compliance; I am not to be tempted with Titles, Pomp, and Equipage, nor weak e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be mov'd with vain Sighs, and falſe Tears. In ſhort, my Will is wholly at my Father's Diſpoſal, and I will not entertain any Man as a Lover but by his Appointment. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:54446:193"/>
my Lord, if you wou'd have me believe you ſo ſincerely love me, give over your vain and injurious Purſuit; ſuffer me peaceably to enjoy the benefits of Life in the free poſſeſſion of my Honour, the loſs of which for ever imbitters all Life's Sweets; and ſince you cannot be my Husband, do not expect from me that Affection which I cannot pay to any other. What do you mean, charming <hi>Dorothea?</hi> cry'd the perfidious Lord. Cannot I be yours by the ſacred Title of Husband? Who can hinder me, if you'll but conſent to bleſs me on thoſe Terms? Too hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py if I have no other Obſtacle to ſurmount. I am yours this Moment, beautiful <hi>Dorothea;</hi> ſee, I give you here my Hand to be yours, and yours alone for ever: And let all-ſeeing Heaven, and this Holy Image here on your Oratory, witneſs the ſolemn Truth.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Cardenio</hi> hearing her call her ſelf <hi>Dorothea,</hi> was now fully ſatisfy'd ſhe was the Perſon whom he took her to be: However he wou'd not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt her Story, being impatient to hear the End of it; only addreſſing himſelf to her, Is then your Name <hi>Dorothea,</hi> Madam? cry'd he: I have heard of a Lady of that Name whoſe Misfortunes have a great Reſemblance with yours. But pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, I beſeech you, and when you have done, I may perhaps ſurprize you with an Account of things that have ſome Affinity with thoſe you relate. With that <hi>Dorothea</hi> made a ſtop to ſtudy <hi>Cardenio</hi>'s Face, and his wretched Attire; and then earneſtly deſir'd him, if he knew any thing that concern'd her, to let her know it preſently; telling him that all the Happineſs ſhe had left, was only the Courage to bear with Reſignation all the Diſaſters that might befal her, well aſſur'd that no new one cou'd make her more unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:54446:194"/>
then ſhe was already. Truly, Madam, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd <hi>Cardenio,</hi> I wou'd tell you all I know, were I ſure my Conjectures were true; but ſo far as I may judge by what I've heard hitherto, I don't think it material to tell it you yet, and I ſhall find a more proper time to do it. Then <hi>Dorothea</hi> reſuming her Diſcourſe, Don <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> ſaid ſhe, repeated his Vows of Marriage in the moſt ſerious manner; and giving me his Hand, plighted me his Faith with the moſt binding Words, and ſacred Oaths. But before I wou'd let him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage himſelf thus, I advis'd him to have a Care how he ſuffer'd an unruly Paſſion to get the Aſcendant over his Reaſon, to the endangering of his future Happineſs. My Lord, ſaid I, let not a few tranſitory and imaginary Charms, which cou'd never excuſe ſuch an exceſs of Love, hurry you to your Ruin: Spare your noble Father the Shame and Diſpleaſure of ſeeing you marry'd to a Perſon ſo much below your Birth; and do not raſhly do a thing of which you may repent, and that may make my Life uncomfortable. I added ſeveral other Reaſons to diſſuade him from that haſty Match, but they were all unregarded. Don <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> deaf to every thing but to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, engag'd and bound himſelf like an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate Lover, who ſacrifices all things to his Paſſion, or rather like a Cheat, who does not value a Breach of Vows. When I ſaw him ſo obſtinate, I began to conſider what I had to do. I am not the firſt, thought I to my ſelf, whom Marriage has rais'd to unhop'd for Greatneſs, and whoſe Beauty alone has ſupply'd her want of Birth and Merit: Thouſands beſides Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> have marry'd meerly for Love, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the inequality of Wealth or Birth. The opportunity was fair and tempting; and as For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:54446:194"/>
is not always favourable, I thought it an imprudent thing to let it ſlip. Thought I to my ſelf, while ſhe kindly offers me a Husband who aſſures me of an inviolable Affection, why ſhould I by an unreaſonable Denial make my ſelf an Enemy of ſuch a Friend? And then there was one thing more; I apprehended it would be dangerous to drive him to Deſpair by an ill-tim'd Refuſal: Nor could I think my ſelf ſafe alone in his Hands, leſt he ſhould reſolve to ſatisfy his Paſſion by Force; which done, he might think himſelf free from performing a Promiſe which I wou'd not accept, and then I ſhou'd be left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either Honour or an Excuſe; for it wou'd be no eaſy matter to perſwade my Father, and the cenſorious World, that this Noble-man was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into my Chamber without my Conſent. All theſe Reaſons, which in a Moment offer'd themſelves in my Mind, ſhook my former Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves; and Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s Sighs, his Tears, his Vows, and the ſacred Witneſſes by which he ſwore, together with his graceful Mien, his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Accompliſhments, and the Love which I fancy'd I read in all his Actions, help'd to bring on my Ruin, as I believe they would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd with any one's Heart as free and as well guarded as was mine. Then I call'd my Maid to be Witneſs of Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s Vows and ſacred En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, which he reiterated to me, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd with new Oaths and ſolemn Promiſes; he call'd again on Heaven, and on many particular Saints, to witneſs his Sincerity, wiſhing a thouſand Curſes might fall on him, in caſe he ever violated his Word. Again he ſigh'd, again he wept, and mov'd me more and more with freſh Marks of Affection; and the treacherous Maid having left the Room, the perfidious Lord preſuming on my
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:54446:195"/>
Weakneſs, compleated his pernicious Deſign. The Day which ſucceeded that unhappy Night had not yet begun to dawn, when Don <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> impatient to be gone, made all the haſte he cou'd to leave me, and told me, tho' not with ſo great a ſhow of Affection, nor ſo warmly as before, that I might rely on his Honour and on the ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Vows and Promiſes; and as a further Pledge, he pull'd off a Ring of great Value from his Finger, and put it upon mine. In ſhort he went away, and my Maid, who, as ſhe confeſs'd it to me, had let him in privately, took care to let him out into the Street by Break of Day, while I remain'd ſo ſtrangely concern'd at the thoughts of all theſe Paſſages, that I cannot well tell whether I was ſorry or pleas'd. I was in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner quite diſtracted, and either forgot, or had not the Heart to chide my Maid for her Treachery, not knowing yet whether ſhe had done me Good or Harm. I had told Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> before he went, that ſeeing I was now his own, he might make uſe of the ſame means to come again to ſee me, till he found it convenient to do me the Honour of owning, me publickly for his Wife: But he came to me only the next Night, and from that time I never cou'd ſee him more, neither at Church nor in the Street, tho' for a whole Month together I tir'd my ſelf endeavouring to find him out; being credibly inform'd he was ſtill near us, and went a Hunting almoſt every Day. I leave you to think with what uneaſineſs I paſs'd thoſe tedious Hours, when I perceiv'd his Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and had reaſon to ſuſpect his Breach of Faith. So unexpected a Slight, which I look'd upon as the moſt ſenſible Affliction that cou'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal me, had like to have quite overwhelm'd me. Then it was that I found my Maid had betray'd
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:54446:195"/>
me; I broke out into ſevere Complaints of her Preſumption, which I had ſmother'd till that time. I exclaim'd againſt Don <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted my Sighs and Tears without aſſwaging my Sorrow. What was worſe, I found my ſelf oblig'd to ſet a guard upon my very Looks, for fear my Father and Mother ſhou'd inquire into the cauſe of my Diſcontent, and ſo occaſion my being guilty of ſhameful Lies and Evaſions to conceal my more ſhameful Diſaſter. But at laſt I perceiv'd 'twas in vain to diſſemble, and I gave a Looſe to my Reſentments; for I cou'd no longer hold when I heard that Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was marry'd in a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Town to a young Lady of rich and noble Parentage, and extremely handſom, whoſe Name is <hi>Lucinda. Cardenio</hi> hearing <hi>Lucinda</hi> nam'd, felt his former Diſorder, but by good Fortune it was not ſo violent as it us'd to be, and he only ſhrugg'd up his Shoulders, bit his Lips, knit his Brows, and a little while after let fall a ſhower of Tears, which did not hinder <hi>Dorothea</hi> from going on. This News, continu'd ſhe, inſtead of freezing up my Blood with Grief and Aſtoniſhment, fill'd me with burning Rage. Deſpair took poſſeſſion of my Soul, and in the tranſports of my Fury I was ready to run raving thro' the Streets, and publiſh Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s Diſloyalty, tho' at the expence of my Reputation. I don't know whether a remainder of Reaſon ſtop'd theſe violent Motions, but I found my ſelf mightily eas'd as ſoon as I had pitch'd upon a Deſign that preſently came into my Head. I diſcover'd the Cauſe of my Grief to a young country Fellow that ſerv'd my Father, and deſir'd him to lend me a Suit of Man's Apparel, and to go along with me to the Town where I heard Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was. The Fellow us'd the beſt Arguments he had to hinder me from ſo
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:54446:196"/>
ſtrange an Undertaking; but finding I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible in my Reſolution, he aſſur'd me he was ready to ſerve me. Thereupon I put on this Habit which you ſee, and taking with me ſome of my own Clothes, together with ſome Gold and Jewels, not knowing but I might have occaſion for 'em, I ſet out that very Night, attended with that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant and many anxious thoughts, without ſo much as acquainting my Maid with my Deſign. To tell you the truth, I did not well know my ſelf what I went about; for as there could be no remedy, Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> being actually marry'd to another, what could I hope to get by ſeeing him, unleſs it were the wretched ſatisfaction of upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with his Infidelity? In two days and a half we got to the Town; where the firſt thing I did was to inquire where <hi>Lucinda</hi>'s Father liv'd. That ſingle queſtion produc'd a great deal more than I deſir'd to hear; for the firſt Man I addreſs'd my ſelf to, ſhew'd me the Houſe, and inform'd me of all that had happen'd at <hi>Lucinda</hi>'s Marriage; which it ſeems was grown ſo publick, that it 'was the talk of the whole Town. He told me how <hi>Lucinda</hi> ſwoon'd away as ſoon as ſhe had anſwer'd the Prieſt, that ſhe was contented to be Don <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi>'s Wife; and how, after he had approach'd to open her Stays to give her more room to breath, he found a Letter under her own hand, wherein ſhe declar'd ſhe cou'd not be Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s Wife, becauſe ſhe was already contracted to a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Gentleman of the ſame Town, whoſe Name was <hi>Cardenio;</hi> and that ſhe had only conſented to that Marriage in obedience to her Father. He alſo told me, that it appear'd by the Letter, and a Dagger which was found about her, that ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to have kill'd her ſelf after the Ceremony was over; and that Don <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> inrag'd to ſee
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:54446:196"/>
himſelf thus deluded, would have kill'd her him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with that very Dagger, had he not been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by thoſe that were preſent. He added, 'twas reported, that upon this Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately left the Town; and that <hi>Lucinda</hi> did not come to her ſelf till the next Day, and then ſhe told her Parents, that ſhe was really <hi>Cardenio</hi>'s Wife, and that he and ſhe were contracted before ſhe had ſeen Don <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> I heard alſo that this <hi>Cardenio</hi> was preſent at the Wedding; and that as ſoon as he ſaw her marry'd, which was a thing he could never have believ'd, he left the Town in deſpair, leaving a Letter behind him full of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of <hi>Lucinda</hi>'s Breach of Faith, and to inform his Friends of his Reſolution to go to ſome place where they ſhould never hear of him more. This was all the Diſcourſe of the Town when I came thither, and ſoon after we heard that <hi>Lucinda</hi> alſo was miſſing, and that her Father and Mother were grieving almoſt to Diſtraction, not being able to learn what was become of her. For my part, this News reviv'd my hopes, having Reaſon to be pleas'd to find Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> unmarry'd. I flatter'd my ſelf that Heaven had perhaps prevented his ſecond Marriage to make him ſenſible of his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olating the firſt, and to touch his Conſcience, in order to his acquitting himſelf of his Duty like a Chriſtian, and a Man of Honour. So I ſtrove to beguile my Cares with an imaginary proſpect of a far diſtant Change of Fortune, amuſing my ſelf with vain hopes that I might not ſink under the load of Affliction, but prolong my Life; tho' this was only a lengthning of my Sorrows, ſince I have now but the more reaſon to wiſh to be eas'd of the trouble of living. But while I ſtaid in that Town, not knowing what I had beſt to do, ſeeing I cou'd not find Don <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> I heard a Crier
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:54446:197"/>
publickly deſcribe my Perſon, my Cloaths, and my Age, in the open Street, promiſing a conſiderable Reward to any that cou'd bring Tidings of <hi>Dorothea.</hi> I alſo heard that 'twas rumour'd I was run away from my Father's Houſe with the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant who attended me; and that Report touch'd my Soul as much as Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s Perfidiouſneſs; for thus I ſaw my Reputation wholly loſt, and that too for a Subject ſo baſe and ſo unworthy of my nobler Thoughts. Thereupon I made all the haſte I cou'd to get out of the Town with my Servant, who even then, to my thinking, began by ſome Tokens to betray his faultering in the Fidelity he had promis'd me. Dreading to be diſcover'd, we reach'd the moſt deſpart part of this Mountain that Night: But, as 'tis a common Saying, that Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes ſeldom come alone, and the end of one Diſaſter is often the beginning of a greater, I was no ſooner got to that Place, where I thought my ſelf ſafe, but the Fellow, whom I had hitherto found to be modeſt and reſpectful, now rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by his own Villany, and the Opportunity which that place offer'd, than by any thing elſe, had the impudence to talk to me of Love; and ſeeing I anſwer'd him with Anger and Contempt, he wou'd no longer loſe time in clowniſh Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but reſolv'd to uſe violence to compaſs his wicked Deſign. But juſt Heaven, with a happy preſence of Mind, aſſiſted me in that Diſtreſs; and his brutiſh Paſſion ſo blinded him, that not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving he was on the brink of a ſteep Rock, I eaſily puſh'd him down; and then without look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſee what was become of him, I ran as faſt I cou'd into the thickeſt part of the Deſart to ſecure my ſelf. The next Day I met a Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who took me to his Houſe amidſt theſe Mountains, and imploy'd me ever ſince in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:54446:197"/>
of his Shepherd. There I have continu'd ſome Months, making it my buſineſs to be as much as poſſible in the Fields, the better to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal my Sex: But notwithſtanding all my Care and Induſtry, he at laſt diſcover'd I was a Woman; which made him preſume to importune me with beaſtly Offers: So that Fortune not favouring me with the former opportunity of freeing my ſelf, I left his Houſe, and choſe to ſeek a Sanctuary among theſe Woods and Rocks, there with Sighs and Tears to beſeech Heaven to pity me, and to direct and relieve me in this forlorn Condition; or at leaſt to put an end to my miſerable Life, and bury in this Deſart the very Memory of an unhappy Creature, who more thro' ill Fortune than ill Intent, has given the idle World occaſion to be too buſy with her Fame.</p>

                           <p>THIS, Gentlemen, continu'd <hi>Dorothea,</hi> is the true Story of my tragical Adventures; and now be you Judges whether I had Reaſon to make the Complaint you overheard, and whether ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate and hopeleſs a Creature be in a Condition to admit of Comfort. I have only one Favour to beg of you; be pleas'd to direct me to ſome Place where I may paſs the reſt of my Life ſecure from the Search and Inquiry of my Parents; not but their former Affection is a ſufficient Warrant for
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:54446:198"/>
my kind Reception, could the Senſe I have of the Thoughts they muſt have of my paſt Conduct per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to return to 'em; but when I think they muſt believe me guilty, and can now have nothing but my bare Word to aſſure 'em of my Innocence, I can never reſolve to ſtand their Sight. Here <hi>Dorothea</hi> ſtopt, and the Bluſhes that overſpread her Cheeks were certain Signs of the Diſcompoſure of her Thoughts, and the unfeigned Modeſty of her Soul. Thoſe who had heard her Story were deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mov'd with Compaſſion for her hard Fate, and the Curate would not delay any longer to give her ſome charitable Comfort and Advice; but ſcarce had he begun to ſpeak, when <hi>Cardenio</hi> addreſſing himſelf to her interrupted him, How Madam, ſaid he, taking her by the Hand, are you then the beautiful <hi>Dorothea,</hi> the only Daughter of the rich <hi>Cleonardo? Dorothea</hi> was ſtrangely ſurpriz'd to hear her Father nam'd, and by one in ſo tatter'd a Garb. And pray who are you Friend, ſaid ſhe to him, that know ſo well my Father's Name? for I think I did not mention it once throughout the whole Relation of my Afflictions. I am <hi>Cardenio,</hi> reply'd the other, that unfortunate Gentleman, whom <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinda,</hi> as you told us, declar'd to be her Husband: I am that miſerable <hi>Cardenio,</hi> whom the Perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Man who has reduc'd you to this deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Condition, has alſo brought to this wretched State, to Rags, to Nakedneſs, to Deſpair, nay to Madneſs it ſelf, and all Hardſhips and Want of human Comforts; only enjoying the Privilege of Reaſon by ſhort Intervals, to feel and bemoan my Miſeries the more. I am the Man, fair <hi>Dorothea,</hi> who was the unhappy Eye-witneſs of Don <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi>'s unjuſt Nuptials, and who heard my <hi>Lucinda</hi> give her Conſent to be his Wife; that heartleſs Wretch, who unable to bear ſo ſtrange a Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:54446:198"/>
loſt in Amazement and Trouble, flung out of the Houſe, without ſtaying to know what would follow her Trance, and what the Paper that was taken out of her Boſom would produce. I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd my ſelf to Deſpair; and having left a Letter with a Perſon whom I charg'd to deliver it into <hi>Lucinda</hi>'s own Hands, I haſten'd to hide my ſelf from the World in this Deſart, reſolv'd to end there a Life which from that Moment I abhorr'd as my greateſt Enemy. But Fortune has preſerv'd me I ſee that I may venture it upon a better Cauſe; for from what you have told us now, which I have no Reaſon to doubt, I am embolden'd to hope that Providence may yet reſerve us to a better Fate than we durſt have expected; Heaven will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore you Don <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who cannot be <hi>Lucinda</hi>'s, and to me <hi>Lucinda,</hi> who cannot be Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s. For my Part, tho' my Intereſts were not link'd with yours, as they are, I have ſo deep a Senſe of your Misfortunes, that I would expoſe my ſelf to any Dangers to ſee you righted by Don <hi>Ferdinand:</hi> And here, on the Word of a Gentleman and a Chriſtian, I vow and promiſe not to forſake you till he has done you Juſtice, and to oblige him to do it at the Hazard of my Life, ſhou'd Reaſon and Generoſity prove ineffectual to force him to be bleſt with you. <hi>Dorothea</hi> raviſh'd with Joy, and not knowing how to expreſs a due Senſe of <hi>Carde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio</hi>'s obliging Offers, would have thrown her ſelf at his Feet had he not civilly hinder'd it. At the ſame Time the Curate diſcreetly ſpeaking for 'em both, highly applauded <hi>Cardenio</hi> for his generous Reſolution, and comforted <hi>Dorothea:</hi> He alſo very heartily invited 'em to his Houſe, where they might furniſh themſelves with Neceſſaries, and conſult together how to find out Don <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and bring <hi>Dorothea</hi> home to her Father; which
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:54446:199"/>
kind Offer they thankfully accepted. Then the Barber, who had been ſilent all this while, put in for a Share, and handſomly aſſur'd them he would be very ready to do 'em all the Service that might lie in his Power. After theſe Civilities he acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 'em with the Deſign that had brought the Curate and him to that Place; and gave 'em an Account of Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s ſtrange kind of Madneſs, and of their ſtaying there for his Squire. <hi>Cardenio</hi> hearing him mention'd, remember'd ſomething of the Scuffle he had with them both, but only as if it had been a Dream; ſo that tho' he told the Company of it, he could not let them know the Occaſion. By this Time they heard ſome Body call, and by the Voice they knew it was <hi>Sancho Pança,</hi> who not finding 'em where he had left 'em, tore his very Lungs with hollowing. With that they all went to meet him; which done, they ask'd him what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of Don <hi>Quixote?</hi> Alaſs, anſwer'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> I left him yonder in an ill Plight: I found him in his Shirt, lean, pale, and almoſt ſtarv'd, ſighing and whining for his Lady <hi>Dulcinea:</hi> I told him how that ſhe'd have him come to her preſently to <hi>Toboſo,</hi> where ſhe look'd for him out of Hand; yet for all this he would not budge a Foot, but e'en told me he was reſolv'd he wou'd ne'er ſet Eyes on her ſweet Face again till he had done ſome Feats that might make him worthy of her Goodneſs: So that, added <hi>Sancho,</hi> if he leads this Life any longer, I fear me my poor Maſter is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver like to be an Emperor, as he is bound in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be, nay not ſo much as an Archbiſhop, which is the leaſt thing he can come off with; therefore, good Sir, ſee and get him away by all Means I beſeech you. The Curate bid him be of good Cheer, for they would take Care to make him leave that Place whether he wou'd or not;
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:54446:199"/>
and then turning to <hi>Cardenio</hi> and <hi>Dorothea,</hi> he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd 'em of the Deſign which he and the Barber had laid in order to his Cure, or at leaſt to get him home to his Houſe. <hi>Dorothea,</hi> whoſe Mind was much eas'd with the Proſpect of better Fortune, kindly undertook to act the diſtreſs'd Lady her ſelf, which ſhe ſaid ſhe thought wou'd become her better than the Barber, having a Dreſs very proper for that Purpoſe, beſides ſhe had read many Books of Chivalry, and knew how the diſtreſs'd Ladies us'd to expreſs themſelves when they came to beg ſome Knight-Errant's Aſſiſtance. This is obliging, Madam, ſaid the Curate, and we want nothing more: So let's to work as faſt as we can; we may now hope to ſucceed ſince you thus happily facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Deſign. Preſently <hi>Dorothea</hi> took out of her Bundle a Petticoat of very rich Stuff, and a Gown of very fine green Silk, alſo a Necklace, and ſeveral other Jewels out of a Box; and with theſe in an Inſtant ſhe ſo ado<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>
                              </gap>d her ſelf, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd ſo beautiful and glorious, that they all ſtood in Admiration that Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſhould be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicious to ſlight ſo accompliſh'd a Beauty. But he that admir'd her moſt was <hi>Sancho Pança;</hi> for he thought he had ne'er ſet Eyes on ſo fine a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and perhaps he thought right: Which made him earneſtly ask the Curate who that fine Dame was, and what Wind had blown her thither among the Woods and Rocks? Who that fine Lady <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho?</hi> anſwer'd the Curate; ſhe's the only Heireſs in a direct Line to the vaſt Kingdom of <hi>Micomicon:</hi> Mov'd by the Fame of your Maſter's great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits, that ſpreads it ſelf over all <hi>Guinea,</hi> ſhe comes to ſeek him out, and beg a Boon of him; that is, to redreſs a Wrong which a wicked Giant has done her. Why that's well, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> a happy Seeking and a happy Finding. Now if my
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:54446:200"/>
Maſter be but ſo lucky as to right that Wrong, by killing that Son of a Whore of a Giant you tell me of, I'm a made Man: Yes he will kill him, that he will, if he can but come at him, and he ben't a Hobgoblin; for my Maſter can do no Good with Hobgoblins. But Mr. Curate, an't pleaſe you, I have a Favour to ask of you: I beſeech you put my Maſter out of Conceit with all Archbiſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricks, for that's what I dread; and therefore to rid me of my Fears, put it into his Head to clap up a Match with this ſame Princeſs; for by that Means 'twill be paſt his Power to make himſelf Archbiſhop, and he'll come to be Emperor and I a great Man as ſure as a Gun. I have thought well of the Matter, and I find 'tis not at all ſitting he ſhou'd be an Archbiſhop for my Good; for what ſhould I get by it? I an't fit for Church Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, I am a marry'd Man; and now for me to go to trouble my Head with getting a Licenſe to hold Church-Livings, 'twould be an endleſs Piece of Buſineſs: Therefore 'twill be better for him to marry out of hand this ſame Princeſs, whoſe Name I can't tell, for I never heard it. They call her the Princeſs <hi>Micomicona,</hi> ſaid the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; for her Kingdom being call'd <hi>Micomicon,</hi> 'tis a clear Caſe ſhe muſt be call'd ſo. Like enough, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> for I have known ſeveral Men in my Time go by the Names of the Places where they were born, as <hi>Pedro de Alcala, Juan de Ubeda, Diego de Valladolid;</hi> and mayhap the like is done in <hi>Guinea,</hi> and the Queens go by the Name of their Kingdoms. 'Tis well obſerv'd, reply'd the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate: As for the Match, I'll promote it to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of my Power. <hi>Sancho</hi> was heartily pleas'd with this Promiſe; and on the other Side, the Curate was amaz'd to find the poor Fellow ſo ſtrangely infected with his Maſter's mad Notions,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:54446:200"/>
as to rely on his becoming an Emperor. By this Time <hi>Dorothea</hi> being mounted on the Curate's Mule, and the Barber having clapt on his Ox-tail Beard, nothing remain'd but to order <hi>Sancho</hi> to ſhew 'em the Way, and to renew their Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to him, leſt he ſhou'd ſeem to know 'em, and ſo ſpoil the Plot, which if he did, they told him 'twould be the Ruin of all his Hopes and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's Empire. As for <hi>Cardenio,</hi> he did not think fit to go with 'em, having no Buſineſs there; beſides, he cou'd not tell but that Don <hi>Quixote</hi> might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member their late Fray. The Curate likewiſe, not thinking his Preſence neceſſary, reſolv'd to ſtay to keep <hi>Cardenio</hi> Company; ſo after he had once more given <hi>Dorothea</hi> her Cue, ſhe and the Barber went before with <hi>Sancho,</hi> while the two others follow'd on foot at a Diſtance.</p>
                           <p>Thus they went on for about three Quarters of a League, and then among the Rocks they ſpy'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> who had by this Time put on his Cloaths tho' not his Armour. Immediately <hi>Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea</hi> underſtanding he was the Perſon, whipp'd her Palfry, and when ſhe drew near Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> her Squire alighted and took her from her Saddle. When ſhe was upon her Feet ſhe gracefully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd towards the Knight, and with her Squire falling on her Knees before him, in ſpight of his Endeavours to the contrary, Thrice valorous and invincible Knight, ſaid ſhe, never will I riſe from this Place till your Generoſity has granted me a Boon, which ſhall redound to your Honour, and the Relief of the moſt diſconſolate and moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd Damſel that the Sun ever ſaw: And indeed if your Valour and the Strength of your formidable Arm be anſwerable to the Extent of your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Renown, you are bound by the Laws of Honour and the Knighthood which you profeſs, to
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:54446:201"/>
ſuccour a diſtreſs'd Princeſs, who led by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſounding Fame of your marvellous and redoubted Feats of Arms, comes from the remoteſt Regions to implore your Protection. I cannot, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> make you any Anſwer, moſt beautiful La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, nor will I hear a Word more unleſs you vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to riſe. Pardon me, noble Knight, reply'd the petitioning Damſel; my Knees ſhall firſt be rooted here, unleſs you will courteouſly condeſcend to grant me the Boon which I humbly requeſt. I grant it then, Lady, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> provided it be nothing to the Diſſervice of my King, my Country, and that Beauty who keeps the Key of my Heart and Liberty. It ſhall not tend to the Prejudice or Detriment of any of theſe, cry'd the Lady. With that <hi>Sancho</hi> cloſing up to his Maſter, and whiſpering him in the Ear, Grant it Sir, quoth he, grant it I tell ye; 'tis but a Trifle next to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, only to kill a great Looby of a Giant; and ſhe that asks this is the high and mighty Princeſs <hi>Micomicona,</hi> Queen of the huge Kingdom of <hi>Mico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micon</hi> in <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> Let her be what ſhe will, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> I will diſcharge my Duty and obey the Dictates of my Conſcience according to the Rules of my Profeſſion. With that turning to the Damſel, Riſe Lady, I beſeech you, cry'd he; I grant you the Boon which your ſingular Beauty demands. Sir, ſaid the Lady, the Boon I have to beg of your magnanimous Valour is, that you will be pleas'd to go with me inſtantly whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſhall conduct you, and promiſe me not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in any other Adventure till you have reveng'd me on a Traytor who uſurps my Kingdom, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Laws both Human and Divine. I grant you all this, Lady, quoth Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> and therefore from this Moment ſhake off all deſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Thoughts that ſit heavy upon your Mind,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:54446:201"/>
and ſtudy to revive your drooping Hopes; for by the Aſſiſtance of Heaven and my ſtrenuous Arm, you ſhall ſee your ſelf reſtor'd to your Kingdom, and ſeated on the Throne of your Anceſtors, in ſpight of all the Traitors that dare oppoſe your Right. Let us then haſten our Performance; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay always breeds Danger; and to protract a great Deſign is often to ruin it. The thankful Princeſs, to ſpeak her grateful Senſe of his Generoſity, ſtrove to kiſs the Knight's Hand; however he who was in every thing the moſt gallant and courteous of all Knights, would by no Means admit of ſuch a Submiſſion; but having gently rais'd her up, he embrac'd her with an awful Grace and Civility, and then call'd to <hi>Sancho</hi> for his Arms. <hi>Sancho</hi> went immediately, and having fetch'd 'em from a Tree, where they hung like Trophies, arm'd his Maſter in a Moment And now the Champion being compleatly accoutred, Come on, ſaid he, let us go and vindicate the Rights of this diſpoſſeſs'd Princeſs. The Barber was all this while upon his Knees, and had enough to do to keep himſelf from laughing, and his Beard from falling, which, if it had drop'd off, as it threaten'd, wou'd have betrayed his Face and their whole Plot at once. But being reliev'd by Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s haſte to put on his Armour, he roſe up, and taking the Princeſs by the Hand, they both together ſet her upon her Mule. Then the Knight mounted his <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and the Barber got on his Beaſt. Only poor <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> was forc'd to foot it, which made him fetch many a heavy Sigh, for the loſs of his dear Dap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: However, he bore his Croſſes patiently, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Maſter in ſo fair a way of being next door to an Emperor; for he did not queſtion but he wou'd marry that Princeſs, and ſo be at leaſt King of <hi>Micomicon.</hi> But yet it griev'd him
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:54446:202"/>
to think his Maſter's Dominions were to be in the Land of the Negroes, and that conſequently the People over whom he was to be Governour were all to be black. But he preſently bethought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of a good Remedy for that: What care I, quoth he, tho' they be Blacks? Beſt of all; 'tis but loading a Ship with them and having 'em into <hi>Spain,</hi> where I ſhall find Chapmen enow to take 'em off my Hands, and pay me ready Money for 'em; and ſo I'll raiſe a good round Sum, and buy me a Title or an Office to live upon frank and eaſy all the Days of my Life. Hang him that has no Shifts, ſay I; it's a ſorry Gooſe that will not baſte her ſelf. Why what if I am not ſo Book-learn'd as other Folks, ſure I've a Head-piece good enough to know how to ſell ten, twenty, or thirty thouſand Slaves. 'Tis as eaſy as jumping over a Straw. Let 'em e'en go higgle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy-piggledy, little and great. What tho' they be as black as the Devil in Hell, let me alone to turn 'em into white and yellow Boys: I think I know how to lick my own Fingers. Big with theſe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations, <hi>Sancho</hi> trudg'd along ſo pleas'd and light-hearted that he forgot his Pain of travelling afoot. <hi>Cardenio</hi> and the Curate had beheld the pleaſant Scene thro' the Buſhes, and were at a Loſs what they ſhould do to join Companies: But the Curate, who had a contriving Head, at laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought himſelf of an Expedient; and pulling out a Pair of Sciſſars which he us'd to carry in his Pocket, he ſnipp'd off <hi>Cardenio</hi>'s Beard in a Trice; and having pull'd off his black Cloak and a ſad-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd Riding hood which he had on, he equipp'd <hi>Cardenio</hi> with 'em, while he himſelf remain'd in his Doublet and Breeches. In which new Garb <hi>Cardenio</hi> was ſo ſtrangely alter'd, that he wou'd not have known himſelf in a Looking-glaſs. This
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:54446:202"/>
done they made to the High-way, and there ſtay'd till Don <hi>Quixote</hi> and his Company were got clear of the Rocks and bad Ways, which did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Horſemen to go ſo faſt as thoſe on foot. When they came near, the Curate look'd very earneſtly upon Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> as one that was in a Study whether he might not know him; and then, like one that had made a Diſcovery, he ran towards the Knight with open Arms, crying out, Mirrour of Chivalry, my noble Countryman Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha!</hi> the Cream and Flower of Gentility! the Shelter and Relief of the Afflicted, and Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence of Knight-Errantry! How over-joy'd am I to have found you! At the ſame Time he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd his left Leg. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> admiring what Adorer of his heroick Worth this ſhould be, look'd on him earneſtly; and at laſt calling him to Mind, wou'd have alighted to have pay'd him his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, not a little amaz'd to meet him there. But the Curate hindring him, Reverend Sir, cry'd the Knight, I beſeech you let me not be ſo rude as to ſit on Horſe-back, while a Perſon of your Worth and Character is on foot. Sir, reply'd the Curate, you ſhall by no Means alight: Let your Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy be pleas'd to keep your Saddle, ſince thus mounted you every Day atchieve the moſt ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous Feats of Arms and Adventures that were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen in our Age. 'Twill be Honour enough for an unworthy Prieſt, like me, to get up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind ſome of your Company, if they will permit me; and I will eſteem it as great a Happineſs, as to be mounted upon <hi>Pegaſus,</hi> or the <hi>Zebra</hi> or Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant of the famous Moor <hi>Muſaraque,</hi> who to this Hour lies inchanted in the dreary Cavern of <hi>Zule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> not far diſtant from the great <hi>Compluto.</hi> Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:54446:203"/>
good Sir, I did not think of this, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> but I ſuppoſe my Lady the Princeſs will be ſo kind as to command her Squire to lend you his Saddle, and to ride behind himſelf, if his Mule be but us'd to carry double. I believe it will, cry'd the Princeſs; and my Squire, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, will not ſtay for my Commands to offer his Saddle, for he is too courteous and well-bred to ſuffer an Eccleſiaſtical Perſon to go afoot, when we may help him to a Mule. Moſt certainly, cry'd the Barber; and with that diſmounting, he offer'd the Curate his Saddle, which was accepted without much Intreaty. By ill Fortune the Mule was a hir'd Beaſt, and conſequently unlucky; ſo as the Barber was getting up behind the Curate; the reſty Jade gave two or three Jerks with her hinder Legs, that had they met with Maſter <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi>'s Scull or Ribs, he wou'd have bequeath'd his Rambling after Don <hi>Quixote</hi> to the Devil. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he flung himſelf nimbly off, and was more afraid than hurt; but yet as he fell his Beard dropp'd off, and being preſently ſenſible of that Accident, he cou'd not think of any better Shift than to clap both his Hands before his Cheeks, and cry out he had broken his Jaw-bone. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was amaz'd to ſee ſuch an overgrown Buſh of Beard lie on the Ground without Jaws and blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. Bleſs me, cry'd he, what an amazing Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle is this! Here's a Beard as cleverly taken off by Accident, as if a Barber had mow'd it. The Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate perceiving the Danger they were in of being diſcover'd, haſtily caught up the Beard, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Barber, who lay all the while roaring and complaining, he pull'd his Head cloſe to his own Breaſt, and then muttering certain Words, which he ſaid were a Charm appropriated to the faſt'ning on of fall'n Beards, he fix'd it on again
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:54446:203"/>
ſo handſomely, that the Squire was preſently as bearded and as well as ever he was before; which rais'd Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Admiration, and made him engage the Curate to teach him the Charm at his Leiſure, not doubting but its Virtue extended further than to the faſt'ning on of Beards, ſince 'twas impoſſible that ſuch a one cou'd be torn off without fetching away Fleſh and all; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſuch a ſudden Cure might be beneficial to him upon Occaſion. And now every thing being ſet to rights, they agreed that the Curate ſhou'd ride firſt by himſelf, and then the other two by Turns relieving one another, ſometimes riding ſometimes walking, till they came to their Inn, which was about two Leagues off. So Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote,</hi> the Princeſs, and the Curate being mounted, and <hi>Cardenio,</hi> the Barber, and <hi>Sancho</hi> ready to move forwards on foot, the Knight addreſſing himſelf to the diſtreſs'd Damſel, Now Lady, ſaid he, let me intreat your Greatneſs to tell me which Way we muſt go to do you Service. The Curate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe cou'd anſwer, thought fit to ask her a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion that might the better enable her to make a proper Reply. Pray Madam, ſaid he, towards what Country is it your Pleaſure to take your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs? Is it not towards the Kingdom of <hi>Micomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con?</hi> I am very much miſtaken if that be not the Part of the World whither you deſire to go. The Lady having her Cue, preſently underſtood the Curate, and anſwer'd that he was in the Right. Then, ſaid the Curate, your Way lies directly through the Village where I live, from whence we have a ſtrait Road to <hi>Carthagena,</hi> where you may conveniently take Shipping; and if you have a fair Wind and good Weather, you may in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than nine Years reach the vaſt Lake <hi>Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

more than a hundred Days Journey from your Kingdom. Surely, Sir, reply'd the Lady, you are under a Miſtake; for 'tis not quite two Years ſince I left the Place, and beſides we have had very little fair Weather all the while, and yet I am already got hither, and have ſo far ſucceeded in my Deſigns, as to have obtain'd the Sight of the renown'd Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> the Fame of whoſe Atchievements reach'd my Ears as ſoon as I landed in <hi>Spain,</hi> and mov'd me to find him out to throw my ſelf under his Protection, and commit the Juſtice of my Cauſe to his invincible Valour. No more Madam, I beſeech you, cry'd Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> ſpare me the Trouble of hearing my ſelf prais'd, for I mortally hate whatever may look like Adulation; and tho' your Compliments may deſerve a better Name, my Ears are too mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt to be pleas'd with any ſuch Diſcourſe; 'tis my Study to deſerve and to avoid Applauſe. All I will venture to ſay, is, that whether I have any Valour or no, I am wholly at your Service, even at the Expence of the laſt Drop of my Blood; and therefore waving all theſe Matters till a fit Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, I would gladly know of this reverend Clergyman what brought him hither, unattended by any of his Servants, alone, and ſo ſlenderly cloth'd, for I muſt confeſs I am not a little ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd to meet him in this Condition.

<pb n="359" facs="tcp:54446:204"/>
we met four Highwaymen that rob'd us of all we had, even to our very Beards, ſo that the poor Barber was forc'd to get him a Chin-Perriwig. And for that young Gentleman whom you ſee there (continu'd he, pointing to <hi>Cardenio</hi>) after they had ſtripp'd him to his Shirt, they transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur'd him as you ſee. Now every Body hereabouts ſays, that thoſe who rob'd us were certainly a Pack of Rogues condemn'd to the Gallies, who, as they were going to Puniſhment, were reſcu'd by a ſingle Man not far from this Place, and that with ſo much Courage, that in ſpite of the King's Officer and his Guards he alone ſet 'em all at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. Certainly that Man was either mad, or as great a Rogue as any of 'em; for wou'd any one that had a Grain of Senſe or Honeſty have let looſe a Company of Wolves among Sheep, Foxes among innocent Poultry, and Waſps among the Honey-pots? He has hinder'd publick Juſtice from taking its Courſe, broke his Allegiance to his lawful Soveraign, diſabl'd the Strength of his Gallies, rebell'd againſt him, and oppos'd his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in Contempt of the Law, and ſet in an Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar the holy Brotherhood, thoſe honeſt Thief-catchers, that had lain quiet ſo long; nay, what is yet worſe, he has endanger'd his Life upon Earth and his Salvation hereafter. <hi>Sancho</hi> had given the Curate an Account of the Adventure of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Slaves, and this made him inveigh againſt it ſo ſeverely, to try how Don <hi>Quixote</hi> wou'd bear i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

You buffleheaded Clown, cry'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> Is it for a Knight-Errant when he meets with People laden with Chains, and under Oppreſſion, to examine whether they are in thoſe Circumſtances for their Crimes, or only thro' Misfortune? We are only to relieve the Afflicted, to look on their Diſtreſs, and not on their Crimes.

This ſaid with a grim Look, he fix'd himſelf in his Stirrups, and pull'd his Helmet o'er his Brows; for the Baſon, which he took to be <hi>Mambrino</hi>'s Helmet, hung at his Saddle-bow, in order to have the Damage repair'd which it had receiv'd from the Gally-Slaves. Thereupon <hi>Dorothea,</hi> by this time well acquainted with his Temper, ſeeing him in ſuch a Paſſion, and that every Body except <hi>Sancho Pança</hi> made a Jeſt of him, reſolv'd with her Native Sprightlineſs and Addreſs to carry on the Humour. I beſeech you, Sir, cry'd ſhe, remember the Promiſe you have made me, and that you cannot engage in any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture whatſoever till you have perform'd that we are going about. Therefore pray aſſwage your Anger; for had Maſter Curate known the Gally-Slaves were reſcu'd by your invincible Arm, I'm ſure he wou'd rather have ſtitch'd up his Lips, or bit off his Tongue, than have ſpoken a word that ſhou'd make him incur your Diſpleaſure. Ney, I aſſure you, cry'd the Curate, I wou'd ſooner have twitch'd off one of my Muſtachoes into the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.

Only in recompenſe of my good Intentions, I beg you will give us the Story of your Misfortunes, if this will not be too great a Trouble to you; and let me know who and what, and how many are the Perſons of whom I muſt have due and full Satisfaction on your behalf. I am very willing to do it, reply'd <hi>Dorothea,</hi> but yet I fear a Story like mine, conſiſting wholly of Afflictions and Diſaſters, will prove but a tedious Entertainment.

With that <hi>Cardenio</hi> and the Barber gather'd up to her, to hear what kind of Story ſhe had provided ſo ſoon: <hi>Sancho</hi> alſo hung his Ears upon her Side-Saddle, being no leſs deceiv'd in her than his Maſter; and the Lady having ſeated herſelf well on her Mule, after a hem or two, and other Preparations, very gracefully began her Story.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, Gentlemen, ſaid ſhe, You muſt know my Name is—here ſhe ſtopp'd, and cou'd not call to mind the Name the Curate had given her; whereupon finding her at a nonpluſs, he made haſte to help her out. 'Tis not at all ſtrange, ſaid he, Madam, that you ſhou'd be ſo diſcompos'd by your Diſaſters, as to ſtumble at the very beginning of the Account you are going to give of 'em; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Affliction often diſtracts the Mind to that degree, and ſo deprives us of Memory, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we for a while can ſcarce think on our very Names: No wonder then, that the Princeſs <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comicona,</hi> Lawful Heireſs to the vaſt Kingdom of <hi>Micomicon,</hi> diſorder'd with ſo many Misfortunes, and perplex'd with ſo many various Thoughts for the recovery of her Crown, ſhou'd have her Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Memory ſo incumber'd; but I hope you will now recollect your ſelf, and be able to proceed. I hope ſo too, ſaid the Lady, and I will try to go thro' with my Story without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Heſitation. Know then, Gentlemen, that the King my Father, who was call'd <hi>Tinacrio</hi> the Sage, having great Skill in the Magick Art, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by his profound knowledge in that Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that Queen <hi>Xaramilla</hi> my Mother ſhou'd dye before him, that he himſelf ſhou'd not ſurvive her long, and I ſhou'd be left an Orphan. But he often ſaid, that this did not ſo much trouble him, as the foreſight he had by his Speculations, of my
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:54446:206"/>
being threaten'd with great Misfortunes, which wou'd be occaſion'd by a certain Giant, Lord of a great Iſland near the Confines of my Kingdom; his Name <hi>Pandafilando,</hi> ſirnam'd <hi>of the gloomy Sight;</hi> becauſe tho' his Eye-balls are ſeated in their due place, yet he affects to ſquint and look askew on purpoſe to fright thoſe on whom he ſtares. My Father, I ſay, knew that this Giant hearing of his Death wou'd one Day invade my Kingdom with a powerful Army, and drive me out of my Territories, without leaving me ſo much as the leaſt Village for a Retreat; tho' he knew withal that I might avoid that Extremity, if I wou'd but conſent to marry him; but, as he found out by his Art, he had reaſon to think I never wou'd incline to ſuch a Match. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I never had any thoughts of marrying this Giant, nor really any other Giant in the World, how unmeaſurably Great and Mighty ſoever he were. My Father therefore charg'd me patiently to bear my Misfortunes, and abandon my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to <hi>Pandafilando</hi> for a time, without offering to keep him out by force of Arms, ſince this wou'd be the beſt means to prevent my own Death, and the ruin of my Subjects; conſidering the impoſſibility of withſtanding the deviliſh Force of the Giant. But withal he order'd me to direct my Courſe towards <hi>Spain,</hi> where I ſhou'd be ſure to meet with a powerful Champion, in the Perſon of a Knight-Errant, whoſe Fame ſhou'd at that time be ſpread over all the Kingdom; and his Name, my Father ſaid, ſhou'd be, if I forget not, Don <hi>Azote,</hi> or Don <hi>Gigote.</hi> An't pleaſe you, forſooth, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> you wou'd ſay Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> otherwiſe call'd the Knight of the <hi>woful Figure.</hi> You are right, anſwer'd <hi>Dorothea,</hi> and my Father alſo deſcrib'd him, and ſaid, he ſhou'd be a tall
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:54446:207"/>
thin fac'd Man, and that on his right Side, under the left Shoulder, or ſomewhere thereabouts, he ſhou'd have a tawny Mole overgrown with a tuft of Hair not much unlike that of a Horſe's Main. With that Don <hi>Quixote</hi> calling for his Squire to come to him, here, ſaid he, <hi>Sancho,</hi> help me off with my Cloaths, for I'm reſolv'd to ſee whether I be the Knight of whom the Negroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick King has propheſy'd. Pray, Sir, why wou'd you pull off your Cloaths, cry'd <hi>Dorothea?</hi> To ſee whether I have ſuch a Mole about me as your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mention'd, reply'd the Knight. Your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip need not ſtrip to know that, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> for to my knowledge yo've juſt ſuch a mark as my Lady ſays, on the ſmall of your Back, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokens you to be a ſtrong body'd Man. That's e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, ſaid <hi>Dorothea;</hi> Friends may believe one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother without ſuch a ſtrict Examination; and whether it be on the Shoulder or on the Backbone, 'tis not very material. In ſhort, I find my Father aim'd right in all his Predictions, and ſo do I in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending my ſelf to Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> whoſe Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Appearance ſo well agree with my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Deſcription, and whoſe Renown is ſo far ſpread, not only in <hi>Spain,</hi> but over all <hi>La Mancha,</hi> that I had no ſooner landed at <hi>Oſſuna,</hi> but the Fame of his Proweſs reach'd my Ears; ſo that I was ſatisfy'd in my ſelf he was the Perſon in queſt of whom I came. But pray, Madam, cry'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> how did you do to land at <hi>Oſſuna,</hi> ſince 'tis no Sea-port-Town? Doubtleſs, Sir, (ſaid the Curate, before <hi>Dorothea</hi> cou'd anſwer for her ſelf,) the Princeſs wou'd ſay, that after ſhe landed at <hi>Malaga,</hi> the firſt place where ſhe heard of your feats of Arms, was <hi>Oſſuna.</hi> That's what I wou'd have ſaid, reply'd <hi>Dorothea.</hi> 'Tis eaſily underſtood, ſaid the Curate; then pray let your Majeſty be
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:54446:207"/>
pleas'd to go on with your Story. I've nothing more to add, anſwer'd <hi>Dorothea,</hi> but that Fortune has at laſt ſo far favour'd me as to make me find the noble Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> by whoſe Valour I look upon my ſelf as already reſtor'd to the Throne of my Anceſtors; ſince he has ſo courteouſly, and magnanimouſly vouchſaf'd to grant me the Boon I begg'd, to go with me whereſoever I ſhall guide him. For all I have to do is, to ſhew him this <hi>Pandafilando</hi> of the gloomy Sight, that he may ſlay him, and reſtore that to me of which he has ſo unjuſtly depriv'd me. For all this will certainly be done with the greateſt eaſe in the World, ſince 'twas foretold by <hi>Tinacrio</hi> the Sage, my good and Royal Father, who has alſo left a Prediction writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten either in <hi>Chaldaean</hi> or Greek Characters (for I cannot read 'em) which denotes, That after the Knight of the Propheſy has cut off the Giant's Head, and reſtor'd me to the Poſſeſſion of my Kingdom, if he ſhou'd ask me to marry him, I ſhou'd by no means refuſe him, but inſtantly put him in poſſeſſion of my Perſon and Kingdom. Well, Friend <hi>Sancho</hi> (ſaid Don <hi>Quixote</hi> hearing this, and turning to the Squire,) what think'ſt thou now? Doſt thou not hear how matters go? Did not I tell thee as much before? See now, whether we have not a Kingdom which we may command, and a Queen whom we may eſpouſe. Ay marry have you, reply'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> and a pox take the Son of a Whore, ſay I, that will not wed and bed her Majeſty's Grace as ſoon as Maſter <hi>Pandafilando</hi>'s Windpipes are ſlit. Look what a dainty bit ſhe is! ha! wou'd I never had a worſe Flea in my Bed! With that to ſhew his Joy, he gave two or three frisks in the Air; and turning to <hi>Dorothea,</hi> lay'd hold on her Mule by the Bridle, and flinging himſelf down on his
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:54446:208"/>
Knees, begg'd ſhe wou'd be graciouſly pleas'd to let him kiſs her Hand in token of his owning her for his Soveraign Lady. There was none of the beholders, but was ready to burſt for Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, having a ſight of the Maſter's Madneſs, and the Servant's Simplicity. In ſhort, <hi>Dorothea</hi> was oblig'd to comply with his Entreaties, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to make him a Grandee when Fortune ſhould favour her with the recovery of her loſt Kingdom. Whereupon <hi>Sancho</hi> gave her his thanks, in ſuch a manner as oblig'd the Company to a freſh Laughter. Then going on with her Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Gentlemen, ſaid ſhe, this is my Hiſtory; and among all my Misfortunes, this only has eſcap'd a recital, That not one of the numerous Attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants I brought from my Kingdom has ſurviv'd the Ruins of my Fortune, but this good Squire with the long Beard: The reſt ended their Days in a great Storm which daſh'd our Ship to pieces in the very ſight of the Harbour; and he and I had been ſharers in their Deſtiny, had we not laid hold of two Planks, by whoſe Aſſiſtance we were driven to Land, in a manner altogether miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and agreeable to the whole Series of my Life, which ſeems indeed but one continu'd Miracle. And if in any part of my Relation I have been tedious, and not ſo exact as I ſhou'd have been, you muſt impute it to what Maſter Curate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to you, in the beginning of my Story, that continual Troubles oppreſs the Senſes, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the Memory. Thoſe Pains and Afflictions, be they ever ſo intenſe and difficult, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> ſhall never deter me (moſt virtuous and highborn Lady) from adventuring for your Service, and enduring whatever I ſhall ſuffer in it: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I again ratify the aſſurances I've given you, and ſwear that I will bear you Company, tho' to
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:54446:208"/>
the end of the World, in ſearch of this implacable Enemy of yours, till I ſhall find him; whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting Head, by the help of Heaven, and my own invincible Arm, I am reſolv'd to cut off with the Edge of this (I will not ſay good) Sword; a curſe on <hi>Gines de Paſſamonte,</hi> who took away my own! This he ſpoke murmuring to himſelf, and then proſecuted his Diſcourſe in this manner: And after I have divided it from the Body, and left you quietly poſſeſs'd of your Throne, it ſhall be left at your own choice to diſpoſe of your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as you ſhall think convenient: For as long as I ſhall have my Memory full of her Image, my Will captivated, and my Underſtanding wholly ſubjected to Her, whom I now forbear to name, 'tis impoſſible I ſhould in the leaſt deviate from the Affection I bear to her, or be induc'd to think of marrying another, tho' ſhe were a Phoenix in her kind.</p>
                           <p>The Cloſe of Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Speech, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to his not marrying, touch'd <hi>Sancho</hi> ſo to the quick, that he cou'd not forbear bawling out his Reſentments: Body o' me, Sir Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> cry'd he, you are certainly out of your Wits, or how is it poſſible you ſhould ſtick at ſtriking a bargain with ſo great a Lady as this is? D' you think, Sir, Fortune will put ſuch dainty Bits in your way at every corner? Is my Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi> handſomer, d' you think? No marry is ſhe not half ſo handſome: I cou'd almoſt ſay ſhe's not worthy to tye this Woman's Shooes. I am likely indeed to get the Earldom I have fed my ſelf with hopes of, if you ſpend your time in fiſhing for Muſhrooms in the bottom of the Sea. Marry, marry out of hand, or <hi>Old Nick</hi> take you for me: Lay hold of the Kingdom which is ready to leap into your hands; and as ſoon as you are
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:54446:209"/>
a King e'en make me a Marqueſs, or a Peer of the Land; and afterwards let things go at ſixes and ſevens, 'twill be all a Caſe to <hi>Sancho.</hi> Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> quite diveſted of all Patience at the Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies which were ſpoken againſt his Lady <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinea,</hi> cou'd bear with him no longer; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, without ſo much as a word to give him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his Diſpleaſure, gave him two ſuch Blows with his Lance, that poor <hi>Sancho</hi> meaſur'd his length on the Ground, and had certainly there breath'd his laſt, had not the Knight deſiſted through the Perſwaſions of <hi>Dorothea.</hi> Think'ſt thou (ſaid he after a conſiderable Pauſe) moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Peaſant, that I ſhall always have leiſure and diſpoſition to put up thy Affronts; and that thy whole buſineſs ſhall be to ſtudy new Offences, and mine to give thee new Pardons? Doſt thou not know, excommunicated Traitor, (for certainly Excommunication is the leaſt Puniſhment can fall upon thee, after ſuch Profanations of the peerleſs <hi>Dulcinea</hi>'s Name,) and art thou not aſſur'd, vile Slave and ignominious Vagabond, that I ſhou'd not have ſtrength ſufficient to kill a Flea, did not ſhe give ſtrength to my Nerves, and infuſe Vigour into my Sinews? Speak, thou Villain with the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per's Tongue; who doſt thou imagine has reſtor'd the Queen to her Kingdom, cut off the Head of the Giant, and made thee a Marqueſs (for I count all this as done already,) but the Power of <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> who makes uſe of my Arm, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of her Act in me? She fights and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes in me; and I live and breath in her, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life and Being from her. Thou baſe born Wretch! art thou not poſſeſs'd of the utmoſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, thou who ſeeſt thy ſelf exalted from the very Dregs of the Earth to Nobility and Honour, and yet doſt repay ſo great a Benefit

with Obloquies againſt the Perſon of thy Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factreſs?</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Sancho</hi> was not ſo mightily hurt, but he cou'd hear what his Maſter ſaid well enough; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore getting upon his Legs in all haſte, he ran for ſhelter behind <hi>Dorothea</hi>'s Palfry, and being got thither, hark you, Sir, cry'd he to him, if you have no thoughts of marrying this ſame Lady, it's a clear caſe that the Kingdom will never be yours; and if it be not, what good can you be able to do me? Then let any one judge whether I have not cauſe to complain. Therefore, good your Worſhip, marry her once for all, now we have her here rain'd down as it were from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to us, and you may after keep Company with my Lady <hi>Dulcinea;</hi> for I gueſs you'll not be the only King in the World, that has kept a Miſs or two in a corner. As for Beauty, d' you ſee, I'll not meddle nor make; for (if I muſt ſay the truth) I like both the Gentlewomen well enough in Conſcience; tho', now I think on't, I have never ſeen the Lady <hi>Dulcinea.</hi> How, not ſeen her, blaſphemous Traitor, reply'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> when juſt now thou brought'ſt me a Meſſage from her! I ſay, anſwer'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> I have not ſeen her ſo leiſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as to take notice of her Features and good Parts one by one; but yet, as I ſaw 'em at a bluſh and all at once, me thought I had no reaſon to find fault with 'em. Well, I pardon thee now, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and thou muſt excuſe me for the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure I have given thee; for the firſt Motions are not in our Power. I perceive that well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> and that's the reaſon my firſt Motions are always in my Tongue; and I can't for my life help ſpeaking what comes uppermoſt. However, Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> thou hadſt beſt think before thou ſpeakeſt; for the Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:54446:210"/>
never goes ſo oft to the Well—I need ſay no more. Well, what muſt be muſt be, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd <hi>Sancho;</hi> there's ſomebody above who ſees all, and will one day judge which has moſt to anſwer for, whether I for ſpeaking amiſs, or you for doing ſo. No more of this, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid <hi>Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea,</hi> but run, and kiſs your Lord's Hands, and beg his Pardon; and, for the time to come, be more advis'd and cautious how you run into the Praiſe or Diſpraiſe of any Perſon; but eſpecially take care you do not ſpeak ill of that Lady of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſo,</hi> whom I do not know, tho' I am ready to do her any Service; and for your own Part, truſt in Heaven; for you ſhall infallibly have a Lordſhip, which ſhall enable you to live like a Prince. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> ſhrug'd up his Sholders, and in a ſneaking Poſture went and ask'd his Maſter for his Hand, which he held out to him with a grave Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; and after the Squire had kiſs'd the back of it, the Knight gave him his Bleſſing, and told him he had a word or two with him, bidding him come nearer, that he might have the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of ſpeaking to him. <hi>Sancho</hi> did as his Maſter commanded, and going a little from the Company with him; ſince thy Return, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> addreſſing himſelf to him, I have neither had time nor opportunity to inquire into the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of thy Embaſſy, and the Anſwer thou haſt brought; and therefore ſince Fortune has now befriended us with Convenience and Leiſure, deny me not the ſatisfaction thou may'ſt give me by the rehearſal of thy News.

                              </gap> Anſwer; but, good your Worſhip, for the time to come I beſeech you don't be too haſty. What occaſion haſt thou, <hi>Sancho,</hi> to make this requeſt, reply'd Don <hi>Quixote?</hi> Reaſon good enough truly,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:54446:210"/>
ſaid <hi>Sancho;</hi> for the Blows you gave me e'en now, were rather giv'n me on Account of the Quarrel which the Devil ſtirr'd up between your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and me t'other Night, than for your Diſlike of any thing which was ſpoken againſt my Lady <hi>Dulcinea.</hi> Prithee, <hi>Sancho,</hi> cry'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> be careful of falling again into ſuch irreverent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; for they provoke me to anger, and are highly offenſive. I pardon'd thee then for being a Delinquent, but thou are ſenſible that a new Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence muſt be attended with a new Puniſhment. As they were going on in ſuch diſcourſe as this, they ſaw at a diſtance a Perſon riding up to 'em on an Aſs, who, as he came near enough to be diſtinguiſh'd, ſeem'd to be a Gipſy by his Habit. But <hi>Sancho Pança,</hi> who, whenever he got ſight of any Aſſes, follow'd them with his Eyes and his Heart, as one whoſe Thoughts were ever fix'd on his own, had ſcarce giv'n him half an Eye, but he knew him to be <hi>Gines de Paſſamonte,</hi> and by the Looks of the Gipſy found out the Viſage of his Aſs; as really it was the very ſame which <hi>Gines</hi> had got under him; who to conceal himſelf from the knowledge of the Publick, and have the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter opportunity of making a good Market of his Beaſt, had cloth'd himſelf like a Gipſy; the Cant of that ſort of People, as well as the Languages of other Countries, being as natural and familiar to him as his own. <hi>Sancho</hi> ſaw him, and knew him; and ſcarce had he ſeen and taken notice of him, when he cry'd out as loud as his Tongue would permit him: Ah! thou Thief <hi>Geneſillo,</hi> leave my Goods and Chattels behind thee; get off from the back of my own dear Life: Thou haſt nothing to do with my poor Beaſt, without whom I can't enjoy a moment's Eaſe: Away from my Dapple, away from my Comfort; take
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:54446:211"/>
to thy heels thou Villain; hence thou Hedge-bird, leave what is none of thine. He had no occaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to uſe ſo many, Words; for <hi>Gines</hi> diſmounted as ſoon as he heard him ſpeak, and taking to his heels, got from 'em, and was out of ſight in an inſtant. <hi>Sancho</hi> ran immediately to his Aſs, and imbrac'd him: How haſt thou done, cry'd he, ſince I ſaw thee, my Darling and Treaſure, my dear Dapple, the Delight of my Eyes, and my deareſt Companion? And then he ſtroak'd and ſlabber'd him with Kiſſes, as if the Beaſt had been a rational Creature. The Aſs for his part was as ſilent as cou'd be, and gave <hi>Sancho</hi> the Liberty of as many Kiſſes as he pleas'd, without the return of ſo much as one word to the many Queſtions he had put to him. At ſight of this the reſt of the Company came up with him, and paid their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements of Congratulation to <hi>Sancho</hi> for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of his Aſs, eſpecially Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> who told him that tho' he had found his Aſs again, yet would not he revoke the Warrant he had giv'n him for the three Aſſes; for which favour <hi>Sancho</hi> return'd him a multitude of Thanks.</p>
                           <p>While they were travelling together, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing after this manner, the Curate addreſs'd himſelf to <hi>Dorothea,</hi> and gave her to underſtand, that ſhe had excellently diſcharg'd her ſelf of what ſhe had undertaken, as well in the Management of the Hiſtory it ſelf, as in her Brevity, and adapting her Stile to the particular Terms made uſe of in Books of Knight-Errantry. She return'd for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that ſhe had frequently convers'd with ſuch Romances, but that ſhe was ignorant of the Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Provinces, and the Sea Ports, which occaſion'd the Blunder ſhe had made, by ſaying that ſhe landed at <hi>Oſſuna.</hi> I perceiv'd it, reply'd the Curare, and therefore I put in what you heard
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:54446:211"/>
which brought matters to rights again. But is it not an amazing thing to ſee how ready this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Gentleman is to give credit to theſe fictitious Reports, only becauſe they have the Air of the extravagant Stories in Books of Knight-Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantry? <hi>Cardenio</hi> ſaid, that he thought this ſo ſtrange a Madneſs, that he did not believe the Wit of Man cou'd deviſe any thing like it, ſhou'd any one ever ſtart the thought of ſuch another. The Gentleman, reply'd the Curate, has ſome Qualities in him, ev'n as ſurprizing in a Madman, as his unparallel'd Frenzy: For, take him but off from his Romantick Humour, to diſcourſe with him of any other Subject, you will find him to handle it with a great deal of Reaſon, and ſhew himſelf by his Converſation to have very clear and entertaining Conceptions: Inſomuch, that if Knight-Errantry bears no relation to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, there is no Man but will eſteem him for his vivacity of Wit, and ſtrength of Judgment. While they were thus diſcourſing, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> proſecuting his Converſe with his Squire, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid he, let us lay aſide all manner of Animoſity, and tell me as ſpeedily as thou canſt, without any remains of thy laſt diſpleaſure, how, when, and where didſt thou find my Lady <hi>Dulcinea?</hi> What was ſhe doing when thou firſt pay'ſt thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to her? How didſt thou expreſs thy ſelf to her? What Anſwer was ſhe pleas'd to make thee? What Countenance did ſhe put on at the peruſal of my Letter? Who tranſcrib'd it fairly for thee? and every thing elſe which has any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to this Affair, without Addition, Lies, or Flattery. On the other ſide take care thou loſeſt not a Tittle of the whole matter, by abbreviating it, leſt thou rob me of part of that delight which I propoſe to my ſelf from it. Sir, anſwer'd <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi>
                              <pb n="374" facs="tcp:54446:212"/>
if I muſt ſpeak the truth, and nothing but the truth, no body copy'd out the Letter for me; for I carry'd none at all. That's right, cry'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> for I found the Pocket-Book, in which it was written, two days after thy departure, which occaſion'd exceeding grief in me, becauſe I knew not what thou couldſt do, when thou found'ſt thy ſelf without the Letter; and I could not but be induc'd to believe that thou wouldſt have return'd in order to take it with Thee. I had certainly done ſo, reply'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> were it not for this Head of mine, which kept it in Remembrance ever ſince your Worſhip read it to me, and help'd me to ſay it over to a Pariſh-Clerk, who writ it out for me word for word ſo purely, that he ſwore, tho' he had written out many a Letter of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his time, he never in all the days of his life had read or ſeen any thing ſo well ſpoken as it was. And doſt thou ſtill retain the Memory of it, my dear <hi>Sancho,</hi> cry'd Don <hi>Quixote?</hi> Not I, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> for as ſoon as I had giv'n it her, and your turn was ſerv'd, I was very willing to forget it. But if I remember any thing, 'tis what was on the top; and it was thus: <hi>High and Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene,</hi> I would ſay, <hi>Soveraign Lady;</hi> and at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, <hi>Yours untill Death, The Knight of the Woful Figure;</hi> and I put between theſe two things, three hundred <hi>Souls,</hi> and <hi>Lives,</hi> and <hi>Pigſnyes.</hi>

                           <p>ALL this is mighty well, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> proceed therefore: You arriv'd, and how was that Queen of Beauty then employ'd? On my Conſcience thou found'ſt her ſtringing of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rient Pearls, or imbroideing ſome curious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in Gold for me her Captive Knight; was it not ſo, my <hi>Sancho?</hi> No faith, anſwer'd the Squire, I found her winnowing a parcel of Wheat very ſeriouſly, in the back Yard. Then ſaid the Don, you may reſt aſſur'd that every Corn of that Wheat was a Grain of Pearl, ſince ſhe did it the honour of touching it with her Divine Hand. Didſt thou obſerve the quality of the Wheat, was it not of the fineſt ſort? Very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different I thought, ſaid the Squire. Well, this, it leaſt, you muſt allow; it muſt make the fineſt whiteſt Bread, if ſifted by her white Hands: but go on; when you deliver'd my Letter, did ſhe kiſs it? Did ſhe treaſure it in her Boſom, or what Ceremony did ſhe uſe worthy ſuch a Letter? How did ſhe behave her ſelf? Why truly Sir, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> when I offer'd her the Letter, ſhe was very buſy handling her Sieve; and, prithee honeſt Friend, ſaid ſhe, do ſo much as lay that Letter down upon the Sack there; I can't read it till I have winnow'd out what's in my hands. O
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:54446:213"/>
unparallel'd Diſcretion, cry'd Don <hi>Quixote!</hi> ſhe knew that a Peruſal requir'd leiſure, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deferr'd it for her more pleaſing and private Hours. But on, my Squire; while ſhe was thus employ'd, what Conferences paſt? what did ſhe ask about her Knight, and what did you reply? Say all, ſay all, my deareſt <hi>Sancho,</hi> let not the ſmalleſt Circumſtance ſcape thy Tongue; ſpeak all that Thought can frame, or Pen deſcribe. Her Queſtions were eaſily anſwer'd, Sir, ſaid <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> for ſhe ask'd me none at all: I told her indeed in what a ſad pickle I had left you for her ſake, naked to the Waſte; that you eat and ſlept like the Brute Beaſts; that you wou'd let a Raſor as ſoon touch your Throat as your Beard; that you were ſtill blubbering and crying, or ſwearing and curſing your Fortune. There you miſtook, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> I rather, bleſs my Fortune, and always ſhall, while Life affords me Breath, ſince I am thought to merit the eſteem of ſo high a Lady as <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo.</hi> There you hit it, ſaid <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> ſhe is a high Lady indeed Sir, for ſhe's taller than I am by a Foot and a half. Why, how now, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid the Knight, haſt thou meaſur'd thy length with her! Ay marry did I, Sir, ſaid the Squire; for you muſt know, that ſhe deſir'd me to lend her a hand in lifting a Sack of Wheat on an Aſs; ſo we buckl'd about it, and I came ſo cloſe to her, that I found ſhe was taller than I by a full ſpan at leaſt. Right, anſwered Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote,</hi> but thou art alſo conſcious that the uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Stature of her Perſon is adorn'd with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Graces and Endowments of Soul; but <hi>Sancho,</hi> when you approach'd the charming She, did not an Aromatick Smell ſtrike thy Senſe, a Scent ſo Odoriferous, pleaſing, and ſweet, as I want a Name for it; ſweet as—you underſtand
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:54446:213"/>
me, as the richeſt Fragrancy diffus'd around a Perfumer's Magazine of Odours? this at leaſt you muſt grant me. I did indeed feel a ſort of Scent a little unſavory, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſomewhat vigorous or ſo; for I ſuppoſe ſhe had wrought hard, and ſweat ſomewhat plentifully. 'Tis falſe, anſwer'd the Knight, thy ſmelling has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd by thy own Scent, or ſome Canker in thy Noſe; if thou cou'dſt tell the Scent of opening Roſes, fragrant Lillies, or the choiceſt Amber, then thou might'ſt gueſs at her's. Cry mercy, Sir, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> it may be ſo indeed, for I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that I my ſelf have ſmelt very oft juſt as Madam <hi>Dulcinea</hi> did then; and that ſhe ſhou'd ſmell like me is no ſuch wondrous thing neither, ſince there's never a Barrel the better Herring of us. But now, ſaid the Knight, ſuppoſing the Corn winnow'd and diſpatch'd to the Mill; what did ſhe after ſhe had read my Letter? Your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Sir! anſwer'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> your Letter was not read at all, Sir; as for her part, ſhe ſaid, ſhe cou'd neither read nor write, and ſhe would truſt no body elſe, leſt they ſhould tell tales; and ſo ſhe cunningly tore your Letter. She ſaid that what I told her by Word of Mouth of your Love and Penance, was enough: To make ſhort now, ſhe gave her Service to you, and ſaid ſhe had rather ſee you than hear from you; and ſhe pray'd you, if ever you lov'd her, upon ſight of me forthwith to leave your Madneſs among the Buſhes here, and come ſtrait to <hi>Toboſo</hi> (if you be at leiſure,) for ſhe has ſomething to ſay to you, and has a huge Mind to ſee you: She had like to burſt with laughing, when I call'd you the Knight of the <hi>Woful Figure.</hi> She told me the <hi>Biſcayan</hi> whom you maul'd ſo was there, and that he was a very honeſt Fellow,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:54446:214"/>
but that ſhe heard no News at all of the Gally-Slaves.</p>
                           <p>Thus far all goes well, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> but tell me pray, what Jewel did ſhe preſent you at your departure, as a reward for the News you brought? for 'tis a Cuſtom of ancient ſtanding among Knights and Ladies-Errant, to beſtow on Squires, Dwarfs, or Damſels, who bring them good News of their Ladies or Servants, ſome precious Jewel as a grateful Reward of their welcom Tidings. Ay, Sir, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> that was the Faſhion in the days of yore; and a very good Faſhion, I take it: But all the Jewels <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> got, was a Luncheon of Bread and a piece of Cheeſe, which ſhe handed to me over the Wall, when I was taking my Leave; by the ſame To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken (I hope there's no Ill Luck in't) the Cheeſe was made of Sheep's Milk. 'Tis ſtrange, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> for ſhe is Liberal, even to Profuſeneſs; and if ſhe preſented thee not a Jewel, ſhe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly had none about her at that time; but what is deferr'd is not loſt, I ſhall ſee her, and Matters ſhall be accommodated. Know'ſt thou <hi>Sancho,</hi> what raiſes my Aſtoniſhment; 'tis thy ſudden return; for proportioning thy ſhort Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to the length of thy Journey, <hi>Toboſo</hi> being at leaſt thirty Leagues diſtant, thou muſt have ridden on the Wind; certainly the ſagacious Inchanter who is my Guardian and Friend, (for doubtleſs ſuch a one there is and ought to be, or I ſhou'd not be a true Knight-Errant,) certainly I ſay, that wiſe Magician has further'd thee on thy Journey unawares; for there are Sages of ſuch incredible Power, as to take up a Knight-Errant ſleeping in his Bed, and waken him next Morning a Thouſand Leagues from the place where he fell aſleep.

ſuccour one another in their moſt danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Exigents, when, and where they pleaſe; for Inſtance, ſuppoſe me Fighting in the Mountains of <hi>Armenia</hi> with ſome helliſh Monſter, ſome dreadful Spright, or fierce Gigantick Knight, where perhaps I am like to be worſted, (ſuch a thing may happen,) when juſt in the very Criſis of my Fate, when I leaſt expect it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold on the top of a flying Cloud, or riding in a flaming Chariot, another Knight my Friend, who but a Minute before was in <hi>England</hi> perhaps; he ſuſtains me, delivers me from Death, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns that Night to his own Lodging, where he Sups with a very good Appetite after his Journey, having Rid you two or three thouſand Leagues that Day: And all this perform'd by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and Wiſdom of theſe knowing Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, whoſe only Buſineſs and Charge is glorious Knight-Errantry. Some ſuch Expeditious Power, I believe <hi>Sancho,</hi> though hidden from you, has promoted ſo great a diſpatch in your late Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. I believe indeed (anſwer'd <hi>Sancho</hi>) that there was Witchcrafr in the Caſe, for <hi>Rozinante</hi> rid without a Spur all the way, and was as mettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom as though he had been a Gipſy's Aſs with Quickſilver in his Ears. Quickſilver! You Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb, ſaid the Knight, ay, and a Troop of Devils beſides; and they are the beſt Horſe-courſers in Nature you muſt know, for they muſt needs go whom the Devil drives; but no more of that. What is thy Advice as to my Lady's Commands to viſit her? I know her Power ſhould regulate my Will; but then my Honour, <hi>Sancho,</hi> my ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Promiſe has engag'd me to the Princeſs's Service that comes with us, and the Law of Arms confines me to my Word: Love draws me one, and Glory t'other way; on this ſide <hi>Dulcinea</hi>'s
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:54446:215"/>
ſtrict Commands, on the other my promis'd Faith; but—'tis reſolv'd. I'll travel Night and Day, cut off this Giant's Head, and having ſettl'd the Princeſs in her Dominions, will preſently return to ſee that Sun which enlightens my Senſes: She will eaſily condeſcend to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe my Abſence, when I convince her 'twas for her Fame and Glory; ſince the paſt, preſent, and future Succeſs of my Victorious Arms depends wholly on the gracious Influences of her Favour, and the Honour of being her Knight. Oh ſad, oh ſad! ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> I doubt your Worſhip's Head is much the worſe for wearing: Are you Head, Sir, to take ſo long a Voyage for nothing? Why don't you catch at this Perferment that now offers, where a fine Kingdom is the Portion, twenty thouſand Leagues round, they ſay; nay, bigger than <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Caſtile</hi> both together— Good your Worſhip! hold your Tongue, I wonder you are not aſham'd—take a Fool's Counſel for once, Marry her by the firſt Prieſt you meet, here's our own Curate can do the Job moſt curiouſly: Come Maſter. I have Hair enough in my Beard to make a Councellor, and my Advice is as fit for you, as your Shooe for your Foot; a Bird in Hand is worth two in the Buſh, and

                           <p>Thou adviſeſt me thus, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote,</hi> that I may be able to Promote thee accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my Promiſe; but that I can do without Marrying this Lady: For I ſhall make this the Condition of entring into Battel; that after my Victory, without Marrying the Princeſs, ſhe
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:54446:215"/>
ſhall leave part of her Kingdom at my diſpoſal, to gratify whom I pleaſe; and who can claim any ſuch Gratuity but thy ſelf? That's plain, anſwer'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> but pray Sir, take care that you reſerve ſome part near the Sea-ſide for me; that if the Air does not agree with me, I may tranſport my Black Slaves, make my Profit of them, and go live ſomewhere elſe; ſo that I would have you reſolve upon it preſently, leave the Lady <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinea</hi> for the preſent, and go kill this ſame Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, and make an end of that Buſineſs firſt, for I dare ſwear 'twill yield you a good Market. I am fix'd in thy Opinion (ſaid Don <hi>Quixote</hi>) but I admoniſh thee not to whiſper to any Perſon the leaſt hint of our Conference; for ſince <hi>Dulcinea</hi> is ſo cautious and ſecret, 'tis proper that I and mine ſhould follow her Example. Why the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil then, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſhould you ſend every Body you overcome packing to Madam <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> to fall down before her, and tell her they came from you to pay their Obedience, when this tells all the World that ſhe's your Miſtreſs as much as if they had it under your own Hand? How dull of Apprehenſion and Stupid thou art, ſaid the Knight; haſt thou not Sence to find that all this redounds to her greater Glory? Know that in proceedings of Chivalry, a Lady's Honour is Calculated from the number of her Servants, whoſe Services muſt not tend to any reward, but the Favour of her Acceptance, and the pure Honour of performing them for her ſake, and being call'd her Servants. I have heard our Curate, anſwer'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> Preach up this Doctrine of loving for Love's-ſake, and that we ought to love our Maker ſo for his own-ſake, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either hope of Good, or fear of Pain; though for my part I would love and ſerve him for what
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:54446:216"/>
I could get. Thou art an unaccountable Fellow, cry'd Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> thou talk'ſt ſometimes with ſo much Senſe, that one would imagine thee to be ſomething of a Scholar. A Schollard, Sir, anſwer'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> lack a-day, I don't know, as I'm an honeſt Man, a Letter in the Book. Maſter <hi>Nicholas</hi> ſeeing them ſo deep in Diſcourſe, call'd to them to ſtop and drink at a little Fountain by the Road: Don <hi>Quixote</hi> halted, and <hi>Sancho</hi> was very glad of the Interruption, his Stock of Lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almoſt ſpent, and he ſtood in Danger beſides of being trapp'd in his Words, for he had never ſeen <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> though he knew ſhe liv'd at <hi>Toboſo. Cardenio</hi> by this had chang'd his Cloaths for thoſe <hi>Dorothea</hi> wore, when they found her in the Mountains; and though they made but an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Figure, they look'd much better than his own. They all ſtopp'd at the Fountain, and fell aboard the Curate's Proviſion, which was but a Snap among ſo many, for they were all very hungry. While they ſat refreſhing themſelves, a young Lad travelling that way, obſerv'd them, and looking earneſtly on the whole Company, ran ſuddenly and fell down before Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> addreſſing him in a very doleful Manner. Alas, good Sir, ſaid he, don't you know me? don't you remember poor <hi>Andrew</hi> whom you caus'd to be unty'd from the Tree? With that the Knight knew him; and raiſing him up, turn'd to the Company, That you may all know, ſaid he, of how great Importance to the Redreſſing of Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Puniſhing Vice, and the univerſal Benefit of Mankind the Buſineſs of Knight-Errantry may be, you muſt underſtand, that riding through a Deſart ſome days ago, I heard certain lamentable Screekes and Out-cries: Prompted by the Miſery of the Afflicted, and born away by the Zeal of
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:54446:216"/>
my Profeſſion, I follow'd the Voice, and found this Boy whom you all ſee, bound to a great Oak; I'm glad he's preſent, becauſe he can atteſt the Truth of my Relation. I found him as I told you, bound to an Oak, naked from the Waſte upwards, and a bloudy-minded Peaſant ſcourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Back unmercifully with the Reins of a Bridle. I preſently demanded the cauſe of his ſevere Chaſtiſement? The rude Fellow anſwer'd, That he had liberty to puniſh his own Servant, whom he thus us'd for ſome Faults that argu'd him more Knave than Fool. Good Sir, ſaid the Boy, he can lay nothing to my Charge, but demanding my Wages. His Maſter made ſome reply, which I would not allow as a juſt Excuſe; and order'd him immediately to unbind the Youth, and took his Oath that he would take him home and pay him all his Wages upon the Nail, in good and lawful Coin. Is not this literally true <hi>Andrew?</hi> Did you not mark beſides with what Face of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority I Commanded, and with how much Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility he promis'd to obey all I impos'd, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and deſir'd? Anſwer me, Boy, and tell boldly all that paſs'd to this worthy Company, that it may appear how neceſſary the Vocation of Knight-Errants is upon the Roads.</p>
                           <p>All you have ſaid is true enough, anſwer'd <hi>Andrew,</hi> but the Buſineſs did not end after that manner you and I hop'd it would. How? ſaid the Knight, has not the Peaſant paid you? Ay, he has paid me with a Vengeance, ſaid the Boy; for no ſooner was your Back turn'd, but he ty'd me again to the ſame Tree, and laſh'd me ſo cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly, that I look'd like St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi> flea'd alive; and at every blow he had ſome Joke or another to laugh at you; and had he not laid me on as he did, I fancy I could not have help'd laughing
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:54446:217"/>
my ſelf. At laſt he left me in ſo pitiful a Caſe, that I was for'd to crawl to an Hoſpital, where I have lain ever ſince to get cur'd, ſo wofully the Tyrant had laſh'd me. And now I may thank you for this, for had you rid on your Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and neither meddl'd nor made, ſeeing no Body ſent for you, and 'twas none of your Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, my Maſter perhaps had been ſatisfy'd with giving me ten or twenty Laſhes, and after that would have paid me what he ow'd me; but you was ſo huffy, and call'd him ſo many Names, that it made him mad, and ſo he vented all his Spight againſt you upon my poor Back as ſoon as yours was turn'd, inſomuch that I fear I ſhall never be my own Man again. The Miſcarriage, anſwer'd the Knight, is only chargeable on my departure before I ſaw my Orders executed; for I might by Experience have remembred, that the Word of a Peaſant is regulated, not by Honour, but Profit. But you remember, <hi>Andrew,</hi> how I ſwore if he diſobey'd, that I would return and ſeek him through the Univerſe, and find him tho' hid in the Whale's Belly. Ay, Sir anſwer'd <hi>Andrew,</hi> but that's no cure for my ſore Shoulders. You ſhall be redreſs'd, anſwer'd the Knight, ſtarting fiercely up, and commanding <hi>Sancho</hi> immediately to bridle <hi>Rozinante,</hi> who was Baiting as faſt as the reſt of the Company. <hi>Dorothea</hi> ask'd what he intended to do? he anſwer'd that he intended to find out the Villain and puniſh him ſeverely for his Crimes, then force him to pay <hi>Andrew</hi> his Wages to the laſt<note n="*" place="bottom">Near the value of a Farthing.</note> 
                              <hi>Mara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedi,</hi> in ſpight of all the Peaſants in the Univerſe. She then deſir'd him to remember his Engagement to her, which withheld him from any new At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievement
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:54446:217"/>
till that was finiſh'd; that he muſt therefore ſuſpend his Reſentments till his Return from her Kingdom. 'Tis but juſt and reaſonable, ſaid the Knight, and therefore <hi>Andrew</hi> muſt wait with Patience my Return; but when I do return, I do hereby Ratify my former Oath and Promiſe, never to reſt till he be fully ſatisfy'd and paid. I dare not truſt to that, anſwer'd <hi>Andrew;</hi> but if you'll beſtow on me as much Money as will bear my Charges to <hi>Sevill,</hi> I ſhall thank your Worſhip more than for all the Revenge you tell me of: Give me a ſnap to eat, and a bit in my Pocket, and ſo Heav'n be wi'ye and all other Knight-Errants, and may they prove as arrant Fools in their own Buſineſs as they have been in mine.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Sancho</hi> took a Cruſt of Bread, and a ſlice of Cheeſe; and reaching it to <hi>Andrew,</hi> there Friend, ſaid he, there's ſomething for thee; on my Word, we have all of us a ſhare of thy Miſchance. What ſhare, ſaid <hi>Andrew?</hi> Why, the curs'd miſchance of parting with this Bread and Cheeſe to thee; for my Head to a Half-penny, I may live to want it; for thou muſt know, Friend of mine, that we the Squires of Knight-Errants often pick our Teeth without a Dinner, and are ſubject to many other things which are better felt than told. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew</hi> ſnatch'd at the Provender, and ſeeing no likelihood of any more, he made his Leg and went off. But looking over his Shoulder at Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote,</hi> hark ye, you Sir Knight-Errant, cry'd he, if ever you meet me again in your Travels, which I hope you never ſhall; though I were torn in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, do'nt trouble me with your plaguy help, but mind your own Buſineſs; and ſo fare you well, with a Curſe upon you and all the Knight-Errants that ever were born. The Knight thought to Chaſtiſe him, but the Lad was too nimble for
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:54446:218"/>
any there, and his Heels carry'd him off; leaving Don <hi>Quixote</hi> highly incens'd at his Story, which mov'd the Company to hold their Laughter, leſt they ſhould raiſe his Anger to a dangerous height.</p>

                              </gap>, ſaid the Hoſteſs, pay us better than you did then, and you ſhall have a Bed for a Prince; and upon the Knight's Promiſe that he would, ſhe provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him a tolerable Bed in the large Room where he lay before: He preſently undreſs'd, and being heartily craz'd in Body as well as in Mind, he went to Bed; he was ſcarcely got to his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, when the Hoſteſs flew ſuddenly at the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and catching him by the Beard; on my life; ſaid ſhe, you ſhall uſe my Tail no longer for a
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:54446:218"/>
Beard, pray Sir give me my Tail, my Husband wants it to ſtick his thing into, his Comb I mean, and my Tail I will have, Sir. The Barber held tugg with her till the Curate advis'd him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn it, telling him that he might now undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe himſelf, and tell Don <hi>Quixote</hi> that after the Gally-Slaves had pillag'd him, he fled to that Inn; and if he ſhould ask for the Princeſs's Squire, he ſhou'd pretend that he was diſpatch'd to her King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom before her, to give her Subjects an Account of her arrival, and of the Power ſhe brought to free them all from Slavery. The Barber thus ſchool'd, gave the Hoſteſs her Tail, with the other Trinkets which he had borrow'd to decoy Don <hi>Quixote</hi> out of the Deſart. <hi>Dorothea</hi>'s Beauty, and <hi>Cardenio</hi>'s handſome Shape ſurpriz'd every Body. The Curate beſpoke Supper, and the Hoſt being pretty ſecure of his Reckoning, ſoon got them a tolerable Entertainment. They would not diſturb the Knight, who ſlept very ſoundly, for his Diſtemper wanted Reſt more than Meat; but they diverted themſelves with the Hoſteſs's Account of his Encounter with the Carriers, and of <hi>Sancho</hi>'s being toſs'd in a Blanket. Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s unaccountable Madneſs was the principal Subject of their Diſcourſe, upon which the Curate inſiſting, and arguing it to proceed from his reading Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, the Inn-keeper took him up. Sir, ſaid he, you can't make me of your Opinion; for in my Mind, it is the pleaſanteſt Reading that ever was. I have now in the Houſe two or three Books of that kind, and ſome other Pieces, that really have kept me and many others alive. In Harveſt-time a great many of the Reapers come to drink here in the heat of the Day, and he that can read beſt among us takes up one of theſe Books; and all the reſt of us, ſometimes thirty
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:54446:219"/>
or more, ſit round about him, and liſten with ſuch pleaſure, that we think neither of Sorrow nor Care; as for my own Part, when I hear the mighty Blows and dreadful Battels of theſe Knight-Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, I have half a mind to be one my ſelf, and am rais'd to ſuch a life and briskneſs, that I frighten away old-Age; I could ſit and hear them from Morning till Night. I wiſh you wou'd Husband, ſaid the Hoſteſs, for then we ſhould have ſome reſt; for at all other times you are ſo out of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and ſo ſnappiſh, that we lead a helliſh life with you. That's true enough, ſaid <hi>Maritornes;</hi> and for my part I think there are mighty pretty Stories in thoſe Books, eſpecially that one about the young Lady who is hugg'd ſo ſweetly by her Knight under the Orange-Tree, when the Damſel watches leſt ſome Body comes, and ſtands with her Mouth watering all the while; and a thouſand ſuch Stories, which I would often forgot my Dinner and Supper to hear. And what think you of this Matter young Miſs, ſaid the Curate to the Inn-Keepers Daughter? Alack a-day, Sir, ſaid ſhe, I don't underſtand thoſe things, and yet I love to hear 'em; but I don't like that frightful ugly fighting that ſo pleaſes my Father. Indeed the ſad Lamentations of the poor Knights for the Loſs of their Miſtreſſes, ſometimes makes me cry like any thing. I ſuppoſe then young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, ſaid <hi>Dorothea,</hi> you will be tender-hearted, and will never let a Lover die for you. I don't know what may happen as to that, ſaid the Girl; but this I know, that I will never give any Body reaſon to call me Tygreſs and Lionneſs, and I don't know how many other ugly Names, as thoſe Ladies are often call'd, and I think they deſerve yet worſe, ſo they do; for they can have neither Soul or Conſcience to let ſuch fine Gentlemen die
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:54446:219"/>
or run mad for a ſight of them? What ſignifies all their fiddling and coyneſs? If they are civil Women, why don't they Marry 'em, for that's all their Knights wou'd be at? Hold your prating Miſtreſs, ſaid the Hoſteſs, how came you to know all this? 'Tis not for ſuch as you to talk of theſe Matters. The Gentleman only ask'd me a Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſaid ſhe, and it would be uncivil not to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him. Well, ſaid the Curate, do me the favour, good Landlord, to bring out theſe Books that I may have a ſight of them.</p>
                           <p>With all my Heart, ſaid the Inn-keeper; and with that ſtepping to his Chamber, he open'd a little Portmantle that ſhut with a Chain, and took out three large Volumes with a parcel of Manuſcripts in a fair legible Letter: The Title of the firſt was Don <hi>Cirongilio</hi> of <hi>Thrace,</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Felixmarte</hi> of <hi>Hircania,</hi> and the third was the Hiſtory of the Great Captain <hi>Gonçalo Hernandez de Corduba,</hi> and the Life of <hi>Diego Garcia de Paredes,</hi> bound together. The Curate reading the Titles, turn'd to the Barber, and told him, they wanted now Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Houſe-keeper and his Niece; I ſhall do as well with the Books ſaid the Barber, for I can find the way to the Back-yard, or the Chimney, there's a good Fire that will do their Buſineſs. Buſineſs! ſaid the Inn-keeper, I hope you wou'd not burn my Books. Only two of them, ſaid the Curate, this ſame Don <hi>Cirongilio</hi> and his Friend <hi>Felixmarte.</hi> I hope Sir, ſaid the Hoſt, they are neither Hereticks nor Flegmaticks, Schiſmaticks you mean, ſaid the Barber; I mean ſo ſaid the Inn-keeper, and if you muſt burn any, let it be this of <hi>Gonçalo Hernandez</hi> and <hi>Diego Garcia,</hi> for you ſhould ſooner burn one of my Children than the others. Theſe Books honeſt Friend, ſaid the Curate, that you appear ſo concern'd for,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:54446:220"/>
are ſenſleſs Rhapſodies of Falſhoods and Folly; and this which you ſo deſpiſe is a true Hiſtory, and contains a true Account of two celebrated Men; the firſt by his Bravery and Courage pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd immortal Fame, and the Name of the Great General, by the univerſal Conſent of Mankind. The other, <hi>Diego Garcia de Paredes,</hi> was of Noble Extraction, and born in <hi>Truxillo</hi> a Town of <hi>Eſtremadura,</hi> and was a Man of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Courage, and ſuch mighty Strength, that with one of his Hands he could ſtop a Mill-wheell in its moſt rapid Motion; and with his ſingle Force defended the Paſſage of a Bridge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a great Army. Several other great Actions are related in the Memoirs of his Life, but all with ſo much Modeſty and unbiaſs'd Truth, that they eaſily pronounce him his own Hiſtoriogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher; and had they been written by any one elſe, with Freedom and Impartiality, they might have eclips'd your <hi>Hector's, Achilloſes,</hi> and <hi>Orlando's</hi> with all their Heroick Exploits. That's a fine Jeſt, faith, ſaid the Inn-keeper, my Father could have told you another Tale, Sir. Holding a Mill-wheel! why, is that ſuch a mighty Matter! one's fiſh, do but turn over a Leaf of <hi>Felixmarte</hi> there; you'll find how with one ſingle Back-ſtroke he cut five ſwinging Giants off by the middle, like ſo many Bean-ſtalks; and read how at other time he Charg'd a moſt Mighty and Powerful Army of above a Million and Six hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand fighting Men, all Arm'd Cap-a-pee, and Routed them all like ſo many Sheep. And what can you ſay of the Worthy <hi>Cirongilio</hi> of <hi>Thrace,</hi> who, as you may read there, going by Water one Day, was aſſaulted by a fiery Serpent in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the River; he preſently leap'd nimbly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her Back, and hanging by her Scaly Neck
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:54446:220"/>
graſp'd her Throat faſt with both his Arms, ſo that the Serpent finding her ſelf almoſt ſtrangl'd, was forc'd to dive into the Water to ſave her ſelf, and carry'd the Knight who would not quit his hold, to the very bottom, where he found a Stately Palace and ſuch pleaſant Gardens, that 'twas a wonder; and ſtrait the Serpent turn'd into a very old Man, and told him ſuch things as were never heard nor ſpoken.—Now a Fig for your great Captain, and your <hi>Diego Garcia. Cardenio</hi> and <hi>Dorothea</hi> hearing the vehemence of his Diſcourſe, imagin'd that he wou'd make another Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> I tell thee Friend, (ſaid the Curate) there were never any ſuch Perſons as your Books of Chivalry mention, upon the Face of the Earth; your <hi>Felixmarte</hi> of <hi>Hircania,</hi> and your <hi>Cirongilio</hi> of <hi>Thrace,</hi> are all but Chimeras and Fictions of idle and luxuriant Wits, who wrote them for the ſame Reaſon that you read them, becauſe they had nothing elſe to do. Sir, (ſaid the Inn-keeper) you muſt Angle with another Bait, or you'll catch no Fiſh. I know what's what, as well as another; I can tell where my own Shooe pinches me; and you muſt not think Sir, to catch old Birds with Chaff; 'tis a pleaſant Jeſt, faith, that you ſhould pretend to perſwade me now that theſe notable Books are Lies and Stories; why Sir, are they not in Print? Are they not Publiſh'd according to Order? Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd by Authority from the Privy Council? And do you think that they would permit ſo many Lies to be Printed at once, and ſuch a Number of Battels and Enchantments to ſet us all a madding?

As the Inn-keeper was carrying away the Books, the Curate deſir'd his leave to look over thoſe Manuſcripts which appeared in ſo fair a Character; he reach'd them to him, to the number of eight Sheets, on one of which there was written in a large Hand, <hi>The Novel of the curious Impertinent.</hi> The Title, ſaid the Curate, promiſes ſomething, perhaps it may be worth reading through; your Reverence, ſaid the Inn-keeper, may be worſe employ'd; for

                              <hi>ANſelmo,</hi> and <hi>Lothario,</hi> Conſiderable Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Florence,</hi> the Capital City of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> were ſo eminent for their Friendſhip, that they were call'd nothing but the <hi>Two Friends.</hi> They were both Young and Unmarry'd, of the ſame Age and Humour, which did not a little concur to the continuance of their mutual Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, though, of the two, <hi>Anſelmo</hi> was the moſt Amorouſly inclin'd, and <hi>Lothario</hi> the greater lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Hunting; yet they lov'd one another a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other Conſiderations, and mutually quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their own Pleaſure for their Friend's; and their very Wills, like the different Motions of a well regulated Watch, were always ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to their Unity, and ſtill kept time with one another. <hi>Anſelmo</hi> at laſt, fell deſperately in love with a Beautiful Lady of the ſame City; ſo Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for her Fortune and Family, that he reſolv'd by the Conſent of his Friend (for he did nothing without his Advice) to demand her in Marriage. <hi>Lothario</hi> was the Perſon employ'd in this Affair, which he manag'd with that Addreſs, that in a few days he put his Friend into Poſſeſſion of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milla,</hi> for that was the Lady's Name; and this ſo much to their Satisfaction, that he receiv'd a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Acknowledgments from both, for the equal Happineſs they deriv'd from his endeavours. <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thario,</hi> as long as the Nuptials laſted, was every
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:54446:222"/>
day at <hi>Anſelmo</hi>'s, and did all he could to add to the Sports and Diverſions of the Occaſion. But as ſoon as the new marry'd Pair had receiv'd the Congratulation of their Friends, and the Nuptial Ceremonies were over, <hi>Lothario</hi> retir'd with the reſt of their Acquaintance, and forbore his Viſits, becauſe he prudently imagin'd, that it was not at all proper to be ſo frequent at his Friend's Houſe after Marriage as before; for tho' true Friendſhip entirely Baniſhes all Suſpicion and Jealouſy, yet the Honour of a Marry'd Man is of ſo Nice and tender a Nature, that it has been ſometimes ſully'd by the Converſation of the neareſt Relations, and therefore more liable to ſuffer from that of a Friend. <hi>Anſelmo</hi> obſerv'd this Remiſſneſs of <hi>Lothario,</hi> and, fond as he was of his Wife, ſhew'd by his tender Complaints how much it affected him. He told him, that if he could have believ'd he muſt have loſt ſo dear a Correſpondence by Marriage; as much as he lov'd, he would never have paid ſo great a price for the Satisfaction of his Paſſion; and that he would never for the idle Reputation of a cautious Husband, ſuffer ſo tender and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a Name to be loſt as that of <hi>The two Friends,</hi> which before his Marriage they had ſo happily obtain'd; and therefore he begg'd him, if that were a Term Lawful to be us'd betwixt them two, to return to his former Familiarity and Freedom of Converſation; aſſuring him that his Wife's Will and Pleaſure were entirely form'd by his, and that being acquainted with their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and ſtrict Friendſhip, ſhe was equally ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd at ſo unexpected a Change. <hi>Lothario</hi> reply'd to theſe endearing Perſuaſions of his Friend, with ſuch Prudence and Diſcretion, that he convinc'd him of the ſincerity of his intentions in what
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:54446:223"/>
he had done; and ſo in concluſion they agreed that <hi>Lothario</hi> ſhould Dine twice a Week at his Houſe beſides Holy-days. Yet <hi>Lothario</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with this Reſolution being only not to diſoblige his Friend, he deſign'd to obſerve it no farther then he ſhould find it conſiſtent with <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelmo</hi>'s Honour, whoſe Reputation was as dear to him as his own; and he us'd to tell him, that the Husband of a beautiful Wife ought to be as cautious of the Friends whom he carry'd home to her himſelf, as other female Acquaintance, and Viſitants. For a Friend's, or Relation's Houſe, often renders the contrivance of thoſe things eaſie, and not ſuſpected, which could not be compaſs'd either in the Church, the Markets, or at publick Entertainments and Places of Reſort, which no Man can entirely keep a Woman from frequenting. To this <hi>Anſelmo</hi> reply'd, that for that very Reaſon every Marry'd Man ought to have ſome Friend to put him in mind of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his Conduct; for a Husband's Fondneſs many times makes him either not ſee, or at leaſt for fear of diſpleaſing his Wife, not command or forbid her what may be advantagious or prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to his Reputation. In all which, a Friend's Warning and Advice might ſupply him with a proper Remedy. But where ſhall we find a Friend, ſo qualify'd with Wiſdom and Truth as <hi>Anſelmo</hi> demands? I muſt confeſs I cannot tell, unleſs it were <hi>Lothario,</hi> whoſe Care of his Friend's Honour made him ſo cautious as not to comply with his promis'd viſiting Days, leſt the Malicious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers ſhould give a Scandalous Cenſure of the frequent Admiſſion of ſo well qualify'd a Gentleman, both for his Wit, Fortune, Youth, and Addreſs, to the Houſe of a Lady of ſo celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Beauty as <hi>Camilla.</hi> For though his Virtue
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:54446:223"/>
was ſufficiently known, to check the Growth of any malignant Report, yet he would not ſuffer his Friend's Honour nor his own to run the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of being call'd in Queſtion; which made him ſpend the greateſt part of thoſe Days he had by Promiſe devoted to his Friend's Converſation, in other Places and Employments; yet excuſing his Abſence ſo agreeably, that <hi>Anſelmo</hi> could not deny the Reaſonableneſs of what he alledg'd. And thus the time paſs'd away in pathetick Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations, of want of Love and Friendſhip on one ſide, and plauſible Excuſes on the other.</p>
                           <p>I know very well, ſaid <hi>Anſelmo,</hi> walking one Day in the Fields with his Friend, that of all the Favours and Benefits for which Heaven commands my Gratitude, as the Advantage of my Brith, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and Nature; the greateſt and moſt obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging is the Gift of ſuch a Wife, and ſuch a Friend; being both of you Pledges of ſo great value, that tho' 'tis impoſſible for me to raiſe my Eſteem and Love equal to your Deſerts, yet is no Man capable of having a greater. And yet while I am in Poſſeſſion of all that can or uſually does make a Man happy, I live the moſt diſcontented life in the World. I am not able to tell you when my Miſery began, which now inwardly torments me with ſo ſtrange, extravagant, and ſingular a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that I never reflect on it, but I wonder at my ſelf, and condemn and curb my Folly, and would fain hide my Deſires even from my ſelf: And yet I have receiv'd no more advantage from this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Confuſion, then if I had publiſh'd my Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance to all the World. Since therefore 'tis evident that it will at laſt break out, dear <hi>Lotha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio,</hi> I would have it go no farther than thy known Fidelity and Secreſy; for that and my own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry (which as my Friend thou wilt turn to my
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:54446:224"/>
Aſſiſtance) will quickly I hope free me from the Anguiſh it now gives me, and reſtore me that Tranquility of which my own Folly has now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd me.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Lothario</hi> ſtood in great ſuſpenſe, unable to gueſs at the Conſequence of ſo ſtrange and prolix an Introduction. In vain he rack'd his Imagination for the Cauſes of his Friend's Affliction, the Truth was the laſt thing he could think of; but no longer to remain in doubt, he told <hi>Anſelmo,</hi> that he did his Friendſhip a particular Injury, in not coming directly to the Point in the diſcovery of his Thoughts to him, ſince his Counſels might enable him to ſupport, and perhaps to loſe or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs ſuch importunate Deſires.</p>
                           <p>'Tis very true, reply'd <hi>Anſelmo,</hi> and with that Aſſurance I muſt inform you, that the Deſire that gives me ſo much Pain, is to know whether <hi>Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> be really as Virtuous as I think her. Nor can this be made evident but by ſuch a Trial, that like Gold by the Fire the Standard and Degree of her Worth be diſcover'd. For in my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no Woman has more Virtue than ſhe retains after the force of the moſt earneſt Solicitations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                              <hi>Caſta eſt quam nemo rogavit:</hi> And ſhe only may be ſaid to be Chaſte who has withſtood the Force of Tears, Vows, Promiſes, Gifts, and all the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of a Lover that is not eaſily deny'd: For where's the Praiſe of a Woman's Virtue whom no Body has ever endeavour'd to corrupt? Where is the Wonder if a Wife be Reſerv'd, when ſhe has no Temptation nor Opportunity of being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; eſpecially if ſhe have a jealous Husband with whom the leaſt Suſpicion goes for a Reality, and who therefore puniſhes the leaſt Appearances with Death. Now I can never ſo much eſteem her, who owes her Virtue merely to Fear or want
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:54446:224"/>
of Opportunity of being Falſe, as I would one who Victoriouſly ſurmounts all the Aſſaults of a vigorous and watchful Lover, and yet retains her Virtue intire and unſhaken. Theſe, and many others Reaſon, which I could urge to ſtrengthen my Opinion, make me deſire that my <hi>Camilla</hi>'s Virtue may paſs through the fiery Trial of vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Solicitations and Addreſſes, and theſe offer'd by a Gallant, who may have Merit enough to deſerve her good Opinion; and if, as I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſhe will, ſhe be able to reſiſt ſo agreeable a Temptation, I ſhall think my ſelf the moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Man in the World, and attain to the height and utmoſt aim of my Deſires; and ſhall ſay, that a <hi>Virtuous Woman is fallen to my Lot,</hi> of whom the Wiſe Man ſays, <hi>Who can find her?</hi> If ſhe yields, I ſhall at leaſt have the Satisfaction of finding my Opinion of Women juſtify'd; and not be impos'd on by a fooliſh Confidence, that abuſes moſt Men; which Conſideration will be ſufficient to make me ſupport the Grief I ſhall derive from ſo expenſive an Experiment. And, aſſuring my ſelf that nothing which you can ſay can diſſwade me from my Reſolution, I deſire that you your ſelf, my dear Friend, would be the Perſon to put my Deſign in Execution. I will furniſh you with Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities enough of making your Addreſſes, in which I would have you omit nothing you may ſuppoſe likely to prevail, and mollify a Woman of Quality, without Paſſion, and reſerv'd, and diſcreet by Nature. The moſt prevailing Reaſon that makes me chooſe you for this Affair above all others; is, becauſe if ſhe ſhould prove ſo frail as to be overcome by Addreſs and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, the Victory will not coſt me ſo dear, ſince I am ſecur'd from your taking that Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of which another might make no Scruple.
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:54446:225"/>
And ſo my Honour will remain untouch'd, and the intended Injury a Secret, in the Virtue of thy Silence; for I know my Friend ſo well, that Death and the Grave will as ſoon divulge my Affairs. Wherefore if you would give me Life indeed, and deliver me from the moſt perplexing Torment of Doubt, you will immediately begin this Amorous Aſſault, with all that Vigour, Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity, and Courage, I expect from that Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence I put in your Friendſhip.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Lothario</hi> gave ſo great an Attention to <hi>Anſelmo</hi>'s Reaſons, that he gave him no other Interruption, than what we mention'd. But, now finding his Diſcourſe was at an end, full of Amazement at the Extravagance of the Propoſal, he thus reply'd. Could I, my dear <hi>Anſelmo,</hi> perſwade my ſelf that what you have ſaid were any more than a piece of Raillery, I ſhould not have been ſo long ſilent; no, I ſhould have interrupted you at the beginning of your Speech. Sure you know neither your ſelf nor me, <hi>Anſelmo,</hi> or you would never have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd me in ſuch an Affair, if you had not thought me as much alter'd from what I was, as you ſeem to be; for as the Poet has it, <hi>uſque ad aras; A true Friend ought to deſire nothing of his Friend that is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to Heaven.</hi> But ſhould a Man ſo far exert his Friendſhip, as to deviate a little from the Severity of Religion in Complaiſance to his Friend, no trifling Motive can excuſe the Tranſgreſſion, and only his Honour and Life can make any tolerable Apology. Which therefore of theſe <hi>Anſelmo</hi> is in danger, to warrant my undertaking ſo deteſtable a thing as you deſire? Neither, I dare engage: On the contrary, you would make me the Aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of both, in which my own is included; for, to rob you of your Reputation, is to take away your Life, ſince an Infamous Life is worſe than
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:54446:225"/>
Death; and by making me the guilty Inſtrument of this, as you would have me, you make me worſe than a dead Man by the Murder of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. Therefore I deſire you would hear with Patience what I have to urge againſt your extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Deſire, and I ſhall afterwards hear your Reply without Interrpution. <hi>Anſelmo</hi> having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd his Attention, <hi>Lothario</hi> proceeded in this manner. In my Opinion you are not unlike the <hi>Moors,</hi> who are incapable of being convinc'd of the Error of their Religion, by Scripture, ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Reaſons, or thoſe drawn immediately from the Articles of our Faith; and will yield to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Demonſtrations as evident as thoſe of the Mathematicks, and which can as little be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd, as when we ſay, <hi>If from two equal Parts we take away two equal Parts, the Parts that remain are alſo equal.</hi> And when they do not underſtand this Propoſition, which they ſeldom do, we are oblig'd by our Hands, to make it yet more plain and obvious to their Senſes; and yet all this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour will at laſt prove ineffectual to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing them of the Verities of our Religion. The ſame muſt be my Method with you, ſince your ſtrange deſire is ſo very foreign to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Reaſon, that I very much fear I ſhall ſpend my Time and Labour in vain, in endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to convince you of your own Folly, for I can afford it no other Name. Nay, did I not love you as I do, I ſhould leave you to the Proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your own odd Humour, which certainly tends to your Ruine. But to lay your Folly a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more open, you bid me <hi>Anſelmo</hi> attempt a Woman of Honour, cautious of her Reputation, and one who is not much inclin'd to Love; for all theſe good Qualifications you allow her. If therefore you already know your Wife is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:54446:226"/>
of all theſe Advantages of Prudence, Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Honour, and Reſervedneſs, what have you more to enquire after? And if you believe, as I my ſelf do, that ſhe will be impregnable to all my Aſſaults, what greater and better Names will you give her, than ſhe already deſerves? Either you pretend to think better of her, than really you do, or elſe you deſire you know not what your ſelf. But then if you do not believe her as Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as you pretend, why would you put it to the Trial, why do you not rather uſe her as you think ſhe deſerves? On the other hand, if ſhe be as good as you profeſs you believe her, why would you go to tempt Truth and Goodneſs it ſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reaſonable proſpect of Advantage? For when the Trial is over, ſhe will be but the ſame Virtuous Woman ſhe was before. Wherefore 'tis allow'd that it is the effect of Temerity, and want of Reaſon, to attempt what is likely to produce nothing but Danger and Detriment to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker, eſpecially when there is no Neceſſity for it, and when we may eaſily foreſee the Folly of the Undertaking. There are but theſe Motives to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite us to difficult Attempts, Religion, Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, or both together. The firſt makes the Saints endeavour to lead Angelick Lives in theſe frail Bodies, the ſecond makes us expoſe our ſelves to the hazards of long Voyages and Travels in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of Riches. The third Motive is compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of both, and prompts us to act as well for the honour of God as for our own particular Glory and Intereſts; as for Example, the daring Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Valiant Soldier, who urg'd by his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God, his Prince, and his Country, fiercely runs into the midſt of a dreadful Breach, unterri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd with any Conſiderations of the Danger that threatens him. Theſe are things done every Day,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:54446:226"/>
and let them be never ſo dangerous, they give Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Glory, and Profit to thoſe that attempt them. But by the Project you deſign to reduce to an Experiment; you will never obtain, either the Glory of Heaven, Profit, or Reputation: For ſhould the Experiment anſwer your expectation, it will make no Addition either to your Content, Honour, or Riches; but if it diſappoint your Hopes, it makes you the moſt miſerable Man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live. And the imaginary Advantage of no Man's knowing your Diſgrace, will ſoon vaniſh when you conſider, that to know it your ſelf will be enough to ſupply you perpetually with all the tormenting Thoughts in the World. A Proof of this, is what the famous Poet <hi>Ludovico Tanſilo</hi> at the end of his firſt Part of<note place="bottom">This Poem written Originally in Italian, is tranſlated into Spaniſh by <hi>Juan Sedeno,</hi> and into French by <hi>Malherbe.</hi>

So wept that ſimple Doctor, who, as our Poet tells us, made that Experiment on the brittle Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, which the more prudent <hi>Reynoldos</hi> excus'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from doing. This indeed is but a Poetical Fiction, but yet the Moral which it enforces is worthy being obſerv'd and imitated.

This precious <hi>Diamond</hi> my Friend, is your <hi>Camilla,</hi> for ſo ſhe ought to be eſteem'd in all Mens Opinions as well as your own; why then would you imprudently put her in danger of fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſince your Trial will add no greater value to her than ſhe has already? But if ſhe ſhould prove frail, reflect with your ſelf on the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of your Condition, and how juſtly you might complain of your being the Cauſe of both her Ruine and your own. Conſider, that as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt and honeſt Woman is the moſt valuable Jewel in the World, ſo does all Womens Virtue and Honour conſiſt in the Opinion and Reputation they maintain with other People. And ſince that of your Wife is perfect, both in your own and all other Mens Opinion, why will you go, to no purpoſe, to call the reality of it in Queſtion? You

muſt remember, my Friend, that the Nature of Women is at beſt but weak and imperfect; and for that Reaſon we ſhould be ſo far from caſting Rubs in its way, that we ought with all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Care to remove every Appearance that might hinder its Courſe to that Perfection it wants, which is <hi>Virtue.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>If we believe the Naturaliſts, the <hi>Ermine</hi> is a very white little Creature; when the Hunters have found its Haunts, they ſurround it almoſt with Dirt and Mire, towards which the <hi>Ermine</hi> being forc'd to fly, rather than ſully its native White with Dirt, it ſuffers it ſelf to be taken, preferring its Colour to its Liberty and Life. The Virtuous Woman is our <hi>Ermine,</hi> whoſe Chaſtity is whiter than Snow; but to preſerve its Colour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſully'd, you muſt obſerve juſt a contrary Method: The Addreſſes and Services of an importunate Lover, are the Mire into which you ſhould never drive a Woman, for 'tis ten to one ſhe will not be able to free her ſelf and avoid it, being but too apt to ſtumble into it; and therefore that ſhould be always remov'd, and only the Candour and Beauty of Virtue, and the Charms of a good Fame and Reputation plac'd before her. A good Woman is alſo not unlike a Mirrour of Cryſtal, which will infallibly be dimm'd and ſtain'd by breathing too much upon it: She muſt rather be us'd like the Reliques of Saints, ador'd but not touch'd; or like a Garden of curious tender Flowers, that may at a diſtance gratify the Eye, but are not permitted by the Maſter to be tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on or touch'd by every Beholder. I ſhall add but a few Verſes out of a late new Play, very fit for our preſent purpoſe, where a prudent old Man advis'd his Neighbour that had a Daughter, to lock her up cloſe; and gives theſe Reaſons for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſeveral others.</p>

                           <p>All I have hitherto urg'd relates only to you, I may now at laſt be allowed to conſider what regards my ſelf; and if I am tedious I hope you will pardon me; for, to draw you out of the Labyrinth into which you have run your ſelf, I am forc'd on that Prolixity. You call me Friend, yet, what is abſoluetly inconſiſtent with Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, you would rob me of my Honour; Nay, you ſtop not here, but would oblige me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy yours. Firſt, that you would rob me of mine is evident; for what will <hi>Camilla</hi> think when I make a Declaration of Love to her, but that I am a perfidious Villain, that make no ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of violating the moſt ſacred Laws of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and who ſacrifice the Honour and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my Friend to a Criminal Paſſion? Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that I deſtroy yours is as evident; for when ſhe ſees me take ſuch a Liberty with her, ſhe will imagine that I have diſcover'd ſome Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in her that has given me aſſurance to make her ſo guilty a Diſcovery, by which ſhe eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelf injur'd in her Honour, you being the principal part of her, muſt of neceſſity be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the Affronts ſhe receives. For this is the Reaſon why the Husband, though never ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, cautious, and careful, ſuffers the Infamy of a ſcandalous Name if his Wife goes aſtray;
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:54446:228"/>
whereas in Reaſon he ought rather to be an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Compaſſion than Contempt, ſeeing the Misfortune proceeds from the Vice and Folly of his Wife, not his own Defects. But ſince the Reaſon and Juſtice of the Man's Suffering for his Wife's Tranſgreſſion, may be ſerviceable to you, I'll give you the beſt account of it I can; and pray do not think me tedious, ſince this is meant for your good. When Woman was given to Man, and Marriage firſt Ordain'd in Paradiſe, Man and Wife were made and pronounc'd <hi>one Fleſh;</hi> the Husband therefore being of a piece with the Wife, whatever affects her affects him, as a part of her; tho', as I have ſaid, he has been no Occaſion of it: For as the whole Body is affected by the pain of any part, as the Head will ſhare the pain of the Foot, tho' it never caus'd that Pain, ſo is the Husband touch'd with his Wife's Infamy, becauſe ſhe is a part of him. And ſince all Worldly Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours and Diſhonours are deriv'd from Fleſh and Blood, and the ſcandalous Baſeneſs of an unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Wife proceeds from the ſame Principle, it neceſſarily follows that the Husband, tho' no Party in the Offence, and intirely ignorant, and innocent of it, muſt have his ſhare of the Infamy. Let what I have ſaid, my dear <hi>Anſelmo,</hi> make you ſenſible of the Danger into which you wou'd run, by endeavouring thus to diſturb the happy Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility and Repoſe that your Wife at preſent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys; and for how vain a Curioſity, and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant a Caprice, you would rouſe, and awake thoſe peccant Humours which are now lull'd aſleep by the Power of an unattempted Chaſtity. Reflect farther, how ſmall a Return you can expect from ſo hazardous a Voyage, and ſuch valuable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities as you venture; for the Treaſure you will loſe is ſo great, and ought to be ſo dear, that
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:54446:229"/>
all Words are too inexpreſſive to ſhew how much you ought to eſteem it. But if all I have ſaid be too weak to deſtroy your fooliſh Reſolve, imploy ſome other Inſtrument of your Diſgrace and Ruin; for, tho' I ſhould loſe your Friendſhip, a Loſs which I muſt eſteem the greateſt in the World, I will have no hand in an Affair ſo prejudicial to your Honour.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Lothario</hi> ſaid no more, and <hi>Anſelmo</hi> diſcovering a deſponding Melancholy in his Face, remain'd a great while ſilent and confounded. At laſt, I have, ſaid he, my Friend, liſten'd to your Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, as you might obſerve, with all the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in Nature, and every part of what you have ſaid convinces me of the greatneſs of your Wiſdom and Friendſhip; and I muſt own, that, if I ſuffer my Deſires to prevail over your Reaſons, I ſhun the Good and purſue the Evil. But yet, my Friend, you ought, on the other ſide, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, that my Diſtemper is not much unlike that of thoſe Women who ſometimes long for Coals, Lime, nay, ſome things that are loathſome to the very ſight; and therefore ſome little Arts ſhould be us'd to endeavour my Cure, which might eaſily be affected if you would but conſent to ſollicit <hi>Camilla,</hi> though it were but weakly and remiſly; for I am ſure ſhe will not be ſo frail to ſurrender at the firſt Aſſault, which yet will be ſufficient to give me the ſatisfaction I deſire: And in this you will fulfil the Duty of our Friendſhip, in reſtoring me to Life, and ſecuring my Honour by your powerful and perſwaſive Reaſons. And you are indeed bound as my Friend to do thus much to ſecure me from betraying my. Defects and Follies to a Stranger, which would certainly ſhock their Reputation, which you have taken ſo much pains to preſerve; ſince I am ſo bent on this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:54446:229"/>
that if you refuſe me, I ſhall certainly apply my ſelf elſewhere: And though a while your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation may ſuffer in <hi>Camilla</hi>'s Opinion, yet when ſhe has once prov'd Triumphant, you may cure that Wound, and recover her good Opinion by a ſincere diſcovery of your Deſign. Wherefore I conjure you to comply with my Importunity, in ſpight of all the Obſtacles that may preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to you, ſince what I deſire is ſo little, and the Pleaſure I ſhall derive from it ſo great: For as I have promis'd, your very firſt Attempt ſhall ſatisfy me as much as if you had gone through the whole Experiment.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Lothario</hi> plainly ſaw that <hi>Anſelmo</hi>'s Reſolution was too much fix'd for any thing he could ſay to alter it, and finding that he threaten'd to betray his Folly to a Stranger if he perſiſted in a Refuſal, to avoid greater inconveniencies, he reſolv'd to ſeem to comply with his Deſires; privately deſigning to ſatisfie <hi>Anſelmo</hi>'s Caprice, without giving <hi>Camilla</hi> any trouble, and therefore he deſir'd him to break the Matter to no body elſe, ſince he would himſelf undertake it, and begin as ſoon as he pleas'd. <hi>Anſelmo</hi> embrac'd him with all the Love and Tenderneſs imaginable, and was as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal of his Thanks as if the very Promiſe had been the greateſt Obligation that could be laid on him. They immediately agreed on the next Day for the Trial, at which time <hi>Anſelmo</hi> ſhould give him the Opportunity of being alone with her, and Gold and Jewels to preſent her with. He advis'd him to omit no Point of Gallantry, as Serenades, and Songs, and Verſes in her Praiſe; offering to make 'em himſelf, if <hi>Lothario</hi> would not be at the trouble. But <hi>Lothario</hi> promis'd him to do all himſelf, tho' his deſign was far different from <hi>Anſelmo</hi>'s.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="410" facs="tcp:54446:230"/>Matters being thus adjuſted, they return'd to <hi>Anſelmo</hi>'s Houſe, where they found the Beautiful <hi>Camilla,</hi> ſad with Concern for the abſence of her Husband beyond his uſual bout. <hi>Lothario</hi> left him there, and retir'd home, as penſive how to come off handſomely in this Ridiculous Affair, as he had left <hi>Anſelmo</hi> pleas'd and contented with his undertaking it. But that Night, he contriv'd a way of impoſing on <hi>Anſelmo</hi> to his Satisfaction, without offending <hi>Camilla.</hi> So next day he goes to <hi>Anſelmo</hi>'s, and was receiv'd by <hi>Camilla</hi> with a Civility and Reſpect anſwerable to the uncommon Friendſhip ſhe knew was between him and her Husband. Dinner being over, <hi>Anſelmo</hi> deſir'd his Friend to keep his Lady Company till his return from an extraordinary Affair, that would require his Abſence about an hour and half. <hi>Camilla</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd him not to go; <hi>Lothario</hi> offer'd to go with him; but he pleaded peculiar Buſineſs, intreated his Friend to ſtay, and enjoyn'd his Wife not to leave him alone till his return; and ſo he left them together, without any one to obſerve their Actions, all the Servants being retir'd to Dinner.</p>
                           <p>Thus <hi>Lothario</hi> found himſelf enter'd the Liſts, his Adverſary before him, terribly arm'd with a thouſand piercing Beauties, ſufficient to overcome all the Men ſhe ſhould Encounter, which gave him cauſe enough to fear his own Fate. The firſt thing he did in this firſt Onſet, was to lean his Head careleſly on his Hand, and beg her leave to take a Nap in his Chair till his Friend came back: <hi>Camilla</hi> told him ſhe thought he might reſt with more eaſe on the Couch in the next Room; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd himſelf ſatisfi'd with the Place where he was, and ſo ſlept till his Friend came back. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelmo</hi> finding his Wife in her Chamber, and <hi>Lothario</hi> aſleep at his return, concluded that he had given
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:54446:230"/>
them time enough both for Diſcourſe, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and therefore waited with a great deal of impatience for his Friend's awaking, that they might retire and he might acquaint him with his ſucceſs. <hi>Lothario</hi> at laſt awak'd, and going out with his Friend, he anſwer'd his Enquiry to this purpoſe, That he did not think it convenient to proceed farther at that time than ſome general Praiſe of her Wit and Beauty, which would beſt prepare his way for what he might do hereafter; and diſpoſe her to give a more eaſie and willing Ear to what he ſhould ſay to her: As the Devil, by laying a pleaſing and apparent Good at firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, inſinuates himſelf into our Inclinations; ſo that he generally gains his Point before we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Cloven-Foot, if his Diſguiſe paſs on us in the beignning. <hi>Anſelmo</hi> was extreamly ſatisfi'd with what <hi>Lothario</hi> ſaid, and promis'd him every day as good an Opportunity; and tho' he could not go every Day abroad, yet he would manage his Conduct ſo well, that <hi>Camilla</hi> ſhould have no cauſe of Suſpicion. He took care to do as he ſaid. But <hi>Lothario</hi> wilfully loſt the frequent Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he gave him; however, he ſooth'd him ſtill with Aſſurances, that his Lady was inflexible, her Virtue not to be ſurmounted, and that ſhe had threaten'd to diſcover his Attempts to her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, if he ever preſum'd to be ſo Inſolent again; ſo far was ſhe from giving him the leaſt Hope or Encouragement. Thus far 'tis well, ſaid <hi>Anſelmo,</hi> but yet <hi>Camilla</hi> has reſiſted nothing but Words, we muſt now ſee what Proof ſhe is againſt more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Temptations. To morrow I will furniſh you with two thouſand Crowns in Gold to preſent her with, and as a farther Bait you ſhall have as much more in Jewels. For Women, eſpecially if they are handſom, naturally love to go gaily and
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:54446:231"/>
richly dreſt, be they never ſo chaſte and virtuous; and if ſhe have power to overcome this Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, I'll give you no farther Trouble. Since I have begun this Adventure, reply'd <hi>Lothario,</hi> I will make an end of it; tho' I am ſure her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes will tire out my Patience, and her Virtue overcome any Temptation, and baffle my Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.</p>
                           <p>The next Day <hi>Anſelmo</hi> deliver'd him the four thouſand Crowns, and with them as many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing Thoughts, not knowing how to ſupply his Invention with ſome new Story to amuſe his Friend. However, at laſt he reſolv'd to return the Money, with Aſſurance that <hi>Camilla</hi> was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd with Preſents, as with Praiſe, and as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch'd with Promiſes, as with Vows and ſighs of Love; and therefore all farther Attempts wou'd be but a fruitleſs Labour. This was his Intention; but Fortune that medl'd too much in theſe Affairs diſappointed his Deſigns. For <hi>Anſelmo</hi> having left him alone with his Wife one day as he us'd to do; privately convey'd himſelf into the Cloſet, and thro' the Chinks of the Door ſet himſelf to obſerve what they did; he found that for one half hour <hi>Lothario</hi> ſaid not one word to <hi>Camilla,</hi> from whence he conluded that all the Addreſſes, Importunities, and Repulſes with which he had amus'd him, were pure Fictions. But, that he might be fully ſatisfi'd in the truth of his Surmiſe, coming from his Covert he took his Friend aſide, and enquir'd of him what <hi>Camilla</hi> had then ſaid to him, and how he now found her enclin'd? <hi>Lothario</hi> reply'd, that he would make no farther trial of her, ſince her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer had now been ſo ſevere and awful, that he durſt not for the future venture upon a Diſcourſe ſo evidently her Averſion.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="413" facs="tcp:54446:231"/>Ah! <hi>Lothario! Lothario!</hi> cry'd <hi>Anſelmo,</hi> is it thus that you keep your Promiſes? Is this what I ſhou'd expect from your Friendſhip? I obſerv'd you through that door, and found that you ſaid not a Word to <hi>Camilla;</hi> and from thence I am very well ſatisfied, that you have only impos'd on me all the Anſwers and Relations you have made me. Why did you hinder me from employing ſome other, if you never intended to ſatisfie my Deſire? <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelmo</hi> ſaid no more, but this was enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found <hi>Lothario,</hi> and cover him with Shame for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found in a Lie. Therefore, to appeaſe his Friend, he ſwore to him from that time forward to ſet in good Earneſt about the Matter, and that ſo effectually, that he himſelf if he wou'd again give himſelf the trouble of obſerving him, ſhould find proof enough of his Sincerity. <hi>Anſelmo</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd him; and to give him the better opportunity, he engag'd a Friend of his to ſend for him with a great deal of Importunity to come to his Houſe at a Village near the City, where he meant to ſpend eight Days, to take away all Apprehenſion and Fear from both his Friend and his Wife.</p>
                           <p>Was ever Man ſo unhappy as <hi>Anſelmo,</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly contriv'd the Plot of his own Ruine and Diſhonour! He had a very good Wife, and poſſeſs'd her in Quiet, without any other Man's mingling in his Pleaſures; her Thoughts were bounded with her own Houſe, and her Husband, the only Earthly Good ſhe hop'd or thought on, and her only Pleaſure, and Deſire; his Will the Rule of her's and meaſure of her Conduct. When he poſſeſs'd Love, Honour, Beauty, and Diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without Pain or Toil, what ſhou'd provoke him to ſeek with ſo much danger, and hazard of what he had already, that which was not to be found in Nature! He that aims at things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:54446:232"/>
ought juſtly to loſe thoſe Advantages which are within the Bounds of Poſſibility, as the Poet ſings.</p>

                           <p>The next Day <hi>Anſelmo</hi> went out of Town; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt inform'd <hi>Camilla,</hi> that his Friend <hi>Lothario</hi> would look after his Affairs, and keep her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in his Abſence, and deſir'd her to make as much of him as of himſelf. His Lady like a diſcreet Women, begg'd him to conſider how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper a thing it was for any other to take his Place in his Abſence; and told him, that if he doubted her Ability in managing her Houſe, he ſhould try her but this time, and ſhe queſtion'd not but he would find ſhe had Capacity to acquit her ſelf to his ſatisfaction in greater Matters. <hi>Anſelmo</hi> reply'd that it was her Duty not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute but obey his Command: To which ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd, that ſhe would comply, tho' much againſt her Will. In ſhort, her Husband left the Town: <hi>Lothario</hi> the next Day was receiv'd at her Houſe with all the reſpect that could be paid a Friend ſo dear to her Husband; but yet with ſo much
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:54446:232"/>
Caution, that ſhe never permitted her ſelf to be left alone with him, but kept perpetually ſome of her Maids in the Room, and chiefly <hi>Leonela,</hi> for whom ſhe had a particular Love, as having been bred in her Father's Houſe with her from her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Lothario</hi> ſaid nothing to her the three firſt Days, notwithſtanding he might have found an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity when the Servants were gone to Dinner; for tho' the prudent <hi>Camilla</hi> had order'd <hi>Leonela</hi> to dine before her, that ſhe might have no occaſion to go out of the Room; yet ſhe who had other Affairs to employ her thoughts more agreeably to her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations (to gratify which, that was uſually the only convenient time ſhe could find) was not ſo very punctually obedient to her Lady's Commands, but that ſhe ſometimes left them together. <hi>Lothario</hi> did not yet make uſe of theſe advantages, as I have ſaid, being aw'd by the Virtue and Modeſty of <hi>Camilla.</hi> But this ſilence which ſhe thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd on <hi>Lothario,</hi> had at laſt a quite contrary Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. For, tho' he ſaid nothing, his Thoughts were active, his Eyes were employed to ſee and ſurvey the outward Charms of a Form ſo perfect, that 'twas enough to fire the moſt cold, and ſoften the moſt obdurate Heart. In theſe Intervals of ſilence, he conſider'd how much ſhe deſerv'd to be belov'd, and theſe Conſiderations by little and little undermin'd and aſſaulted the Faith which he ow'd to his Friend. A thouſand times he reſolv'd to leave the City and retire where <hi>Anſelmo</hi> ſhould never ſee him, and where he ſhou'd never more behold the dangerous Face of <hi>Camilla;</hi> but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Pleaſure he found in ſeeing her, ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd ſo feeble a Reſolve. When he was alone, he wou'd accuſe his want of Friendſhip and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and run into frequent Compariſons betwixt
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:54446:233"/>
himſelf and <hi>Anſelmo,</hi> which generally concluded that <hi>Anſelmo</hi>'s Folly and Madneſs was greater than hit Infidelity; and that, wou'd Heaven as eaſily excuſe his Intentions, as Man, he had no cauſe to fear any Puniſhment for the Crime he was going to commit. In fine, <hi>Camilla</hi>'s Beauty, and the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity given him by the Husband himſelf, wholly vanquiſh'd his Faith and Friendſhip. And now having an Eye only to the means of obtaining that Pleaſure, to which he was prompted with ſo much Violence; after he had ſpent the three firſt Days of <hi>Anſelmo</hi>'s Abſence in a conflict betwixt Love and Virtue, he attempted by all means poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to prevail with <hi>Camilla;</hi> and diſcover'd ſo much Paſſion in his Words and Actions, that <hi>Camilla</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd with the unexpected Aſſault, flung from him out of the Room and retir'd with haſte to her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Hope is always born with Love, nor did this Repulſe in the leaſt diſcourage <hi>Lothario</hi> from farther Attempts on <hi>Camilla,</hi> who by this appear'd more charming, and more worthy his Purſuit. She on the other hand, knew not what to do upon the diſcovery of that in <hi>Lothario,</hi> which ſhe never cou'd have imagin'd. The Reſult of her Reflections was this, that ſince ſhe cou'd not give him any oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſpeaking to her again, without the hazard of her Reputation and Honour, ſhe wou'd ſend a Letter to her Husband to ſollicit his Return to his Houſe. The Letter ſhe ſent by a Meſſenger that very Night, and it was to this purpoſe.</p>

                           <p>
                              <hi>AS 'tis very improper to leave an Army without a General, and a Garriſon without a Governour, ſo to me it ſeems much more imprudent to leave a young marry'd Woman without her Husband, eſpecially when there are no Affairs of Conſequence to plead for his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. I find my ſelf ſo all in your's, and ſo impatient, and unable to endure it any longer, that if you come not home very quickly I ſhall be oblig'd to return to my Father's, tho' I leave your Houſe without any one to look after it: For the Perſon to whom you have entruſted the Care of your Family, has I believe more Regard to his own Pleaſure than your Concerns. You are wiſe and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and therefore I ſhall ſay no more, nor is it conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent I ſhou'd.</hi>

                              <hi>Anſelmo</hi> was not a little ſatisfy'd at the Receipt of this Letter, which aſſur'd him that <hi>Lothario</hi> had begun the Attempt, which ſhe had repell'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Hopes; and therefore he ſent her Word not to leave his Houſe, aſſuring her it ſhou'd not be long before he return'd. <hi>Camilla</hi> was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd with his Anſwer, and more perplex'd than before, being equally affraid of going to her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and of ſtaying at home; in the Firſt ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey'd her Husband, in the Latter ran the Riſque of her Honour. The worſt Reſolution prevail'd, which was to ſtay at her own Houſe, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:54446:234"/>
                              <hi>Lothario</hi>'s Company, leaſt it ſhou'd give ſome Cauſe of Suſpicion to her Servants. And now ſhe repented her writing to <hi>Anſelmo,</hi> leaſt he ſhou'd ſuſpect that <hi>Lothario</hi> had obſerv'd ſome Indiſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in her, that made him loſe the Reſpect due to her, and gave him Aſſurance to offer at the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting her Honeſty: But confiding in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and her own Innocence, which ſhe thought Proof againſt all <hi>Lothario</hi>'s Attempts, ſhe reſolv'd to make no Anſwer to whatever he ſhou'd ſay to her, and never more to trouble her Husband with Complaints, for Fear of engaging him in Diſputes and Quarrels with his Friend. For that Reaſon ſhe conſider'd how ſhe might beſt excuſe him to <hi>Anſelmo,</hi> when he ſhou'd examine the Cauſe of her writing to him in that Manner. With a Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo innocent and dangerous, the next Day ſhe gave Ear to all that <hi>Lothario</hi> ſaid; and he gave the Aſſault with ſuch Force and Vigour, that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milla</hi>'s Conſtancy cou'd not ſtand the Shock un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd, and her Virtue cou'd do no more than guard her Eyes from betraying that tender Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, of which his Vows and Entreaties, and all his Sighs and Tears had made her Heart ſenſible. <hi>Lothario</hi> diſcover'd this with an infinite Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and no leſs Addition to his Flame; and found that he ought to make uſe of this Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of <hi>Anſelmo</hi>'s Abſence, with all his Force and Importunity to win ſo valuable a Fortreſs. He began with the powerful Battery of the Praiſe of her Beauty, which being directly pointed on the weakeſt Part of Woman, her Vanity, with the greateſt Eaſe and Facility in the World makes a Breach as great as a Lover wou'd deſire. <hi>Lothario</hi> was not unskilful or remiſs in the Attack, but follow'd his Fire ſo cloſe, that let <hi>Camilla</hi>'s Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity be built on never ſo obdurate a Rock, it muſt
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:54446:234"/>
at laſt have fall'n. He wept, pray'd, flatter'd, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd, ſwore, vow'd, and ſhew'd ſo much Paſſion and Truth in what he ſaid, that bearing down the Care of her Honour, he at laſt triumph'd over what he ſcarce durſt hope, tho' what he moſt of all deſir'd; for ſhe at laſt ſurrender'd, even <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milla</hi> ſurrender'd. Nor ought we to wonder if ſhe yielded, ſince even <hi>Lothario</hi>'s Friendſhip and Virtue were not able to withſtand the terrible Aſſault; an evident Proof that Love is a Power too ſtrong to be overcome by any thing but fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that no mortal Creature ought to be ſo preſumptuous as to ſtand the Encounter, ſince there is Need of ſomething more than human, and indeed a heavenly Force, to confront and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh that human Paſſion. <hi>Leonela</hi> was the only Confident of this Amour, which theſe new Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and faithleſs Friends could not by any Means conceal from her Knowledge. <hi>Lothario</hi> would not diſcover to <hi>Camilla,</hi> that her Husband for her Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al had deſignedly given him this Opportunity, to which he ow'd ſo extreme a Happineſs; becauſe ſhe ſhou'd not think he wanted Love to ſollicit her himſelf with Importunity, or that ſhe was gain'd on too eaſy Terms.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſelmo</hi> came home in a few Days, but diſcover'd not what he had loſt, tho' it was what he moſt valu'd and eſteem'd: From thence he went to <hi>Lothario,</hi> and embracing him, begg'd of him to let him know his Fate. All I can tell you, my Friend, anſwer'd <hi>Lothario,</hi> is, that you may boaſt your ſelf the Husband of the beſt Wife in the World, the Ornament of her Sex, and the Pattern which all virtuous Women ought to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Words, Offers, Preſents, all is ineffectual; the Tears I pretended to ſhed, mov'd only her Laughter. <hi>Camilla</hi> is not only Miſtreſs of the
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:54446:235"/>
greateſt Beauty, but of Modeſty, Diſcretion, Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Temper, and every other Virtue and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection that add to the Charms of a Woman of Honour. Therefore, my Friend, here take back your Money, I have had no Occaſion to lay it out, for <hi>Camilla</hi>'s Integrity cannot be corrupted by ſuch baſe and mercenary things as Gifts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. And now <hi>Anſelmo</hi> be at laſt content with the Trial you have already made, and having ſo luckily got over the dangerous Quick-ſands of Doubts and Suſpicions that are to be met with in the Ocean of Matrimony, do not venture out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with another Pilot that Veſſel whoſe Strength you have ſufficiently experienc'd; but believe your ſelf as you are, ſecurely anchor'd in a ſafe Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, at Pleaſure and Eaſe, till Death, from whoſe Force no Title, Power, nor Dignity can ſecure us, does come and cut the Cable. <hi>Anſelmo</hi> was extremely ſatisfy'd with <hi>Lothario</hi>'s Diſcourſe, and believ'd it as firmly as if it had been an Oracle; yet deſir'd him to continue his Purſuit, if it were but to paſs away the Time: He did not require he ſhould preſs <hi>Camilla</hi> with thoſe Importunities he had us'd, but only make ſome Verſes in her Praiſe under the Name of <hi>Cloris,</hi> and he would make <hi>Camilla</hi> believe he celebrated a Lady he lov'd under that Name, to ſecure her Honour and Reputation from the Cenſure which a more open Declaration would incur: He added, that if <hi>Lothario</hi> would not be at the Expence of ſo much Trouble and Time as to compoſe them himſelf, he would do it for him with a great deal of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. <hi>Lothario</hi> told him there was no Need of that, ſince he himſelf was ſometimes poetically given; do you but tell <hi>Camilla</hi> of my Love according to your own Deſign, and I'll make the Verſes as well as I can, tho' not ſo well as the Excellency of the
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:54446:235"/>
Subject requires. The <hi>Curious Impertinent</hi> and his treacherous Friend having thus agreed the Matter, <hi>Anſelmo</hi> went home, and then ask'd <hi>Camilla</hi> on what Occaſion ſhe ſent him the Letter? <hi>Camilla,</hi> who wonder'd that this Queſtion had not been ask'd her before, reply'd, That the Motive that prevail'd with her to write in that Manner to him, was a Jealouſy ſhe had entertain'd that <hi>Lothario</hi> in his Abſence look'd on her with more criminal and deſiring Eyes than he us'd to do when he was at home; but that ſince ſhe had Reaſon to believe that Suſpicion but weakly grounded, ſeeing he diſcover'd rather an Averſion than Love, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding all Occaſions of being alone with her. <hi>Anſelmo</hi> told her ſhe had nothing to apprehend from <hi>Lothario</hi> on that Account, ſince he knew his Affections engag'd on one of the nobleſt young Ladies of the City, whoſe Praiſe he writ under the Name of <hi>Cloris;</hi> but were he not thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd, there was no Reaſon to ſuſpect <hi>Lothario</hi>'s Virtue and Friendſhip. <hi>Camilla</hi> at this Diſcourſe, without Doubt, would have been very jealous of <hi>Lothario,</hi> had he not told her his Deſign of abuſing her Husband with the Pretence of another Love, that he might with the greater Liberty and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity expreſs her Praiſe and his Paſſion. The next Day at Dinner <hi>Anſelmo</hi> deſir'd him to read ſome of the Verſes he had made on his beloved <hi>Cloris,</hi> telling him he might ſay any thing of her before <hi>Camilla,</hi> ſince ſhe did not know who the Lady was. Did <hi>Camilla</hi> know her, reply'd <hi>Lothario,</hi> that ſhould not make me paſs over in Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence my Part of that Praiſe which was her Due; or if a Lover complains of his Miſtreſs's Cruelty while he is praiſing her Perfections, ſhe can never ſuffer in her Reputation: Therefore without any

new Fuel to that Fire that was to conſume his Reputation.

Madam, return'd <hi>Leonela,</hi> let not that diſquiet you; for the ſpeedy beſtowing a Benefit of an intrinſick Value, and which you deſign to beſtow at laſt, can never leſſen the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; for according to the old Proverb, <hi>He that gives quickly gives twice.</hi> To anſwer your Proverb with another, reply'd <hi>Camilla,</hi> That which <hi>coſts little is leſs valu'd.</hi> But this has nothing to do with you, anſwer'd <hi>Leonela,</hi> ſince 'tis ſaid of Love that it ſometimes goes, ſometimes flies; runs with one, walks gravely with another; turns a third into Ice, and ſets a fourth in a Flame: It wounds one, another it kills; like Lightning it begins and ends in the ſame Moment: It makes that Fort yield at Night which it beſieg'd but in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for there is no Force able to reſiſt it. Since this is evident, what Cauſe have you to be ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at your own Frailty? And why ſhould you apprehend any thing from <hi>Lothario,</hi> who has felt
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:54446:237"/>
the ſame irreſiſtible Power, and yielded to it as ſoon? For Love, to gain a Conqueſt, took the ſhort Opportunity of my Lord's Abſence, which being ſo ſhort and uncertain, Love, that had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore determin'd this ſhou'd be done, added Force and Vigour to the Lover, not to leave any thing to Time and Chance, which might by <hi>Anſelmo</hi>'s Return cut off all Opportunities of accompliſhing ſo agreeable a Work. The beſt and moſt offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Servant of Love's Retinue, is Occaſion or Opportunity: This it is that Love improves in all its Progreſs, but moſt in the Beginning and firſt Riſe of an Amour. I truſt not in what I have ſaid to the Uncertainty of Report, but to Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, which affords the moſt certain and moſt valuable Knowledge, as I will inform you, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſome Day or other; for I am like you, made of frail Fleſh and Blood, fir'd by Youth and youthful Deſires. But, Madam, you did not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render to <hi>Lothario</hi> till you had ſufficient Proof of his Love from his Eyes, his Vows, his Promiſes, and Gifts; till you had ſeen the Merit of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and the Beauty of his Mind; all which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd you how much he deſerv'd to be lov'd. Then trouble your ſelf no more, Madam, with theſe Fears and Jealouſies, but thank your Stars that, ſince you were doom'd a Victim to Love, you fell by the Force of ſuch Valour and Merit that cannot be doubted. You yielded to one who has not only the four S's, which are requir'd in every good Lover, but even the whole <hi>Alphabet;</hi> as for Example, he is in my Opinion <hi>Agreeable, Bountiful, Conſtant, Dutiful, Eaſy, Faithful, Gallant, Honourable, Ingenious, Kind, Loyal, Mild, Noble, Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, Prudent, Quiet, Rich, Secret, True, Valiant, Wiſe,</hi> the <hi>X</hi> indeed is too harſh a Letter to agree with him, he is <hi>Young,</hi> and <hi>Zealous</hi> for your Honour and
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:54446:238"/>
Service. <hi>Camilla</hi> laugh'd at her Woman's <hi>Alphabet,</hi> and thought her (as indeed ſhe was) more learn'd in the practical Part of Love than ſhe had confeſs'd, She then inform'd her Miſtreſs of an Affair that had been betwixt her and a young Man of the Town. <hi>Camilla</hi> was not a little concern'd at what ſhe ſaid, being apprehenſive that her Honour might ſuffer by her Woman's Indiſcretion, and therefore ask'd her if the Amour had paſs'd any farther than Words? <hi>Leonela,</hi> without any Fear or Shame, own'd her guilty Correſpondence with all the Freedom in the World; for the Miſtreſs's Guilt gives the Servant Impudence, and generally they imitate their Ladies Frailties without any Fear of the publick Cenſure.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Camilla</hi> finding her Error paſt Remedy, could only beg <hi>Leonela</hi> to diſcloſe nothing of her Affair to her Lover, and manage her Amour with Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſy and Diſcretion, for fear <hi>Lothario</hi> or <hi>Anſelmo</hi> ſhould hear of it. <hi>Leonela</hi> promis'd to obey her. but ſhe did it in ſuch a Manner, that <hi>Camilla</hi> was perpetually in fear of the Loſs of her Reputation by her Folly; for ſhe grew ſo confident on her Knowledge of her Lady's Tranſgreſſion, that ſhe admitted her Gallant into the Houſe, not caring if her Lady knew it, being certain that ſhe durſt not make any Diſcovery to her Maſter: For when once a Miſtreſs has ſuffer'd her Virtue to be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd, and admits of any criminal Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, it ſubjects her to her own Servants, and makes her ſubſervient to their Rogueries, which ſhe is ſlaviſhly bound to conceal. Thus it was with <hi>Camilla,</hi> who was forc'd to wink at the viſible Rendezvous which <hi>Leonela</hi> had with her Lover in a certain Chamber of the Houſe which ſhe thought proper for the Occaſion; nor was that all, ſhe
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:54446:238"/>
was conſtrain'd to give her the opportunity of hiding him, by blinding her Husband.</p>
                           <p>But all this Caution did not ſecure him from being ſeen by <hi>Lothario,</hi> one Morning as he was getting out of the Houſe by break of Day. His Surprize had made him think it a Spirit, had not his Haſte away, and his muffling himſelf up in his Cloak, that he might not be known, convinc'd him of his Error, and thrown him into a new Jealouſie, that had certainly undone them all, had not <hi>Camilla</hi>'s Wit and Addreſs prevented it. For <hi>Lothario</hi> concluded that <hi>Camilla,</hi> that had made no very obſtinate Reſiſtance to him, had as eaſily ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render'd to ſome other, and he fancy'd that the Perſon he ſaw come from her Houſe was the new-favour'd Lover; never remembring that there was any ſuch Perſon as <hi>Leonela</hi> in the Houſe. For when once a Woman parts with her Virtue, ſhe loſes the Eſteem even of the Man whoſe Vows and Tears won her to abandon it; and he believes ſhe will with as little, if not leſs Difficulty, yield to another; he perverts the leaſt Suſpicions into Reality, and takes the lighteſt Appearance for the moſt evident Matter of Fact.</p>
                           <p>Thus <hi>Lothario</hi> diſtracted by the moſt violent Jealouſie in the World, without allowing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf time to conſider, gave way to the Tranſports of his Rage and deſire of Revenge on <hi>Camilla,</hi> who had not injur'd him; he goes immediately to <hi>Anſelmo,</hi> and having found him abed, I have, my Friend, ſaid he to him, theſe ſeveral Days under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone a moſt ſevere Conflict within my Mind, and us'd all the Force and Violence I was capable of to conceal an Affair from you, which I can no longer forbear diſcovering, without an apparent Wrong to Juſtice, and my Friendſhip. Know then that <hi>Camilla</hi> is now ready to do whatſoever I
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:54446:239"/>
ſhall deſire of her, and the Reaſon that moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd with me to delay this Diſcovery, was, that I would be ſatisfy'd whether ſhe were in earneſt, or only pretended this Compliance to try me; but had ſhe been ſo Virtuous as you and I believ'd her, ſhe would by this time have inform'd you of that Importunity which by your Deſire I us'd; but finding that ſhe is ſilent, and takes no notice of that to you, I have reaſon to believe that ſhe is but too ſincere in thoſe guilty Promiſes ſhe has made me, of meeting me to my Satisfaction in the Wardrobe the next time your Abſence from the Town ſhould furniſh her with an Opportunity. (This was true indeed, for that was the Place of their common Rendezvous) Yet I would not have you, continu'd he, take a raſh and inconſiderate Revenge, ſince 'tis poſſible before the time of Aſſignation her Virtue may Rally, and ſhe repent her Folly. Therefore, as you have hitherto taken my Advice, be rul'd by me now, that you may not be impos'd on, but have a ſufficient Conviction before you put your Reſolves into Execution; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend two or three Days Abſence, and then privately convey your ſelf behind the Hangings in the Wardrobe, as you eaſily may, whence you may without difficulty be an Eye Witneſs with me of <hi>Camilla</hi>'s Conduct; and if it be as Criminal as we may juſtly fear, then you may with ſecrecy and ſpeed puniſh her, as the Injury deſerves.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſelmo</hi> was extremely ſurpriz'd at ſo unexpected a Misfortune, to find himſelf deceiv'd in thoſe imaginary Tiumphs he pleas'd himſelf with in <hi>Camilla</hi>'s ſuppos'd Victory over all <hi>Lothario</hi>'s Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults. A great while he was in a ſilent ſuſpence, with his Eyes dejected, without Force, and without Spirit; but turning at laſt to his Friend, you have done all, ſaid he, <hi>Lothario,</hi> that I could
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:54446:239"/>
expect from ſo perfect a Friendſhip, I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be entirely guided by your Advice; do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what you pleaſe, but uſe all the ſecreſy a Thing of this Nature requires. <hi>Lothario,</hi> aſſuring him of that, left him; but full of Repentance for the Raſhneſs he had been guilty of in telling him ſo much as he had, ſince he might have taken a ſufficient Revenge by a leſs cruel, and diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able way. He curs'd his want of Senſe, and the weakneſs of his Reſolution, but could not find out any way to produce a leſs fatal event of his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, than he could juſtly expect from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment. But at laſt he concluded to inform <hi>Camilla</hi> of all he had done; which his Freedom of Acceſs gave him opportunity to do that very day, when he found her alone; and ſhe began thus to him. I am ſo oppreſs'd my <hi>Lothario,</hi> with a Misfortune which I lie under, that it will certainly for ever deſtroy my Quiet and Happineſs, if there be not ſome ſpeedy Remedy found for it: <hi>Leonela</hi> is grown ſo preſumptuous, on her knowledge of my Affairs, that ſhe admits her Lover all Night to her Chamber, and ſo expoſes my Reputation to the Cenſure of any that ſhall ſee him go out at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable Hours from my Houſe; and the greateſt, and moſt remedileſs part of my grief is, that I dare not correct or chide her for her Imprudence and Impudence; for being conſcious of our Correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence, ſhe obliges me to conceal her Failings, which I am extremely apprehenſive will in the end be very fatal to my Happineſs. <hi>Lothario</hi> was at laſt jealous that <hi>Camilla</hi> deſign'd cunningly thus to impoſe her own Privado on him for <hi>Leonela</hi>'s; but being convinc'd by her Tears, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Concern in her Face, he began to believe her, and at the ſame time to be infinitely confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and griev'd for what he had done. Yet he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:54446:240"/>
                              <hi>Camilla,</hi> aſſuring her he would take ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Care for the future, that <hi>Leonela</hi>'s Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhould do her no Prejudice, and therefore begg'd her not to torment her ſelf any more about it. Then he told all the unhappy Effect of his Jealous Rage, and that her Husband had agreed behind the Arras to be witneſs of her Weakneſs. He ask'd her Pardon for the Folly, and her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel how to redreſs and prevent the ill Effect of it, and bring them out of thoſe Difficulties into which his Madneſs had plung'd them.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Camilla</hi> expreſs'd her Reſentment; and her Fears, in accuſing his Treachey, Baſeneſs, and want of Conſideration; yet her Anger and Fears being appeas'd, and a Woman's wit being always more pregnant in Difficulties than a Man's, ſhe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately thought of a way to deliver them from Dangers that bore ſo diſmal and helpleſs a Face. She therefore bid him engage <hi>Anſelmo</hi> to be there the next Day, aſſuring him ſhe did not queſtion but by that means to get a more frequent, and ſecure Opportunity of enjoying one another than they hitherto ever had. She would not make him privy to her whole Deſign, but bid him be ſure to come after her Husband was hid, as ſoon as <hi>Leonela</hi> ſhou'd call him, and that he ſhould anſwer as directly to whatſoever ſhe ſhould ask him, as if <hi>Anſelmo</hi> were not within hearing. <hi>Lothario</hi> ſpar'd no Importunity to get from her her whole De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, that he might Act his Part with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Aſſurance, and the better contribute to the Impoſing on her Husband. All you have to do, reply'd <hi>Camilla,</hi> is to anſwer me directly what I ſhall demand; nor would ſhe diſcover any more, for fear he ſhould not acquieſce in her Opinion, which ſhe was ſo well ſatisfy'd in, but raiſe Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, and by Conſequence Obſtacles, that might
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:54446:240"/>
hinder her Deſign from having the deſir'd Event, or run her upon ſome leſs ſucceſsful Project. <hi>Lothario</hi> comply'd, and <hi>Anſelmo</hi> in appearance left the Town to retire to his Friend in the Country, but ſecretly return'd to hide himſelf in the Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe, which he did with the greater Eaſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Camilla</hi> and <hi>Leonela</hi> wilfully gave him op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. We may eaſily imagine the Grief with which <hi>Anſelmo</hi> hid himſelf, ſince it was to be a Spectator of his own Diſhonour, and the loſs of all that Happineſs he poſſeſs'd in the Embraces of his beautiful and belov'd <hi>Camilla.</hi> On the other hand, ſhe being now certain that <hi>Anſelmo</hi> was hid, enter'd the Wardrobe with <hi>Leonela,</hi> and fetching a deep and piteous Sight, thus addreſs'd her ſelf to her: Ah! my <hi>Leonela!</hi> would it not be much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that thou pierce this infamous Boſom with <hi>Anſelmo</hi>'s Dagger, before I Execute what I deſign, which I have kept from thee that thou might'ſt not endeavour to diſappoint me? Yet not ſo; for, where is the Juſtice that I ſhould ſuffer for another's Offence? No, I will firſt know of <hi>Lothario</hi> what Action of mine has given him aſſurance to make me a diſcovery of a Paſſion ſo injurious to his Friend, and my Honour. Go to the Window <hi>Leonela,</hi> and call the wicked Man to me, who doubtleſs is waiting in the Street the Signal for his Admiſſion to accompliſh his Villanous Deſign; yet firſt my Reſolution ſhall be performed, which tho' it be cruel, is what my Honour ſtrictly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of me. Alas! my dear Lady, cry'd the cunning <hi>Leonela,</hi> alaſs! What do you intend to do with that Dagger? Is your fatal Deſign againſt your ſelf or <hi>Lothario?</hi> Alaſs! you can Attack neither without the Ruin of your Fame and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. You had better give no Opportunity to that bad Man by admitting him while we are
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:54446:241"/>
thus alone in the Houſe. Conſider, Madam, we are but two weak, and helpleſs Women, he a ſtrong and reſolute Man, whoſe Force is redoubl'd by the Paſſion and Deſire that poſſeſs him; ſo that before you may be able to accompliſh what you deſign, he may commit a Crime that will be more injurious to you than the loſs of your Life. We have reaſon to curſe my Maſter <hi>Anſelmo,</hi> who gives ſuch frequent Opportunites to Impudence and Diſhoneſty to pollute our Houſe. But, Madam, ſuppoſe you ſhould kill him, as I believe you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, what ſhall we do with his dead Body? What! ſaid <hi>Camilla,</hi> why we would leave him in this place to be bury'd by <hi>Anſelmo;</hi> for it muſt be a grateful Trouble to him to bury with his own Hand his own Infamy and Diſhonour. Call him therefore quickly, for methinks every Moment my Revenge is deferr'd, I Injure that Loyalty I owe to my Husband.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſelmo</hi> gave great attention to all that was ſaid, and every Word of <hi>Camilla</hi>'s made a ſtrange alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in his Sentiments, ſo that he could ſcarce forbear coming out to prevent his Friend's Death, when he heard her deſperate Reſolution againſt his Life; but his deſire of ſeeing the end of ſo brave a Reſolve with-held him, till he ſaw an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity of diſcovering himſelf to hinder the Miſchief. Now <hi>Camilla</hi> put on a fear and weakneſs which reſembl'd a Swoon; and having thrown her ſelf on a Bed in the Room, <hi>Leonela</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a moſt doleful Lamentation over her: Alas! ſaid ſhe, how unfortunate ſhould I be, if my Lady, ſo eminent for Virtue and Chaſtity as well as Beauty, ſhould thus periſh in my Arms? This, and much more ſhe utter'd with that force of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Diſſimulation, that whoever had ſeen her wou'd have concluded her one of the moſt innocent
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:54446:241"/>
Virgins in the World, and her Lady a meer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted <hi>Penelope. Camilla</hi> ſoon came to her ſelf, and cry'd to <hi>Leonela,</hi> why don't you call the moſt Treacherous and Unfaithful of Friends? Go, fly, and let not thy delays waſte my Revenge and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in meer Words and idle Threats and Curſes. Madam, reply'd <hi>Leonela,</hi> I will go, but you muſt firſt give me that Dagger, leſt you commit ſome outrage upon your ſelf in my abſence, which may give an eternal Cauſe of ſorrow to all your Friends that love and value you. Let not thoſe Fears detain you, ſaid <hi>Camilla,</hi> but aſſure your ſelf I will not do any thing till you return; for tho' I ſhall not fear to puniſh my ſelf in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, yet I ſhall not, like <hi>Lucretia,</hi> puniſh my ſelf without killing him that was the principal cauſe of my Diſhonour. If I muſt die, I ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it; but I will firſt ſatisfie my Revenge on him that has tempted me to come to this guilty Aſſignation, to make him lament his Crime with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being guilty of any my ſelf.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Camilla</hi> could ſcarce prevail with <hi>Leonela</hi> to leave her alone, but at laſt ſhe obey'd her and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, when <hi>Camilla</hi> entertain'd her ſelf and her Husband with this following Soliloquy: Good Heav'n ſaid ſhe, had I not better have continued my Repulſes, than by this ſeeming Conſent ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>Lothario</hi> to think Scandalouſly of me, till my Actions ſhall convince him of his Error? That indeed might have been better in ſome reſpects, but then I ſhould have wanted this opportunity of Revenge, and the Satisfaction of my Husband's injur'd Honour, if he were permitted without any Correction to go off with the Inſolence of offering ſuch Criminal Aſſaults to my Virtue. No, no, let the Traitor's Life attone for the guilt of his falſe and unfaithful Attempts; and
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:54446:242"/>
his Blood quench that lewd Fire he was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſhould burn in his own Breaſt. Let the World be witneſs, if it ever comes to know my Story, that <hi>Camilla</hi> thought it not enough to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve her Virtue and Loyalty to her Husband en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, but alſo reveng'd the hateful affront and the intended deſtruction of it. But it might be moſt convenient perhaps to let <hi>Anſelmo</hi> know of this before I put my Revenge in Execution; yet on the firſt Attempt I ſent him word of it to the Village, and I can attribute his not reſenting ſo notorious an Abuſe to nothing but his Generous Temper, and Confidence in his Friend, incapable of believing ſo try'd a Friend could be guilty of ſo much as a Thought againſt his Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; nor is this incredulity ſo ſtrange, ſince I for ſo long together could not perſwade my ſelf of the truth of what my Eyes and Ears convey'd to me; and nothing could have convinc'd me of my generous Error, had his Inſolency kept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in any Bounds, and not dar'd to proceed to large Gifts, large Promiſes, and a flood of Tears, which he ſhed as the undiſſembl'd Teſtimony of his Paſſion. But to what purpoſe are theſe Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations? Or is there indeed any need of conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to perſwade me to a brave Reſolve? <hi>Av<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Let the Event be as unlucky as it will, the worſt Sollution I can this way ſuffer is of mingling my own Chaſte Blood with the impure and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Blood of the moſt Falſe and Treacherous of Friends. Having ſaid this, ſhe travers'd the Room
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:54446:242"/>
in ſo paſſionate a manner, with the drawn Dagger in her Hand, and ſhew'd ſuch an Agitation of Spirit in her Looks and Motion, that ſhe appear'd like one diſtracted, or more like a Murderer, than a tender and delicate Lady.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſelmo,</hi> not a little to his ſatisfaction, very plainly ſaw and heard all this from behind the Arras, which with the greateſt Reaſon and Evidence in the World remov'd all his paſt Doubts and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, and he with abundance of concern wiſh'd that <hi>Lothario</hi> would not come, that he might by that means eſcape the Danger that ſo apparently threaten'd him; to prevent which he had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd himſelf, had he not ſeen <hi>Leonela</hi> at that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant bring <hi>Lothario</hi> into the Room. As ſoon as <hi>Camilla</hi> ſaw him enter, ſhe deſcrib'd a Line with the Poniard on the Ground, and told him the Minuit he preſum'd to paſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> that, ſhe would ſtrike the Dagger to his Heart: Hear me, ſaid ſhe, and obſerve what I ſay without Interruption; when I have done, you ſhall have liberty to make what Reply you pleaſe. Tell me firſt, <hi>Lothario,</hi> do you know my Husband, and do you know me? The Queſtion is not ſo difficult but you may give me immediate Anſwer; there is no need of conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſpeak therefore without delay. <hi>Lothario</hi> was not ſo dull as not to gueſs at her Deſign in having her Husband hid behind the Hangings, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore adapted his Anſwers ſo well to her Queſtions, that the Fiction was loſt in the appearance of Reality. I did never imagine, fair <hi>Camilla,</hi> ſaid <hi>Lothario,</hi> that you would make this Aſſignation to ask Queſtions ſo diſtant from the dear End of my Coming. If you had a mind ſtill to delay my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd Happineſs, you ſhould have prepar'd me for the Diſappointment; for, the nearer the Hope of Poſſeſſion brings us to the Good we deſire, the
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:54446:243"/>
greater is the Pain to have thoſe Hopes deſtroy'd. But to anſwer your Demands, I muſt own, Madam, that I do know your Husband, and he me; that this Knowledge has grown up with us from our Childhood; and that I may be a witneſs againſt my ſelf of the Injury I am compell'd by Love to do him, I do alſo own, Divine <hi>Camilla,</hi> that you too well know the tenderneſs of our mutual Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; yet Love is a ſufficient excuſe for all my Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, if they were much more Criminal than they are. And, Madam, that I know you is evident, and love you equal to him, for nothing but your Charms could have Power enough to make me forget what I owe to my own Honour, and what to the holy Laws of Friendſhip, all which I have been forc'd to break by the reſiſtleſs Tyranny of Love. Ah! had I known you leſs, I had been more Innocent. If you confeſs all this, ſaid <hi>Camilla,</hi> if you know us both, how dare you vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate ſo Sacred a Friendſhip, injure ſo true a Friend, and appear thus confidently before me, whom you know to be eſteem'd by him the Mirror of his Love, in which that Love ſo often views it ſelf with Pleaſure and Satisfaction; and in which you ought to have ſurvey'd your ſelf ſo far, as to have ſeen how ſmall the Temptation is, that has prevail'd on you to wrong him. But alas! this points me to the cauſe of your Tranſgreſſion, ſome ſuſpicious Action of mine when I have been leaſt on my Guard, as thinking my ſelf alone; but aſſure your ſelf, whatever it was, it proceeds not from Looſeneſs or Levity of Principle, but a Negligence and Liberty which the Sex ſometimes innocently fall into when they think themſelves unobſerv'd. If this were not the Cauſe, ſay, Traitor, when did I liſten to your Prayers, or in the leaſt regard your Tears and Vows, ſo that you
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:54446:243"/>
might derive from thence the ſmalleſt hope of accompliſhing your infamous Deſires? Did I not always with the laſt Averſion and Diſdain reject your Criminal Paſſion? Did I ever betray a Belief in thy laviſh Promiſes? or admit of thy prodigal Gifts? But ſince without ſome Hope no Love can long ſubſiſt, I will lay that hateful guilt on ſome unhappy inadvertency of mine, and therefore will inflict the ſame puniſhment on my ſelf that your Crimes deſerves. And to ſhew you that I cannot but be cruel to you, who will not ſpare my ſelf, I ſent for you to be a Witneſs of that juſt Sacrifice I ſhall make to my dear Husband's Injur'd Honour, on which you have fix'd the blackeſt Mark of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy that your Malice could inſpire, and which I alas! have ſully'd too by my thoughtleſs neglect of depriving you of the occaſion, if indeed I gave any, of nouriſhing your wicked Intentions. Once more I tell you, that the bare ſuſpicion that my want of Caution, and ſetting ſo ſevere a Guard on my Actions as I ought, has made you harbour ſuch wild and infamous Intentions, is the ſharpeſt of my Afflictions, and what with my own Hands I reſolve to puniſh with the utmoſt Severity. For, ſhould I leave that Puniſhment to another, it would but increaſe my guilt. Yet I will die; but firſt to ſatisfy my Revenge, and impartial Juſtice, I will unmov'd and unrelenting deſtory the fatal Cauſe that has reduc'd me to this deſperate Condition.</p>
                           <p>At theſe Words ſhe flew with ſuch Violence, and ſo well acted a Fury on <hi>Lothario</hi> with her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Dagger, that he could ſcarce think it feign'd, and therefore ſecur'd himſelf from her Blow by avoiding it, and holding her Hand. Thereupon, to give more Life to the Fiction, as in a Rage at her diſappointed Revenge on <hi>Lothario,</hi> ſhe cry'd
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:54446:244"/>
out, ſince my malicious Fortune denies a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Satisfaction to my juſt Deſires, at leaſt it ſhall not be in its Power entirely to defeat my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. With that, drawing back her Dagger-Hand from <hi>Lothario</hi> who held it, ſhe ſtruck it into that part of her Body where it might do her the leaſt damage, and then fell down, as fainting away with the Wound. <hi>Lothario</hi> and <hi>Leonela</hi> ſurpriz'd at the unexpected Event, knew not yet what to think, ſeeing her ſtill lie all bloody on the Ground; <hi>Lothario</hi> pale and trembling ran to her to take out the Dagger, but was deliver'd of his Fears when he ſaw ſo little Blood follow it, and more than ever admir'd the cunning and wit of the Beautiful <hi>Camilla.</hi> Yet to play his part as well, and ſhew himſelf a Friend, he lamented over <hi>Camilla</hi>'s Body in the moſt pathetick manner in the World, as if ſhe had been really dead; he curs'd himſelf, and curs'd his Friend that had put him on that fatal Experiment; and knowing that <hi>Anſelmo</hi> heard him, he ſaid ſuch things as were able to draw a greater pity for him than even for <hi>Camilla,</hi> though ſhe ſeem'd to have loſt her Life in the unfortunate Adventure. <hi>Leonela</hi> remov'd her Body to the Bed, and begg'd <hi>Lothario</hi> to go ſeek ſome Surgeon, that might with all the ſecreſie in the World cure her Lady's Wound<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> She alſo ask'd his Advice, how to excuſe to her Maſter, if he ſhould return be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was perfectly cur'd. He reply'd, they might ſay what they pleas'd, That he was not in a humour of adviſing, but bid her endeavour to ſtanch her Miſtreſs's Blood, for he would go where they ſhould never hear more of him; and ſo he left them, with all the appearance of Grief and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern that the Occaſion requir'd. He was no ſooner gone, but he had leiſure to reflect with the greateſt wonder imaginable, on <hi>Camilla's</hi> and her Woman's
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:54446:244"/>
Conduct in this Affair; and on the Aſſurance which this Scene had given <hi>Anſelmo</hi> of his Wife's Virtue; ſince now he could not but believe he had a ſecond <hi>Portia,</hi> and he long'd to meet him, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce over the beſt diſſembl'd Impoſture that ever bore away the Opinion of Truth. <hi>Leonela</hi> ſtanch'd the Blood, which was no more than was neceſſary for covering the Cheat, and waſhing the Wound with Wine only as ſhe bound it up, her diſcourſe was ſo moving, and ſo well acted, that it had been alone ſufficient to have convinc'd <hi>Anſelmo</hi> that he had the moſt virtuous Wife in the World. <hi>Camilla</hi> was not ſilent, but added freſh Confirmations; in every word ſhe ſpoke, ſhe complain'd of her Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe and Baſeneſs of Spirit, that deny'd her time and force to diſpatch that Life, which was now ſo hateful to her. She ask'd her too, whether ſhe ſhould inform her Husband of what had paſs'd, or not? <hi>Leonela</hi> was for her concealing it, ſince the diſcovery muſt infallibly engage her Husband in a Revenge on <hi>Lothario,</hi> which muſt as certainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him too; for thoſe things were never accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd without the greateſt danger; and that a good Wife ought to the beſt of her Power pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent involving her Husband in Quarrels. <hi>Camilla</hi> yielded to her Reaſons; but added, that they muſt find out ſome pretended cauſe of her Wound, which he would certainly ſee at his return. <hi>Leonela</hi> reply'd, that it was a difficult task, ſince ſhe was incapable even in Jeſt to diſſemble the Truth. Am I not, anſwer'd <hi>Camilla,</hi> under the ſame difficulty, who cannot ſave my Life by the odious Refuge of a falſhood? Had we not better than confeſs the real Truth, than be caught in a Lie? Well, Madam, return'd <hi>Leonela,</hi> let this give you no further Trouble, by to morrow Morning I ſhall find out ſome expedient or other; though I hope
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:54446:245"/>
the place where the Wound is, may conceal it enough from his obſervation to ſecure us from all apprehenſion; leave therefore the whole event to Heaven, which always favours and aſſiſts the Innocent.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſelmo</hi> ſaw and heard this formal Tragedy of his ruin'd Honour, with all the Attention im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginable, in which all the Actors perform'd their Parts ſo to the Life, that they ſeem'd the Truth they repreſented; he wiſh'd with the laſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience for the Night, that he might convey him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from his hiding place, to his Friend's Houſe, and there rejoyce for this happy diſcovery of his Wife's experienc'd Virtue. <hi>Camilla</hi> and her Maid took care to furniſh him with an opportunity of departing, of which he ſoon took hold, for fear of loſing it. 'Tis impoſſible to tell you all the Embraces he gave <hi>Lothario,</hi> and the joy and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme ſatisfaction he expreſs'd at his good Fortue, or the extravagant Praiſes he gave <hi>Camilla. Lotha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio</hi> heard all this without taking a Friend's ſhare in the Pleaſure, for he was ſhock'd with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern he had to ſee his Friend ſo groſsly impos'd on, and the guilt of his own Infidelity in injuring his Honour. Though <hi>Anſelmo</hi> eaſily perceiv'd that <hi>Lothario</hi> was not touch'd with any pleaſure at his Relation, yet he believ'd <hi>Camilla</hi>'s Wound caus'd by him, was the true motive of his not ſharing his joy, and therefore aſſur'd him, he need not too much trouble himſelf for it, ſince it could not be dangerous, ſhe and her Woman having agreed to conceal it from him. This cauſe of his fear being remov'd, he deſir'd him to put on a face of Joy, ſince by his means he ſhould now poſſeſs a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect happineſs and content, and therefore he would ſpend the reſt of his Life in conveying <hi>Camilla</hi>'s Virtue to Poſterity, by writing her Praiſe in
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:54446:245"/>
Verſe. <hi>Lotharia</hi> approv'd his Reſolution, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to do the ſame. Thus <hi>Anſelmo</hi> remain'd the moſt delightfully deceiv'd of any Man alive. He therefore carry'd <hi>Lothario</hi> immediately to his Houſe, as the Inſtrument of his Glory, though he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the only cauſe of his Infamy and Diſhonour. <hi>Camilla</hi> receiv'd him with a face, that ill expreſs'd the ſatisfacton of her Mind, being forc'd to put on Frowns in her looks, while her Heart prompted nothing but ſmiles of Joy for his preſence.</p>
                           <p>For ſome Months the Fraud was conceal'd, but then Fortune turning her Wheel, diſcover'd to the World the Wickedneſs they had ſo long and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially diſguis'd, and <hi>Anſelmo</hi>'s impertinent Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity coſt him his Life.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> The Concluſion of the Novel of the Curious Impertinent.</head>
                           <p>THE Novel was come near a Concluſion, when <hi>Sancho Pança</hi> came running out of Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Chamber in a terrible Fright, and crying out help, help, good People, help my Maſter, he's juſt now at it, Tooth and Nail, with that ſame Gyant, the Princeſs <hi>Micomicona</hi>'s Foe: I ne'er ſaw a more dreadful Battel in my born days. He has lent him ſuch a Sliver, that whip, off went the Giant's Head, as round as a Turnip. You're mad, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid the Curate interrupted in his Reading; is thy Maſter ſuch a Devil of a Heroe, as to fight a Gyant at two thouſand Leagues diſtance? Upon this, they preſently heard a
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:54446:246"/>
noiſe and buſtle in the Chamber, and Don <hi>Quixote</hi> bawling out, Stay Villain, Robber, ſtay; ſince I have thee here, thy Scimitar ſhall but little avail thee; and with this, they heard him ſtrike with his Sword with all his force againſt the Walls. Good folks, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> my Maſter does not want your hearkning; why don't you run in, and help him; though I believe 'tis after Meat Muſtard, for ſure the Gyant is by this time gone to Pot, and giving an Account of his ill Life: For I ſaw his Blood run all about the Houſe, and his Head ſailing in the middle on't: But ſuch a Head! 'Tis bigger than any Wine-bagg in <hi>Spain.</hi> Death and Hell (cries the Inn-keeper) I'll be cut like a Cucum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, if this Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> or Don Devil, has not been hacking my Wine-baggs that ſtood fill'd at his Bed's head, and this Coxcomb has taken the ſpilt Liquor for Blood. Then running with the whole Company into the Room, they found the poor Knight in the moſt comical poſture imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                           <p>He was ſtanding in his Shirt, the fore part of it ſcarcely reaching to the bottom of his Belly, and about a ſpan ſhorter behind; this added a very peculiar Air to his long, lean Legs, as dirty and hairy as a Beaſts. To make him all of a piece, he wore on his Head a little red greaſie caſt Night-cap of the Inn-keeper's; he had wrapped one of the Bed-Blankets about his left Arm for a Shield; and weilded his drawn Sword in the Right, laying about him pell mell; with now and then a ſtart of ſome military Expreſſion, as if he had been really engag'd with ſome Giant. But the beſt jeſt of all, he was all this time faſt aſleep; for the thoughts of the Adventure he had undertaken, had ſo wrought on his Imagitation, that his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prav'd fancy had in his ſleep repreſented to him
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:54446:246"/>
the Kingdom of <hi>Micomicon</hi> and the Giant; and dreaming that he was then fighting him, he Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted the Wine-bags ſo deſperately, that he ſet the whole Chamber a-float with good Wine. The Inn-keeper, enrag'd to ſee the havock, flew at Don <hi>Quixote</hi> with his Fiſts; and had not <hi>Cardenio</hi> and the Curate taken him off, he had prov'd a Giant indeed againſt the Knight. All this could not wake the poor Don, till the Barber throwing a Bucket of cold Water upon him, waken'd him from his ſleep, though not from his dream.</p>
                           <p>The ſhortneſs of her Champion's Shirt gave <hi>Dorothea</hi> a Surfeit of the Battle. <hi>Sancho</hi> ran up and down the Room ſearching for the Giant's Head, till finding his labour fruitleſs; Well, well, ſaid he, now I ſee plainly that this Houſe is haunted, for when I was here before, in this very Room was I beaten like any Stock-fiſh, but knew no more than the Man in the Moon who ſtruck me; and now the Giant's Head, that I ſaw cut off with theſe Eyes, is vaniſh'd; and I'm ſure I ſaw the Body ſpout Blood like a Pump. What a prating and a nonſenſe does this damn'd Son of a Whore keep about Blood, and a Pump, and I know not what, ſaid the Inn-keeper, I tell you, Raſcal, 'tis my Wine-baggs that are flaſh'd, and my Wine that runs about the Floor here, and I hope to ſee the Soul of him that ſpilt it ſwimming in Hell for his Pains. Well, well, (ſaid <hi>Sancho</hi>) don't trouble me; I only tell ye, that I can't find the Giant's Head, and my Earldom is gone after it, and ſo I'm undone, as a Man would undo an Oiſter: And truly <hi>Sancho</hi>'s waking Dream was as pleaſant as his Maſter's when aſleep; the Inn-keeper was almoſt mad too, to ſee the fooliſh Squire harp ſo on the ſame ſtring with his frantick Maſter, and ſwore they ſhould not come off now as before;
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:54446:247"/>
that their Chivalry ſhould be no ſatisfaction for his Wine, but that they ſhould pay him ſauce for the damage, and for the very Leathern Patches which the wounded Wine-baggs would want.</p>
                           <p>Don <hi>Quixote</hi> in the mean time, believing he had finiſh'd his Adventure, and miſtaking the Curate, that held him by the Arms, for the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Micomicona,</hi> fell on his knees before him, and with a reſpect due to a Royal Preſence; Now may your Highneſs, ſaid he, great, and illuſtrious Princeſs, live ſecure, free from any further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions from your Conquer'd Enemy, and now am I acquitted of my Engagement, ſince by the aſſiſtance of Heaven, and the Influence of her Favour by whom I live and Conquer, your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture is ſo happily atchiev'd. Did not I tell you ſo, Gentlefolks, (ſaid <hi>Sancho</hi>) who is Drunk or Mad now? Did not I ſay, that he had paid off the Giant; the Battel is over, and I am an Earl. The whole Company, (except the Inn-keeper, who gave himſelf to the Devil) were like to ſplit at the Extravagancies of Maſter and Man: at laſt <hi>Cardenio</hi> and the Curate, having with much ado got Don <hi>Quixote</hi> to Bed, he preſently fell aſleep, being heartily tir'd; and then they left him, to comfort <hi>Sancho Pança</hi> for the loſs of the Giant's Head, and the Inn-keeper for the unexpected and ſudden Fate of his Wine-bags.</p>
                           <p>The Hoſteſs in the mean time ran up and down the Houſe grumbling and whining: In an ill hour, ſaid ſhe, did this unlucky Knight-Errant come into my Houſe, I wiſh for my part I had never ſeen him, for he has been a dear Gueſt to me. He and his Man, his Horſe and his Aſs, went away laſt time without paying me a croſs for their Supper, their Bed, their Litter and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vender; and all, forſooth, becauſe he was ſeeking
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:54446:247"/>
Adventures, I ſay: What the Plague have I to do with his Statutes of Chivalry? if they oblige him not to pay, they muſt oblige him not to eat nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 'Twas upon this Score that the t'other Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low took away my good Tail; 'tis clear ſpoil'd, the Hair is all fall'n off, and my Husband can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver uſe it again. And now to come upon me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with deſtroying my Wine Bags and ſpilling my Liquor, may ſome Body ſpill his Heart's Blood for't for me: But I will be paid, ſo I will, and that handſomely too; I will have Satisfaction, Jill by Jill, every Piece, for what I have loſt. Her honeſt Maid <hi>Maritornes</hi> ſeconded her Fury; but Mr. Curate ſtopp'd their Mouths, by promiſing that he would ſee them ſatisfy'd for their Wine and their Bags, but eſpecially for the Tail which they kept ſuch a Clutter about. <hi>Dorothea</hi> comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Sancho,</hi> aſſuring him that whenever it appear'd that his Maſter had kill'd the Giant, and reſtor'd her to her Dominions, he ſhould be ſure of the beſt Earldom in her Diſpoſal. With this he huckl'd up again, and ſwore that he himſelf had ſeen the Giant's Head, by the ſame Token that it had a Beard that reach'd down to his Middle; and if it could not be found it muſt be hid by Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, for every thing went by Inchantment in that Houſe, as he had try'd it to his Coſt when he was there before. <hi>Dorothea</hi> anſwer'd, that ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd him; and deſir'd him to pluck up his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, for all things would be well. All Parties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quieted, <hi>Cardenio, Dorothea,</hi> and the reſt, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated the Curate to finiſh the Novel, which was ſo near a Concluſion; and he, in Obedience to their Commands, took up the Book and read on.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſelmo</hi> grew ſo ſatisfy'd in <hi>Camilla</hi>'s Virtue, that he liv'd with all the Content and Security in the World; to confirm which, <hi>Camilla</hi> ever in her
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:54446:248"/>
Looks ſeem'd to diſcover her Averſion to <hi>Lothario,</hi> which made him deſire <hi>Anſelmo</hi> to diſpence with his coming to his Houſe, ſince he found how averſe his Wife was to him, and how great a Diſguſt ſhe had to his Company; but <hi>Anſelmo</hi> would not be perſwaded to yield to his Requeſt, and was ſo blind, that ſeeking his Content, he perpetually promoted his Diſhonour. He was not the only Perſon pleas'd with the Condition he liv'd in; <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nela</hi> was ſo tranſported by her Amour, that, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd by her Lady's Connivance, ſhe perfectly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd her ſelf to the indiſcreet Enjoyment of her Gallant: So that one Night her Maſter heard ſome body in her Chamber, and coming to the Door to diſcover who it was, he found it held faſt againſt him; but at laſt forcing it open, he ſaw one leap out of the Window the Inſtant he enter'd the Room: He wou'd have purſu'd him, but <hi>Leonela</hi> clinging about him, begg'd him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe his Anger and Concern, ſince the Perſon that made his Eſcape was her Husband. <hi>Anſelmo</hi> would not believe her, but drawing his Dagger, threatn'd to kill her if ſhe did not immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make full Diſcovery of the Matter. Diſtracted with Fear, ſhe begg'd him to ſpare her Life, and ſhe would diſcover things that more nearly related to him than he imagin'd. Speak quickly then, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd <hi>Anſelmo,</hi> or you die. 'Tis impoſſible, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd ſhe, that in this Confuſion and Fright I ſhould ſay any thing that can be underſtood; but give me but till to Morrow Morning, and I will lay ſuch things before you, as will ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurprize and amaze you; but believe me, Sir, the Perſon that leapt out of the Window is a young Man of this City who is contracted to me. This ſomething appeas'd <hi>Anſelmo,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd with him to allow her till the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:54446:248"/>
to make her Confeſſion; for he was too well aſſur'd of <hi>Camilla</hi>'s Virtue by the paſt Trial, to ſuſpect that there could be any thing relating to her in what <hi>Leonela</hi> had to tell him: Wherefore faſtening her in her Room, and threatning that ſhe ſhould never come out till ſhe had done what ſhe had promis'd, he return'd to his Chamber to <hi>Camilla,</hi> and told her all that had paſs'd, without omitting the Promiſe ſhe had given to make ſome ſtrange Diſcovery to him the next Morning. You may eaſily imagine the Concern this gave <hi>Camilla;</hi> ſhe made no Doubt but that the Diſcovery <hi>Leonela</hi> had promis'd was of her Diſloyalty; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out waiting to know whether it were ſo or not, that very Night, as ſoon as <hi>Anſelmo</hi> was aſleep, taking with her all her Jewels and ſome Money, ſhe got undiſcover'd out of the Houſe, and went to <hi>Lothario,</hi> inform'd him of all that had paſs'd, and deſir'd him either to put her into ſome Place of Safety, or to go with her where they might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy each other ſecure from the Fears of <hi>Anſelmo.</hi> This ſurprizing Relation ſo confounded <hi>Lothario,</hi> that for ſome Time he knew not what he did, or what Reſolution to take; but at laſt, with <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milla</hi>'s Conſent, he put her into a Monaſtery where his Siſter was Abbeſs; and immediately, without acquainting any Body with his Departure, left the City.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſelmo</hi> as ſoon as it was Day got up, without miſſing his Wife, and made Haſte to <hi>Leonela</hi>'s Chamber to hear what ſhe had to ſay to him; but he found no body there, only the Sheets ty'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and faſten'd to the Window, ſhew'd which Way ſhe had made her Eſcape; on which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd very ſad to tell <hi>Camilla</hi> the Adventure, but was extremely ſurpriz'd when he found her not in the whole Houſe, nor could hear any News of
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:54446:249"/>
her from his Servants: But, finding in his Search her Trunks open, and moſt of her Jewels gone, he no longer doubted of his Diſhonour: ſo, pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and half dreſs'd as he was, he went to <hi>Lothario</hi>'s Lodging to tell him his Misfortune; but when his Servants inform'd him that he was gone that very Night with all his Money and Jewels, his Pangs were redoubl'd, and his Grief encreas'd almoſt to Madneſs. To conclude, he return'd home, found his Houſe empty, for Fear had driven away all his Servants. He knew not what to think, ſay, or do; he ſaw himſelf forſaken by his Friend, his Wife, and his very Servants, with whom he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd that Heaven it ſelf had abandon'd him; but his greateſt Trouble was to find himſelf robb'd of his Honour and Reputation, for <hi>Camilla</hi>'s Crime was but too evident from all theſe concurring Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. After a thouſand diſtracting Thoughts, he reſolv'd to retreat to that Village whither he formerly retir'd to give <hi>Lothario</hi> an Opportunity to ruin him; wherefore faſtning up his Doors, he took Horſe, full of Deſpair and languiſhing Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, the Violence of which was ſo great, that he had ſcarce rid half Way when he was forc'd to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and tying his Horſe to a Tree, he threw himſelf beneath it, and ſpent in that melancholy Poſture a thouſand racking Reflections, moſt Part of the Day, till a little before Night he diſcover'd a Paſſenger coming the ſame Road, of whom he enquir'd what News at <hi>Florence?</hi> The Traveller reply'd, that the moſt ſurprizing News that had been heard of late, was now all the Talk of the City, which was, that <hi>Lothario</hi> had that very Night carry'd away the wealthy <hi>Anſelmo</hi>'s Wife <hi>Camilla;</hi> which is all confeſs'd by <hi>Camilla</hi>'s Woman, who was apprehended that Night as ſhe ſlipt from the Window of <hi>Anſelmo</hi>'s Houſe by a Pair of Sheets.
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:54446:249"/>
The Truth of the Story I cannot affirm, continu'd the Traveller; but every Body is aſtoniſh'd at the Accident; for no Man could ever ſuſpect ſuch a Crime from a Perſon engag'd in ſo ſtrict a Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with <hi>Anſelmo</hi> as <hi>Lothario</hi> was, for they were called the <hi>Two Friends.</hi> Is it yet known, reply'd <hi>Anſelmo,</hi> which way <hi>Lothario</hi> and <hi>Camilla</hi> are gone? No, Sir, return'd the Traveller, though the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour has made as ſtrict a Search after 'em as is poſſible. <hi>Anſelmo</hi> ask'd no more Queſtions, but, after they had taken their Leaves of each other, the Traveller left him and purſu'd his Journey.</p>
                           <p>This mournful News ſo affected the unfortunate <hi>Anſelmo,</hi> that he was ſtruck with Death almoſt that very Moment; getting therefore on his Horſe as well as he could, he arriv'd at his Friend's Houſe. He knew nothing yet of his Diſgrace, but ſeeing him ſo pale and melancholy, concluded that ſome great Misfortune had befall'n him. <hi>Anſelmo</hi> deſir'd to be immediately led to his Chamber, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with Pen, Ink, and Paper, and to be left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone with his Door lock'd: When, finding that his End approach'd, he reſolv'd to leave in Writing the Cauſe of his ſudden and unexpected Death. Taking therefore the Pen, he began to write; but, unable to finiſh what he deſign'd, he dy'd a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr to his impertinent Curioſity. The Gentleman finding he did not call, and that it grew late, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to enter his Chamber, and ſee whether his Friend were better or worſe; he found him half out of Bed, lying on his Face, with the Pen in his Hand, and a Paper open before him. Seeing him in this Poſture he drew near him, call'd and mov'd him, but ſoon found he was dead; which made him call his Servants to behold the unhappy Event, and then took up the Paper, which he ſaw was
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:54446:250"/>
written in <hi>Anſelmo</hi>'s own Hand, and was to this Effect.</p>
                           <p>A <hi>Fooliſh and impertinent Deſire has robb'd me of Life. If</hi> Camilla <hi>hear of my Death, let her know that I forgive her; for ſhe was not oblig'd to do Miracles, nor was there any Reaſon I ſhould have deſir'd or expected it; and ſince I contriv'd my own Diſhonour, there is no Cauſe</hi> —</p>
                           <p>Thus far <hi>Anſelmo</hi> writ, but Life would not hold out till he could give the Reaſons he deſign'd. The next Day the Gentleman of the Houſe ſent Word of <hi>Anſelmo</hi>'s Death to his Relations, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready knew his Misfortune, as well as the Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry whither <hi>Camilla</hi> was retir'd. She her ſelf was indeed very near that Death which her Husband had paſs'd, though not for the Loſs of him but <hi>Lotha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio,</hi> of which ſhe had lately heard a flying Report. But though ſhe was a Widow now, ſhe would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther take the Veil, nor leave the Monaſtery, till in a few Days the News was confirm'd of his being ſlain in a Battel betwixt Monſieur <hi>de Lautrec</hi> and that great General <hi>Gonzalo Fernandez de Cordoua,</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples.</hi> This was the End of the offending, and too late penitent Friend; the News of which made <hi>Camilla</hi> immediately profeſs her ſelf, and ſoon after overwhelm'd with Grief and Melancholy, pay for her Tranſgreſſion with the Loſs of her Life. This was the unhappy End of them all, proceeding from ſo impertinent a Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                           <p>I like this Novel well enough, ſaid the Curate; yet after all I cannot perſwade my ſelf, that there's any thing of Truth in it; and if it be purely In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, the Author was in the Wrong, for 'tis not
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:54446:250"/>
to be imagin'd there can ever be a Husband ſo fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, as to venture on ſo dangerous an Experiment. Had he made his Husband and Wife, a Gallant and a Miſtreſs, the Fable had appear'd more probable; but, as it is, 'tis next to impoſſible. However, I muſt confeſs, I have nothing to object againſt his manner of telling it.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Containing an Account of many ſurprizing Accidents in the Inn.</head>
                           <p>AT the ſame Time the Inn-keeper, who ſtood at the Door, ſeeing Company coming, More Gueſts, cry'd he, a brave jolly Troop, on my Word. If they ſtop here, we may ſing O <hi>be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> What are they, ſaid <hi>Cardenio?</hi> Four Men, ſaid the Hoſt gallantly Mounted, with black Masks on their Faces, and Arm'd with Lances and Targets; a Lady too all in white, that rides ſingle and Mask'd; and two running Foot men. Are they near, ſaid the Curate? Juſt at the Door, reply'd the Inn-keeper. Hearing this, <hi>Dorothea</hi> veil'd her ſelf, and <hi>Cardenio</hi> had juſt time enough to ſtep into the next Room, where Don <hi>Quixote</hi> lay, when the Strangers came into the Yard. The four Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who made a very genteel Appearance diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted, and went to help down the Lady, whom one of them taking in his Arms, carry'd into the Houſe; where he ſeated her in a Chair by the Chamber-door, into which <hi>Cardenio</hi> had withdrawn. All this was done without diſcovering their Faces,
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:54446:251"/>
or ſpeaking a Word; only the Lady as ſhe ſat down in the Chair, breath'd out a deep Sigh, and let her Arms ſink down in a weak and fainting Poſture. The Curate, marking their odd Behaviour, which rais'd in him a Curioſity to know who they were, went to their Servants in the Stable, and ask'd what their Maſters were? Indeed Sir, ſaid one of them, that's more than I can tell you; they ſeem of no mean Quality, eſpecially that Gentleman who carry'd the Lady into the Houſe, for the reſt pay him great Reſpect, and his Word is a Law to them. Who is the Lady, ſaid the Curate? We know no more of her than of the reſt anſwer'd the Fellow, for we could never ſee her Face all the time, and 'tis impoſſible we ſhould know her or them any otherwiſe. They pick'd us up on the Road, my Comrade and my ſelf, and prevail'd with us to wait on them to <hi>Andaluſia,</hi> promiſing to pay us well for our Trouble; ſo that, bating the two days Travelling in their Company, they are utter Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to us. Could you not hear them name one another all this time, ask'd the Curate? No, truly, Sir, anſwer'd the Footman, for we heard them not ſpeak a Syllable all the way: The poor Lady in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed us'd to ſigh and grieve ſo pitifully, that we are perſwaded ſhe has no Stomach to this Journey: Whatever may be the Cauſe we know not; by her Garb ſhe ſeems to be a Nun, but by her Grief and Melancholy one might gueſs they are going to make her one, when perhaps the poor Girl has no Fancy to live in a Nunnery. Very likely, ſaid the Curate; and with that leaving them, he return'd to the Place where he left <hi>Dorothea,</hi> who, hearing the Mask'd Lady ſigh ſo frequently, mov'd by the natural Pity of the ſoft Sex, could not forbear en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring the Cauſe of her Sorrow. Pardon me, Madam, ſaid ſhe, if I beg to know your Grief;
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:54446:251"/>
and aſſure your ſelf, that my Requeſt does not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from meer Curioſity, but an earneſt Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſerve and aſſiſt you, if your Misfortune be any ſuch as our Sex is naturally ſubject to, and in the Power of a Woman to cure. The melancholy Lady made no return to her Compliment, and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rothea</hi> preſs'd her in vain with new Reaſons, when the Gentleman, whom the Foot-boy ſignify'd to be the chief of the Company, interpos'd: Madam, ſaid he, don't trouble your ſelf to throw away any generous Offer on that ungrateful Woman, whoſe Nature cannot return an Obligation; neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any Anſwer to your Demands, for her Tongue is a Stranger to Truth. Sir, ſaid the diſconſolate Lady, my Truth and Honour have made me thus miſerable, and my Sufferings are ſufficient to prove you the falſeſt and moſt baſe of Men. <hi>Cardenio</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only parted from the Company by Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote</hi>'s Chamber-door, over-heard theſe laſt Words very diſtinctly, and immediately cry'd out, Good Heaven, what do I hear! what Voice ſtruck my Ear juſt now? The Lady ſtartl'd at his Exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſprung from the Chair, and would have bolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Chamber whence the Voice came; but the Gentleman perceiving it, laid hold on her, to prevent her, which ſo diſorder'd the Lady that her Mask fell off, and diſcover'd an incomparable Face, Beautiful as an Angel's, tho' very pale, and ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcompos'd, her Eyes eagerly rolling on every ſide, which made her appear diſtracted. <hi>Dorothea</hi> and the reſt, not gueſſing what her Eyes ſought by their violent motion, beheld her with Grief and Wonder. She ſtruggl'd ſo hard, and the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was ſo diſorder'd by holding her, that his Mask dropt off, and diſcover'd to <hi>Dorothea,</hi> who was aſſiſting to hold the Lady, the Face of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band Don <hi>Ferdinand:</hi> Scarce had ſhe known him,
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:54446:252"/>
when with a long and diſmal Oh! ſhe fell in a Swoon, and would have reach'd the Floor with all her Weight, had not the Barber by good Fortune ſtood behind, and ſupported her. The Curate ran preſently to help her, and pulling off her Veil to throw Water in her Face, Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> preſently knew her, and was ſtruck almoſt as dead as ſhe at the Sight; nevertheleſs he did not quit <hi>Lucinda,</hi> who was the Lady that ſtruggl'd ſo hard to get out of his Hands. <hi>Cardenio</hi> hearing <hi>Dorothea</hi>'s Excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and imagining it to be <hi>Lucinda</hi>'s Voice, flew into the Chamber in great Diſorder, and the firſt Object he met was Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> holding <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinda,</hi> who preſently knew him. They were all ſtruck dumb with Amazement: <hi>Dorothea</hi> gaz'd on Don <hi>Ferdinand;</hi> Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> on <hi>Cardenio;</hi> and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denio</hi> and <hi>Lucinda</hi> on one another. At laſt <hi>Lucinda</hi> broke Silence, and addreſſing Don <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> Let me go, ſaid ſhe; unlooſe your hold, my Lord; by the Generoſity you ſhou'd have, or by your Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, ſince it muſt be ſo, I conjure you, leave me, that I may cling like Ivy to my only Support; and from whom neither your Threats, nor Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, nor Gifts, nor Promiſes, could ever alienate my Love. Contend not againſt Heaven, whoſe Power alone could bring me to my dear Husband's Sight, by ſuch ſtrange and unexpected means: You have a thouſand Inſtances to convince you, that nothing but Death can make me ever forget him: Let this at leaſt turn your Love into Rage, which may prompt you to end my Miſeries with my Life, here before my dear Husband, where I ſhall be proud to loſe it, ſince my Death may convince him of my unſhaken Love and Honour, till the laſt Minute of my Life. <hi>Dorothea</hi> by this time had recover'd, and finding by <hi>Lucinda</hi>'s Diſcourſe, who ſhe was, and that Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> would not unhand
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:54446:252"/>
her, ſhe made a Virtue of Neceſſity and falling at his Feet, my Lord, cry'd ſhe, all bath'd in Tears, if that Beauty which you hold in your Arms has not altogether dazl'd your Eyes, you may behold at your Feet, the once happy, but now miſerable <hi>Dorothea.</hi> I am that poor and humble Villager, whom your generous Bounty, I dare not ſay your Love, did condeſcend to raiſe to the honour of calling you her own: I am ſhe, who, once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to peaceful Innocence, led a contented Life, till your Importunity, your Shew of Honour, and deluding Words, charm'd me from my Retreat; and made me reſign my Freedom to your Power: How I am recompenc'd may be gueſs'd by my Grief; and my being found here in this ſtrange Place, whither I was led, not through any diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Ends, but purely by Deſpair and Grief to be forſaken of You. 'Twas at your Deſire I was bound to you by the ſtricteſt Tye, and whatever you do, you can never ceaſe to be mine. Conſider, my dear Lord, that my matchleſs Love may bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the Beauty and Nobility of the Perſon for whom you would forſake me; ſhe cannot ſhare your Love, for 'tis only mine; and <hi>Cardenio</hi>'s Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in her will not admit a Partner. 'Tis eaſier far, my Lord, to re-call your wandring Deſires, and fix them upon her that adores you, than to draw her to love who hates you. Remember how you did ſollicit my humble State, and conſcious of my Meanneſs, yet paid a Veneration to my Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, which join'd with the honourable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my yielding to your Deſires, pronounce me free from ill Deſign or Diſhonour. Conſider theſe undeniable Truths: Have ſome Regard to your Honour! Remember you're a Chriſtian! Why ſhould you then make her Life end ſo miſerably, whoſe Beginning your Favour made ſo happy; If
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:54446:253"/>
I muſt not expect the Uſage and Reſpect of a Wife, let me but ſerve you as a Slave; ſo I belong to you, though in the meaneſt Rank, I never ſhall complain: Let me not be expos'd to the ſlandring Reflections of the Cenſorious World, by ſo cruel a Separation from my Lord: Afflict not the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Years of my poor Parents, whoſe faithful Services to you and yours have merited a more ſuitable Return. If you imagine the Current of your Noble Blood ſhould be defil'd by mixing with mine, conſider how many Noble Houſes have run in ſuch a Channel; beſides, the Woman's Side is not eſſentially requiſite to ennoble Deſcent! but chiefly think on this, that Virtue is the trueſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, which if you ſtain by baſely wronging me, you bring a greater Blot upon your Family than Marrying me could cauſe. In fine, my Lord, you cannot, muſt not diſown me for your Wife; to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt which Truth, I call your own Words, which muſt be true, if you prize your ſelf for Honour, and that Nobility, whoſe want you ſo deſpiſe in me; witneſs your Oaths and Vows, witneſs that Heaven which you ſo oft invok'd to ratify your Promiſes; and if all theſe ſhould fail, I make my laſt Appeal to your own Conſcience, whoſe Sting will always repreſent my Wrongs freſh to your Thoughts, and diſturb your Joys amidſt your greateſt Pleaſures.</p>
                           <p>Theſe, with many ſuch Arguments, did the mournful <hi>Dorothea</hi> urge, appearing ſo lovely in her Sorrow, that Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s Friends as well as all the reſt, ſympathiz'd with her; <hi>Lucinda</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, as much admiring her Wit and Beauty, as mov'd by the Tears, the piercing Sighs and Moans that follow'd her Entreaties; and ſhe would have gone nearer to have comforted her, had not <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi>'s Arms, that ſtill held her, prevented it. He
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:54446:253"/>
ſtood full of Confuſion, with his Eyes fix'd atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively on <hi>Dorothea</hi> a great while; at laſt opening his Arms, he quitted <hi>Lucinda,</hi> Thou haſt Conquer'd cry'd he, Charming <hi>Dorothea,</hi> thou haſt Conquer'd me, 'tis impoſſible to reſiſt ſo many united Truths and Charms. <hi>Lucinda</hi> was ſtill ſo diſorder'd and weak, that ſhe would have fall'n when <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> quitted her, had not <hi>Cardenio,</hi> without regard to his Safety, leap'd forward and caught her in his Arms, and embracing her with Eagerneſs and Joy; Thanks Gracious Heaven, cry'd he aloud, my dear, my faithful Wife, thy Sorrows now are ended; for where canſt thou reſt more ſafe than in my Arms, which now ſupport thee, as once they did when my bleſs'd Fortune firſt made thee mine. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinda</hi> then opening her Eyes, and finding her ſelf in the Arms of her <hi>Cardenio,</hi> without regard to Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony or Decency, threw her Arms about his Neck, and laying her Face to his, Yes, ſaid ſhe, thou art he, thou art my Lord indeed! 'Tis even you your ſelf, the right Owner of this poor har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs'd Captive. Now Fortune act thy worſt, nor Fears nor Threats ſhall ever part me more, from the ſole Support and Comfort of my Life. This Sight was very ſurprizing to Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and the other Spectators. <hi>Dorothea</hi> perceiving by Don <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi>'s Change of Countenance, and laying his Hand to his Sword, that he prepar'd to aſſault <hi>Cardenio,</hi> fell ſuddenly on her Knees; and with an endearing Embrace, held Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s Legs ſo faſt, that he could not ſtir. What means, cry'd ſhe, all in Tears, the only Refuge of my Hope? ſee here thy own and deareſt Wife at thy Feet, and her you would enjoy in her true Husband's Arms. Think then, my Lord, how unjuſt is your Attempt, to diſſolve that Knot which Heaven has ty'd ſo faſt. Can you e'er think or hope Succeſs in your Deſign
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:54446:254"/>
on her, who, contemning all Dangers, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd in ſtricteſt Conſtancy and Honour, before your Face lies bath'd in Tears of Joy and Paſſion in her true Lover's Boſom. For Heaven's ſake I intreat you, by your own Words I conjure you to mitigate your Anger, and permit that faithful Pair to conſummate their Joys, and ſpend their remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Days in Peace: Thus may you make it appear that you are Generous and truly Noble, giving the World ſo ſtrong a Proof that you have your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at Command, and your Paſſion in Subjection. All this while, <hi>Cardenio,</hi> though he ſtill held <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinda</hi> in his Arms, had a watchful Eye on Don <hi>Ferdinand;</hi> reſolving, if he had made the leaſt Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to his Prejudice, to make him repent it and all his Party, if poſſible, though at the Expence of his Life. But Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s Friends, the Curate, the Barber, and all the Company, (not forgetting ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt <hi>Sancho Pança</hi>) got together about Don <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and entreated him to pity the Beautiful <hi>Dorothea</hi>'s Tears; that conſidering what ſhe had ſaid, the Truth of which was apparent, it would be the higheſt Injuſtice to fruſtrate her lawful Hopes; that their ſtrange and wonderful meeting could not be attributed to Chance, but the peculiar and directing Providence of Heaven; that nothing, (as Mr. Curate very well urg'd) but Death could part <hi>Cardenio</hi> from <hi>Lucinda;</hi> and that tho' the Edge of the Sword might ſeparate them, he would make them happier by Death than he could hope to be by ſurviving; that in irrecoverable Accidents, a Submiſſion to Fate, and a Reſignation of our Wills, ſhew'd not only the greateſt Prudence, but alſo the higheſt Courage and Generoſity; that he ſhould not envy thoſe happy Lovers what the Bounty of Heaven had conferred on them, but that he ſhould turn his Eyes on <hi>Dorothea</hi>'s Grief, view her incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:54446:254"/>
Beauty, which, with her true and unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Love, made large Amends for the Meanneſs of her Parentage; but Principally it lay upon him, if he glory'd in the Titles of Nobility and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, to keep his Promiſe unviolated: That the more reaſonable Part of Mankind could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be ſatisfi'd, or have any eſteem for him: Alſo that it was the ſpecial Prerogative of Beauty (if heightn'd by Virtue, and adorn'd with Modeſty) to lay claim to any Dignity, without Diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Scandal to the Perſon that raiſes it; and that the ſtrong Dictates of Delight having been once indulg'd, we are not to be blam'd for follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them afterwards, provided they be not unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. In ſhort, To theſe Reaſons they added ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny enforcing Arguments, that Don <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who was truly a Gentleman, could no longer reſiſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but ſtoop'd down, and embracing <hi>Dorothea,</hi> Riſe, Madam, ſaid he, 'tis not proper that ſhe ſhould lie proſtrate at my Feet who triumphs over my Soul: If I have not hitherto paid you all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect I ought, 'twas perhaps ſo order'd by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that having by this a ſtronger conviction of your Conſtancy and Goodneſs, I may henceforth ſet the greater value on your Merit: Let the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Reſpects and Services I ſhall pay you, plead a Pardon for my paſt Tranſgreſſions; and let the violent Paſſions of my Love, that firſt made me yours, be an excuſe for that which caus'd me to forſake you: View the happy <hi>Lucinda</hi>'s Eyes, and there read a thouſand farther Excuſes; but I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe henceforth never to diſturb her Quiet; and may ſhe live long and contented with her dear <hi>Cardenio;</hi> as I hope to do with my deareſt <hi>Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea.</hi> Thus concluding, he embrac'd her again ſo lovingly, that it was with no ſmall difficulty that he kept in his Tears, which he endeavour'd
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:54446:255"/>
to conceal, being aſham'd to diſcover ſo Effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate a proof of his Remorſe.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Cardenio, Lucinda,</hi> and the greateſt part of the Company could not ſo well command their Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but all wept for joy; even <hi>Sancho Pança</hi> himſelf ſhed Tears, though, as he afterwards confeſs'd, it was not for downright Grief, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he found not <hi>Dorothea</hi> to be the Queen of <hi>Micomicona,</hi> as he ſuppos'd, and of whom he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſo many Favours and Preferments. <hi>Cardenio</hi> and <hi>Lucinda</hi> fell at Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s Feet, giving him thanks, with the ſtrongeſt expreſſions which Gratitude could ſuggeſt; he rais'd them up, and receiv'd their Acknowledgments with much Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty; then begg'd to be inform'd by <hi>Dorothea,</hi> how ſhe came to that Place. She related to him all ſhe had told <hi>Cardenio,</hi> but with ſuch a Grace, that what were miſ-fortunes to her, prov'd an unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pleaſure to thoſe that heard her Relation. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> told all that had befall'n him in the City, after he found the Paper in <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinda</hi>'s Boſom, which declar'd <hi>Cardenio</hi> to be her Husband; how he would have kill'd her, had not her Parents prevented him; how afterwards, mad with Shame and Anger, he left the City, to wait a more commodious Opportunity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; how in a ſhort time he learnt that <hi>Lucinda</hi> was fled to a Monaſtery, reſolving to end her Days there, if ſhe could not ſpend them with <hi>Cardenio;</hi> that, having deſir'd thoſe three Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to go with him, they went to the Monaſtery, and waiting till they found the Gate open, he left two of the Gentlemen to ſecure the Door, while he with the other enter'd the Houſe, where they found <hi>Lucinda,</hi> talking with a Nun in the Cloiſter; they forcibly brought her thence to a Village, where they diſguis'd themſelves, for
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:54446:255"/>
their more convenient flight, which they more eaſily brought about, the Monaſtery being ſituate in the Fields, diſtant a good way from any Town. He likewiſe added, how <hi>Lucinda</hi> finding her ſelf in his Power, fell in a Swoon, and that after ſhe came to her ſelf, ſhe continually wept and ſigh'd, but would not ſpeak a Syllable; and that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd with Silence only and Tears, they had Travell'd, till they came to the Inn, which prov'd to him as his arrival at Heaven, having put a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py concluſion to all his earthly Misfortunes.</p>

                           <p>I hope your early riſing will do you no hurt, ſaid he, Sir Knight of the woful Figure; but you may now ſleep on till Doom's-day if you will; nor need you trouble your head any longer about killing any Gyant, or reſtoring the Princeſs, for all that is done to your hand. That's more than probable, anſwer'd the Knight, for I have had the moſt extraordinary and prodigious engagement with the Giant, that I ever did, or ſhall maintain during the whole Courſe of my Life; yes, with one croſs ſtroke I laid his Head thwack on the Ground, whence the great effuſion of Blood ſeem'd like a violent ſtream of Water. Of Wine you mean, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> for you muſt know (if you know it not already) that your Worſhip's dead Giant is a broach'd Wine-bag, and the Blood ſome thirty Gallons of Tent which it held in its Belly, and your Head ſo cleverly ſtruck off, is the Whore my Mother; and ſo the Devil take both Giant and Head, and altogether, for <hi>Sancho.</hi> What ſay'ſt thou, mad Man, ſaid the Don, thou'rt frantick ſure. Riſe, riſe, Sir, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> and ſee what fine Work you have cut out for your ſelf; here's the Devil-and-all to pay for, and your great Queen is chang'd into a private Gentle-woman, call'd <hi>Dorothea,</hi> with ſome other ſuch odd Matters, that you will wonder with a Vengeance. I can wonder at nothing here, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> where you may remember I told you all things are rul'd by Inchantment. I believe it, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> had
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:54446:256"/>
my toſſing in a Blanket been of that kind; but ſure 'twas the likeſt a toſſing in a Blanket of any think I ever knew in my Life. And this ſame Inn-keeper, I remember very well, was one of thoſe that toſs'd me into the Air, and as cleverly and heartily he did it as a Man could wiſh, I'll ſay that for him; ſo that after all, I begin to ſmell a Rat, and do per'louſly ſuſpect, that all our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments will end in nothing but Bruiſes and broken Bones. Heaven will retrieve all, ſaid the Knight; I will therefore dreſs and march to the diſcovery of theſe wonderful transformations. While <hi>Sancho</hi> made him ready, the Curate gave Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and the reſt an account of Don <hi>Quixot</hi>'s Madneſs, and of the device he uſed to draw him from the <hi>Poor Rock,</hi> to which the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd diſdain of his Miſtreſs had baniſht him in Imagination. <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Adventure made alſo a part in the Story, which prov'd very diverting to the Strangers. He added, that ſince <hi>Dorothea</hi>'s change of Fortune had baulkt their deſign that way, ſome other trick ſhould be found to decoy him home: <hi>Cardenio</hi> offer'd his Service in the Affair, and that <hi>Lucinda</hi> ſhould perſonate <hi>Dorothea:</hi> No, no, (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd Don <hi>Ferdinand,) Dorothea</hi> ſhall humour the Jeſt ſtill, if this honeſt Gentleman's Habitation be not very far off. Only two days Journey ſaid the Curate; I would ride twice as far (ſaid Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi>) for the pleaſure of ſo good and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table an Action. By this Don <hi>Quixote</hi> had Sally'd out Arm'd Cap-a-pee, <hi>Mambrino</hi>'s Helmet, (with a great Hole in it,) on his Head; his Shield on his left Arm, and with his right he lean'd on his Lance. The dun Complexion of his meagre and weather-beaten Face, the unaccountable medley of his unſuitable Arms, together with his grave and ſolemn Port, ſtruck Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:54446:257"/>
dumb with Admiration, while the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion caſting his Eyes on <hi>Dorothea,</hi> with great Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and Solidity, broke ſilence with theſe Words.</p>
                           <p>I am inform'd by this my Squire, beautiful Lady, that your Greatneſs is annihilated, and your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty reduc'd to nothing; for of a Queen and mighty Princeſs, as you us'd to be, you are become a private Damſel. If any expreſs Order from the Negromantic King your Father (doubting the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Succeſs of my Arm in the reinſtating you) has occaſion'd this change, I muſt tell him, that he is no Conjurer in theſe Matters; nor is he skill'd in the Revolutions of Chivalry: For had he been converſant in the Study of Knight-Erran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try as I have been, he might have found, that in every Age, Champions of leſs Fame than Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> have finiſh'd more deſperate Adventures; ſince the killing of a pitiful Giant, how Arrogant ſoever he may be, is no ſuch great Atchievement; for, not many Hours paſt, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter'd one my ſelf; the Succeſs I will not mention, leſt the Incredulity of ſome People might diſtruſt the reality; but Time, the diſcoverer of all things, will diſcloſe it, when we leaſt expect. Hold there, ſaid the Hoſt, 'twas with two Wine-bags, but no Giant that you fought. Don <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> ſilenc'd the Inn-keeper, and bid him by no means interrupt Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> who thus went on. To conclude, moſt High and Diſinherited Lady, if your Father for the Cauſes already mention'd, has caus'd this Metamorphoſis in your Perſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him not; for there is no Peril on Earth, thro' which my Sword ſhall not open a way; and aſſure your ſelf, that in a few Days, by the overthrow of your Enemy's Head, it ſhall ſix on yours that Crown, which is your lawful Inheritance. Here Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ſtopt, waiting the Princeſs's Anſwer;
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:54446:257"/>
ſhe aſſur'd of Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s Conſent to carry on the Jeſt, till Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was carry'd home, and aſſuming a Face of Gravity, Whoſoever (anſwer'd ſhe) has inform'd you, Valorous Knight of the woful Figure, that I have alter'd or chang'd my Condition, has impos'd upon you; for I am juſt the ſame to Day as Yeſterday; 'tis true ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected, but fortunate Accidents have vary'd ſome circumſtances of my Fortune, much to my Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and far beyond my Hopes; but I am neither chang'd in my Perſon, nor alter'd in my Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of imploying the Force of your redoubtable and invincible Arm in my Favour. I therefore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply my ſelf to your uſual Generoſity; to have thoſe Words ſpoken to my Father's Diſhonour recall'd; and believe theſe eaſie and infallible means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs my Wrongs, the pure effects of his Wiſdom and Policy; as the good Fortune I now enjoy, has been the conſequence of your ſurprizing Deeds, as this Noble preſence can teſtify; what ſhould hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us then from ſetting forward to morrow Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, depending for a happy and ſucceſsful conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, on the Will of Heaven, and the Power of your unparallell'd Courage.</p>
                           <p>The ingenious <hi>Dorothea</hi> having concluded, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> turning to <hi>Sancho,</hi> with all the Signs of Fury imaginable; now muſt I tell thee, poor paul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try hangdog (ſaid he) thou art the veryeſt Raſcal in all <hi>Spain;</hi> tell me, Rogue, Scoundrel, did not you juſt now inform me, that this Princeſs was changed into a little private Damſel, call'd <hi>Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea;</hi> and the Head which I lopp'd from the Giant's Shoulders, was the Whore your Mother, with a thouſand other Abſurdities: Now by all the Powers of Heaven, (looking up, and grinding his Teeth together) I have a mind ſo to uſe thee, as to make thee appear a miſerable example to all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:54446:258"/>
Squires, that ſhall dare to tell a Knight-Errant a Lie. Good your Worſhip, cry'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> have patience, I beſeech you: Mayhap I am miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken or ſo, about my Lady Princeſs <hi>Micomicona</hi>'s Concern there; but that the Giant's Head came off the Wine-bags Shoulders, and that the Blood was as good Tent as ever was tipt over Tongue, I'll take my corporal Oath on't; Gadzookers Sir, are not the Baggs all hack'd and ſlaſh'd within there at your Bed's-head, and the Wine all in a puddle in your Chamber? But you'll gueſs at the Meat preſently by the Sauce; the proof o' the Pudding is in the eating, Maſter; and if my Land-lord here don't let you know it to your coſt, he's a very honeſt and civil Fellow, that's all. <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid the Don, I pronounce thee <hi>non Compos,</hi> I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pardon thee, and have done. 'Tis enough, ſaid Don <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> we therefore in purſuance of the Princeſs's Orders will this Night refreſh our ſelves, and to morrow's Sun ſets us out to attend the Lord Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> in proſecution of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Enterprize he has undertaken, being all impatient to be Eye-witneſſes of his celebrated and matchleſs Courage. I ſhall be proud of the honour of ſerving and waiting upon you, my good Lord, reply'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and reckon my ſelf infinitely oblig'd by the favour and good opinion of ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable a Company; which I ſhall endeavour to improve and confirm, though at the expence of the laſt drop of my Blood.</p>
                           <p>Many other Compliments had paſs'd between Don <hi>Quixote</hi> and Don <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> when the arrival of a Stranger interrupted them. His Dreſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented him a Chriſtian newly return'd from <hi>Barbary:</hi> He was clad in a ſhort-skirted Coat of blue Cloath, with ſhort Sleeves and no Collar, his Breeches were of blue Linnen, with a Cap of the
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:54446:258"/>
ſame Colour, a pair of Date-colour'd Stockings, and a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Scimitar hung by a Scarf, in manner of a Shoulder-Belt. There rid a Woman in his Company, clad in a <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Dreſs, with her Face cover'd by her Veil; ſhe had on a little Cap of Gold-Tiſſue, and a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Mantle that reach'd from her Shoulders to her Feet. The Man was well ſhap'd and ſtrong, his Age about Forty, his Face ſomewhat Tann'd, his Muſtachoes long, and his Beard handſome: In ſhort, his Genteel mien and Perſon were too diſtinguiſhable, to let the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman be hid by the meanneſs of his Habit. He call'd preſently for a Room, and being anſwer'd that all were full, ſeem'd a little troubl'd; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he went to the Woman who came along with him, and took her down from her Aſs. The Ladies being all ſurpriz'd at the oddneſs of the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Dreſs, had the curioſity to flock about the Stranger, and <hi>Dorothea</hi> very diſcreetly imagining that both ſhe and her Conductor were tir'd, and took it ill that they could not have a Chamber; I hope, Madam, you will bear your ill Fortune patiently, ſaid ſhe, for want of room is an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience incident to all publick Inns: But if you pleaſe, Madam, to favour us with your Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, you may perhaps find that you have met with worſe Entertainment on the Road, than what this place affords. The unknown Lady made her no anſwer, but riſing up, laid her hands acroſs her Breaſt, bow'd her Head and bended her Body, as a ſign that ſhe acknowledg'd the Favour. By her ſilence they conjectur'd her to be undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <hi>Moor,</hi> and that ſhe could not ſpeak <hi>Spaniſh.</hi> Her Companion was now come back from the Stable, and told them; Ladies, I hope you will excuſe this Gentlewoman from anſwering any Queſtions, for ſhe is very much a ſtranger to our Language. We are only, Sir, anſwer'd <hi>Lucinda,</hi>
                              <pb n="468" facs="tcp:54446:259"/>
making her an offer, which Civility obliges us to make all Strangers, eſpecially of our own Sex; that ſhe would make us happy in her Company all Night, and fare as we do; we will make very much of her, Sir, and ſhe ſhall want for nothing that the Houſe affords. I return you humble thanks, dear Madam, anſwer'd the Stranger, in the Lady's behalf and my own; and I infinitely prize the favour which the preſent exigence, and the worth of the Donors, make doubly engaging. Is the Lady, pray Sir, a Chriſtian or a <hi>Moor,</hi> ask'd <hi>Dorothea?</hi> Our Charity would make us hope ſhe were the former; but by her attire and ſilence we are afraid ſhe is the latter. Outwardly, Madam, anſwers he, ſhe appears and is a <hi>Moor,</hi> but in her heart a zealous Chriſtian, which her longing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of being Baptiz'd have expreſly teſtifiy'd. I have had no opportunity of having her Chriſten'd ſince ſhe left <hi>Algiers,</hi> which was her Habitation and Native Country; nor has any imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of death oblig'd her to be brought to the Font, till ſhe be better inſtructed in the Principles of our Religion; but, I hope, by Heavens aſſiſtance, to have her ſhortly Baptiz'd with decency ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Quality, which is much above what her Equipage or mine ſeem to promiſe.</p>
                           <p>Theſe words rais'd in them all a Curioſity to be farther inform'd who the <hi>Moor</hi> and her Conductor were; but they thought it improper then to put them to any more particular relation of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, becauſe they wanted reſt and refreſhment after their Journey. <hi>Dorothea</hi> placing the Lady by her, begg'd her to take off her Veil. She look'd on her Companion, as if ſhe requir'd him to let her know what ſhe ſaid; which, when he had let her underſtand in the <hi>Arabian</hi> Tongue, joyning his own requeſt alſo, ſhe diſcover'd ſo charming a
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:54446:259"/>
Face, that <hi>Dorothea</hi> imagin'd her more Beautiful than <hi>Lucinda;</hi> ſhe on the other hand, fancy'd her handſomer than <hi>Dorothea;</hi> and moſt of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny believ'd her more Beautiful than both of 'em. As Beauty has always a Prerogative, or rather Charm, to attract Mens inclinations, the whole Company dedicated their deſires to ſerve the love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Moor.</hi> Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ask'd the Stranger her Name, he anſwer'd <hi>Lela Zoraida;</hi> ſhe heard him, and gueſſing what they ask'd, ſuddenly reply'd with great concern, though very gracefully, No, no <hi>Zoraida, Maria, Maria;</hi> giving them to underſtand, that her Name was <hi>Maria</hi> and not <hi>Zoraida.</hi> Theſe Words, ſpoken with ſo much eagerneſs, rais'd a concern in every Body, the Ladies eſpecially, whoſe natural tenderneſs ſhew'd it ſelf by their Tears; and <hi>Lucinda</hi> embracing her very lovingly, Ay, ay, ſaid ſhe, <hi>Maria, Maria,</hi> which words the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Lady repeated by way of Anſwer. <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raida Macange,</hi> added ſhe; as much as to ſay, <hi>not Zoraida.</hi> The Night coming on, and the Inn-keeper by order of Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s Friends, having made haſte to provide them the beſt Supper he could, the Cloath was laid on a long Table, there being neither round nor ſquare in the Houſe. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> after much Ceremony, was prevail'd upon to ſit at the Head, he deſir'd the Lady <hi>Mico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micona</hi> to ſit next to him, and the reſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany having plac'd themſelves according to their Rank and Convenience, they eat their Supper very plentifully. Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> to raiſe the diverſion, never minded his Meat, but inſpir'd with the ſame Spirit that mov'd him to preach ſo much to the Goat-herds, he began to hold forth in this manner. Certainly, Gentlemen, if we rightly conſider it, thoſe who make Knight-Errantry their Profeſſion, often meet with moſt ſurprizing and ſtupendous
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:54446:260"/>
Adventures. For what Mortal in the World, at this time entring within this Caſtle, and ſeeing us ſit together as we do, will imagine and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve us to be the ſame Perſons which in reality we are? Who is there that can judge, that this Lady by my ſide, is the Great Queen we all know her to be, and that I am that Knight of the woefol Figure ſo univerſally made known by Fame? It is then no longer to be doubted, but that this Exerciſe and Profeſſion ſurpaſſes all others that have been invented by Man, and is ſo much the more honourable, as it is more expos'd to Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. Let none preſume to tell me that the Pen is preferable to the Sword; for be they who they will, I ſhall tell them they know not what they ſay. For the reaſon they give, and on which chiefly they rely, is, that the labour of the Mind exceeds that of the Body, and that the Exerciſe of Arms depends only on the Body; as if the uſe of them were the Buſineſs of Porters, which requires nothing but much ſtrength. Or as if this, which we who profeſs it call Chivalry, did not include the Acts of Fortitude, which depend very much upon the Underſtanding. Or elſe, as if that Warriour, who Commands an Army, or defends a City beſieg'd, did not labour as much with the Mind as with the Body. If this be not ſo, let Experience teach us, whether it be poſſible by bodily ſtrength to diſcover or gueſs the intentions of an Enemy. The forming Deſigns, laying of Stratagems, overcoming of Difficulties, and ſhunning of Dangers, are all Works of the Underſtanding, wherein the Body has no ſhare. It being therefore evident, that the Exerciſe of Arms requires the help of the Mind as well as Learning, let us ſee in the next place, whether the Scholar or the Soldier's Mind undergoes the
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:54446:260"/>
greateſt labour. Now this may be the better known, by regarding the End and Object each of them aims at; for that intention is to be moſt valu'd, which makes the nobleſt end its Object. The ſcope and end of Learning, I mean, humane Learning, (in this place I ſpeak not of Divinity, whoſe aim is to guide Souls to Heaven, for no other can equal a deſign ſo infinite as this) is to give a perfection to diſtributive Juſtice, beſtowing upon every one his due, and to procure and cauſe good Laws to be obſerv'd; an End really Generous, Great, and worthy of high Commendation; but yet not equal to that which Knight-Errantry tends to, whoſe Object and End is Peace, which is the greateſt bleſſing Men can wiſh for in this Life. And therefore the firſt good News the World re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, were thoſe the Angels brought that Night, which was the beginning of our Day, when they ſang in the Air, Glory on high, and Peace upon Earth to Men of Good Will. And the only man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Salutation taught by the beſt Maſter in Heaven or upon Earth to his Friends and Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, was, that entring any Houſe they ſhould ſay, Peace be in this Houſe. And at other times he ſaid to them, My Peace I give to you, My Peace I leave to you, Peace be among you. A Jewel and Legacy worthy of ſuch a Donor, a Jewel ſo Precious, that without it there can be no happineſs either in Earth or Heaven. This Peace is the true end of War; for Arms and War are one and the ſame thing. Allowing then this Truth, that the End of War is Peace, and that in this it excells the End of Learning, let us now weigh the Bodily labours the Scholar undergoes, againſt thoſe the Warriour ſuffers; and then ſee which are greateſt. The Method and Language Don <hi>Quixote</hi> us'd in delivering himſelf were ſuch, that none of his Hearers at that time look'd upon
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:54446:261"/>
him as a Madman. But on the contrary, moſt of them being Gentlemen, to whom the uſe of Arms properly appertains, they gave him a willing At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; and he proceeded in this manner. Theſe, then, I ſay, are the ſufferings and hardſhips a Scholar endures. Firſt, Poverty, (not that they are all Poor, but to urge the worſt that may be in this caſe;) and having ſaid he endures Poverty, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks nothing more need be urg'd to expreſs his Miſery; for he that is poor enjoys no happineſs, but labours under this Poverty in all its parts, at one time in Hunger, at another in Cold, another in Nakedneſs, and ſometimes in all of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; yet his Poverty is not ſo great, but ſtill he Eats, though it be later than the uſual Hour, and of the ſcraps of the Rich, which is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of a Scholar's Misfortunes; neither can the Learned wholly want another Man's Fire or Chimney-corner, where, though they be not thoroughly heated, yet they gather warmth, and at laſt they lie at Night under Covert. I will not touch upon other leſs material Circumſtances, as the want of Linnen, and ſcarcity of Shooes, the thinneſs and baldneſs of their Cloaths, and their Surfeiting when good Fortune throws a Feaſt in their way. This is the difficult and uncouth path they tread, often ſtumbling and falling, yet riſing again and puſhing on, till they attain the Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they aim at; whither being arriv'd, we have ſeen many of them, who having been carry'd by a Fortunate Gale through all theſe Quick-ſands, from a Chair Govern the World; their Hunger being chang'd into Satiety, their Cold into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Warmth, their Nakedneſs into Magnificence of Apparel; and the Mat they us'd to lie upon, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſtately Beds of coſtly Silks and ſofteſt Linnen, a Reward due to their Virtue. But yet their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:54446:261"/>
being compar'd with thoſe the Soldier en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures, appear much inferiour, as I ſhall in the next place make out.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> A Continuation of Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s curious Diſcourſe upon Arms and Learning.</head>
                           <p>SInce, ſpeaking of the Scholar, we began by his Poverty, and its ſeveral parts, continu'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> let us now obſerve whether the Soldier be any thing richer than he; and we ſhall find that Poverty it ſelf is not poorer; for he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on his miſerable Pay, which he receives but ſeldom, or perhaps never; or elſe in that he makes by Marauding, with the hazard of his Life, and trouble of his Conſcience. Such is ſometimes his want of Apparel, that a ſlaſh'd Buff-Coat is all his Holiday Rayment and Shirt; and in the depth of Winter, being in the open Field, he has nothing to cheriſh him againſt the ſharpneſs of the Seaſon, but the breath of his Mouth, which iſſuing from an empty place, I am perſwaded is it ſelf cold, though contrary to the Rules of Nature. But now ſee how he expects Night to make amends for all theſe hardſhips in the Bed prepar'd for him, which, unleſs it be his own fault, never proves too narrow; for he may freely lay out as much of the ground as he pleaſes, and tumble to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, without danger of loſing the Sheets. But above all, when the day ſhall come, wherein be is to put in practice the Exerciſe of his Profeſſion,
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:54446:262"/>
and ſtrive to gain ſome new degree, when the day of Battel ſhall come, then as a Mark of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ſhall his Head be dignify'd with a Cap made of Lint, to ſtop a hole made by a Bullet, or he perhaps carry'd off maim'd, at the expence of a Leg or an Arm. And if this do not happen, but that merciful Heaven preſerve his Life and Limbs, it may fall out that he ſhall remain as poor as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and muſt run through many Rencounters and Battles, and always come off Victorious, to obtain ſome little Preferment; and theſe Miracles too are rare: But, I pray tell me, Gentlemen, if ever you made it your Obſervation, how few are thoſe who obtain due rewards in War, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of thoſe Numbers that Periſh? Doubtleſs you will anſwer, that there is no parity between them; that the ſlain are without number, that three numeral Figures will ſerve to make the ſum of thoſe that live to be rewarded. It is quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with Scholars, not only thoſe who follow the Law, but others alſo, who all either by hook or by crook get a livelihood, ſo that though the Soldier's Sufferings be much greater, yet his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is much leſs. To this it may be anſwer'd, that it is eaſier to reward two thouſand Scholars, than thirty thouſand Soldiers, becauſe the former are recompenc'd at the Expence of the Publick, by giving them Employments, which of neceſſity muſt be beſtow'd on thoſe of their Profeſſion, but the latter cannot be gratify'd otherwiſe than at the Coſt of the Maſter that employs them; yet this very difficulty makes good my Argument. But let us lay this Matter aſide, as a Point diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be decided, and let us return to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference due to Arms above Learning, a Subject as yet in Debate, each Party bringing ſtronger Reaſons to make out their Pretenſions. Among
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:54446:262"/>
others, Learning urges, that without it Warfare it ſelf could not ſubſiſt; becauſe War, as other things, has its Laws, and is Govern'd by them, and Laws are the Province of Learning and Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. To this Objection the Soldiers make An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that without them the Laws cannot be maintain'd, for it is by Arms that Common-wealths are defended, Kingdoms ſupported, Cities ſecur'd, the High-ways made ſafe, and the Sea deliver'd from Pyrates. In ſhort, were it not for them, Common-wealths, Kingdoms, Monarchies, Cities, the Roads by Land, and the Waters of the Sea, would be ſubject to the Ravages and Confuſion that attends War while it laſts and is at liberty to make uſe of its unbounded priviledges and ſtrength. Beſides, it is paſt all Controverſie, that what coſts deareſt, is, and ought moſt to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu'd. Now for a Man to attain to an eminent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in Learning, coſts him time, watching, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, nakedneſs, dizzineſs in the Head, weakneſs in the Stomach, and other inconveniences, which are the conſequences of theſe, of which I have already in part made mention But the riſing gradually to be a good Soldier, is purchas'd at the whole expence of all that is requir'd for Learning, and that in ſo ſurpaſſing a degree, that there is no compariſon betwixt them; becauſe he is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very moment in danger of his Life. To what danger or diſtreſs can a Scholar be reduc'd equal to that of a Soldier, who, being Beſieg'd in ſome ſtrong place, and at his poſt, or upon Guard, in ſome Ravelin or Baſtion, perceives the Enemy carrying on a Mine under him, and yet muſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no account remove from thence, or ſhun the danger which threatens him ſo near? All he can do is to give Advice to his Commander, that he may countermine; and he muſt ſtand ſtill fearing
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:54446:263"/>
and expecting when on a ſudden he ſhall ſoar to the Clouds without Wings, and be again caſt down headlong againſt his Will. If this danger ſeem inconſiderable, let us ſee whether that be not greater when two Galleys ſhock one another with their Prows, in the midſt of the ſpacious Sea. When they have thus grappl'd, and are clinging together, the Soldier is confin'd to the narrow Beak, being a Board not above two Foot wide; and yet though he ſees before him ſo many Miniſters of Death threatning, as there are Pieces of Cannon on the other ſide pointed againſt him, and not half a Pike's length from his Body, and being ſenſible that the firſt ſlip of his Feet ſends him to the bottom of <hi>Neptune</hi>'s Dominions, ſtill, for all this, inſpir'd by Honour, with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted Heart, he ſtands a mark to ſo much Fire, and endeavours to make his way by that nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row paſſage into the Enemy's Veſſel. But what is moſt to be admir'd is, that no ſooner one falls, where he ſhall never riſe till the end of the World, than another ſteps into the ſame place; and if he alſo drops into the Sea, which lies in wait for him like an Enemy, another, and after him another ſtill fills up the place, without ſuffering any interval of time to ſeparate their Deaths; a reſolution and boldneſs ſcarce to be parallel'd in any other Tryals of War. Bleſſed be thoſe happy Ages that were ſtrangers to the dreadful fury of theſe deviliſh Inſtruments of Artillery, whoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventor I am ſatisfy'd is now in Hell, receiving the reward of his curſed Invention, which is the cauſe that very often a Cowardly baſe hand takes away the Life of the braveſt Gentleman; and that in the midſt of that vigour and reſolution which animates and inflames the bold, a chance Bullet (ſhot perhaps by one that fled, and was frighted
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:54446:263"/>
at the very flaſh the miſchievous Piece gave, when it went off,) coming, no body knows how, or from whence, in a Moment puts a period to the brave deſigns, and the life of one, that deſerv'd to have ſurviv'd many Years. This conſider'd I could almoſt ſay, I am ſorry at my Heart for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken upon me this Profeſſion of a Knight-Errant, in ſo deteſtable an Age; for tho' no Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger daunts me, yet it affects me to think, whether Powder and Lead may not deprive me of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of becoming Famous, and making my ſelf known throughout the World, by the ſtrength of my Arm, and dint of my Sword. But let Heav'n order Matters as it pleaſes, for if I compaſs my Deſigns, I ſhall be ſo much the more Honour'd, by how much the Dangers I have expos'd my ſelf to, are greater than thoſe the Knights-Errant of former Ages eſcap'd. All this long preamble Don <hi>Quixote</hi> made, whilſt the Company Supp'd, never minding to eat a mouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, though <hi>Sancho Pança</hi> had ſeveral times advis'd him to Sup, telling him there would be time enough afterwards to ſay what he thought fit. Thoſe who heard him were afreſh mov'd with Compaſſion, to ſee a Man, who ſeem'd in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpects to have a ſound judgment and clear underſtanding, ſo abſolutely mad and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted, when any mention was made of his cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Knight-Errantry. The Curate told him, he was much in the right, in all he had ſaid for the honour of Arms, and that he, though a Scholar, and a Graduate, was of the ſame Opinion. Supper being ended, and the Cloath taken away, whilſt the Inn-keeper, his Wife, his Daughter, and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritornes,</hi> fitted up Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Loft for the Ladies, that they might lie by themſelves that Night, Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> entreated the Slave to give them an
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:54446:264"/>
Account of his Life; conſcious the Relation could not chooſe but be very delightful and ſurprizing, as might be gueſs'd by his coming with <hi>Zoraida.</hi> The Slave Anſwer'd, He would moſt willingly comply with their Deſires, and that he only fear'd the Relation would not give them all the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction he could wiſh, but that however, rather than diſobey, he would do it as well as he could. The Curate and all the Company thank'd him, and made freſh inſtances to the ſame Effect. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf courted by ſo many, There is no need of entreaties, ſaid he, for what you may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; therefore, continu'd he, give me your Attention, and you ſhall hear a true Relation, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not to be parallel'd by thoſe fabulous Stories which are compos'd with much Art and Study. This caus'd all the Company to ſeat themſelves, and obſerve a very ſtrict ſilence, and then with an agreeable and ſedate Voice, he began in this manner.</p>

                           <p>IN the Mountains of <hi>Leon</hi> my Family had its firſt Original, and was more kindly dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al by Nature than by Fortune, though my Father might paſs for Rich among the Inhabitants of thoſe Parts, who are but poorly provided for; to ſay truth, he had been ſo, had he had as much Induſtry to preſerve, as he had Inclination to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipate
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:54446:264"/>
his Income; but he had been a Soldier, and the Years of his Youth ſpent in that Employment, had left him in his Old-Age a propenſity to ſpend, under the Name of Liberality. War is a School where the Covetous grow free, and the free Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal: To ſee a Soldier a Miſer, is a kind of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy which happens but ſeldom. My Father was far from being one of them; for he paſs'd the Bounds of Liberality, and came very near the exceſſes of Prodigality: A thing which cannot ſuit well with a marry'd Life, where the Children ought to ſucceed to the Eſtate, as well as Name of the Family. We were three of us, all at Man's Eſtate, and my Father, finding that the only way (as he ſaid) to curb his ſquandring Inclination, was reſolv'd to diſpoſſeſs himſelf of that which main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd it, his Eſtate; without which <hi>Alexander</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf muſt have appear'd poor. He call'd us one day all three to him in his Chamber, and ſpoke to us in the following manner.</p>
                           <p>My Sons, to perſwade you that I love you, I need only tell you I am your Father, and you my Children; and on the other ſide, you have reaſon to think me unkind, conſidering how careleſs I am in preſerving what ſhould one Day be yours; but to convince you, however, that I have the Bowels of a Parent, I have taken a reſolution, which I have well weigh'd and conſider'd for many Days. You are all now of an Age to chooſe the kind of Life you each of you incline to, or at leaſt to enter upon ſome Employment that may one Day pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure you both Honour and Profit: Therefore I deſign to divide all I have into four Parts, of which I will give three among you, and retain the fourth for my ſelf, to maintain me in my Old Age, as long as it ſhall pleaſe Heaven to continue me in this Life. After that each of you ſhall have
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:54446:265"/>
receiv'd his part, I could wiſh you would follow one of the Employments I ſhall mention to you, every one as he finds himſelf inclin'd. There is a Proverb in our vulgar Tongue, which I take to contain a great deal of Truth, as generally thoſe ſorts of ſayings do; being ſhort Sentences fram'd upon Obſervation and long Experience. This Proverb runs thus, <hi>Either the Church, the Sea, or the Court.</hi> As if it ſhould plainly ſay, that whoever deſires to thrive, muſt follow one of theſe three; either be a Church-Man, or a Merchant and try his Fortune at Sea, or enter into the Service of his Prince in the Court: For another Proverb ſays, that <hi>King's Chaff is better than other Mens Corn.</hi> I ſay this, becauſe I would have one of you follow his Studies, another I deſire ſhould be a Merchant, and the third ſhould ſerve the King in his Wars; becauſe it is a thing of ſome difficulty to get an entrance at Court; and though War does not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately procure Riches, yet it ſeldom fails of giving Honour and Reputation. Within eight days time I will give each of you your Portion, and not wrong you of a farthing of it, as you ſhall ſee by Experience. Now therefore tell me if you are reſolv'd to follow my Advice about your ſetling into the World. And turning to me as the Eldeſt, he bid me Anſwer firſt. I told him, that he ought not upon our Account to divide, or leſſen his Eſtate, or way of Living; that we were young Men, and could ſhift in the World; and at laſt I concluded, that for my part I would be a Soldier, and ſerve God and the King in that Honourable Profeſſion. My ſecond Brother made the ſame regardful Offer, and choſe to go to the <hi>Indies;</hi> reſolving to lay out in Goods the ſhare that ſhould be given him here. The youngeſt, and I believe, the wiſeſt of us all, ſaid he would be
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:54446:265"/>
a Church-man; and in order to it go to <hi>Salamanca,</hi> and there finiſh his Studies. After this, my Father embrac'd us all three, and in a few days perform'd what he had promis'd, and, as I remember, it was three thouſand Ducats a piece, which he ſhar'd among us; for we had an Uncle who bought all the Eſtate, and paid for it in ready Money, that it might not go out of the Family. A little after, we all took leave of my Father, and at parting I could not forbear thinking it a kind of Inhumanity to leave the old Gentleman in ſo ſtreight a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: I prevail'd with him therefore to accept of two thouſand of my three, the remainder being ſufficient to make up a Soldier's Equipage. My Example work'd upon my other Brothers, and they each of them preſented him with a thouſand Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats; ſo that my Father remain'd with four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Ducats in ready Money, and three thouſand more in Land, which he choſe to keep, and not ſell out-right. To be ſhort, we took our laſt leave of my Father and the Uncle I have mention'd, not without much Grief and Tears on all ſides. They particularly recommendeding to us to let them know by all Opportunities our good or ill For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes: We promis'd ſo to do, and having receiv'd the Bleſſing of our old Father, one of us went ſtrait to <hi>Salamanca,</hi> the other to <hi>Sevill,</hi> and I to <hi>Alicant,</hi> where I was was inform'd of a <hi>Genoeſe</hi> Ship, which loaded Wool for <hi>Genoa.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This year makes two and twenty ſince I firſt left my Father's Houſe, and in all that time, tho' I have writ ſeveral Letters, I have not had the leaſt News either of him, or of my Brothers. And now I will relate in few Words my own Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in all that courſe of Years. I took Shipping at <hi>Alicant,</hi> arriv'd ſafe and with a good paſſage at <hi>Genova,</hi> from thence I went to <hi>Milan,</hi> where I
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:54446:266"/>
bought my Equipage, reſolving to go and enter my ſelf in the Army in <hi>Piedmont;</hi> but being come as far as <hi>Alexandria de la Paille,</hi> I was inform'd that the Great Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> was paſſing into <hi>Flanders</hi> with an Army; this made me alter my firſt Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. I follow'd him, and was preſent at all his Engagements, as well as at the Deaths of the Counts <hi>Egmont</hi> and <hi>Horne;</hi> and at laſt I had a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours under a famous Captain of <hi>Guadalajara,</hi> whoſe Name was <hi>Diego d' Urbina.</hi> Some time after my arrival in <hi>Flanders,</hi> there came News of the Holy League concluded by Pope <hi>Pius</hi> V. of happy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, in Conjunction with <hi>Spain,</hi> againſt the common Enemy the <hi>Turk,</hi> who at that time had taken the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus</hi> from the <hi>Venetians;</hi> which was an unfortunate and lamentable loſs to <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> It was alſo certain, that the General of this Holy League was the moſt Serene Don <hi>Juan</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> Natural Brother to our good King Don <hi>Philip.</hi> The great Fame of the Preparations for this War, incited me with a vehement deſire of being preſent at the Engagement which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to follow theſe Preparations; and although I had certain Aſſurance, and as it were an earneſt of my being Advanc'd to be a Captain upon the firſt vacancy, yet I reſolv'd to leave all thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, and return, as I did, to <hi>Italy.</hi> My good Fortune was ſuch, that I arriv'd juſt about the ſame time that Don <hi>Juan</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> landed at <hi>Genova,</hi> in order to go to <hi>Naples,</hi> and join the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet, as he did at <hi>Meſſina.</hi> In ſhort, I was at that great Action of the Battel of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> being a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Foot, to which poſt my good Fortune more than my Deſert had now advanc'd me; and that Day, which was ſo happy to all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the World was then diſabus'd of the Error they had entertain'd, that the <hi>Turk</hi> was Invincible
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:54446:266"/>
by Sea;) that Day I ſay, in which the Pride of the <hi>Ottomans</hi> was firſt broke, and which was ſo happy to all Chriſtians, even to thoſe who dy'd in the Fight, who were more ſo than thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd alive and Conquerors, I alone was the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Man; ſince, inſtead of a Naval Crown, which I might have hop'd for in the time of the <hi>Romans,</hi> I found my ſelf that very Night a Slave, with Irons on my Feet, and Manacles on my Hands. The thing happen'd thus: <hi>Vehali,</hi> King of <hi>Algiers,</hi> a brave and bold Pyrate, having boarded and taken the <hi>Capitana</hi> Galley of <hi>Malta,</hi> in which only three Knights were left alive, and thoſe deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately wounded, the Galley of <hi>John Andrea Doria</hi> made haſte to Succour them; in this Galley I was Embarqu'd with my Company, and doing my duty in this Occaſion, I leap'd into the Enemy's Galley, which getting looſe from ours, that intended to board the <hi>Algerine,</hi> my Soldiers were hindred from following me, and I remain'd alone among a great number of Enemies; whom not being able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, I was taken, after having receiv'd ſeveral Wounds; and as you have heard already, <hi>Vehali</hi> having eſcaped with all his Squadron, I found my ſelf his Priſoner; and was the only afflicted Man among ſo many joyful ones, and the only Captive among ſo many free; for on that Day above 15000 Chriſtians, who row'd in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Galleys, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd their long wiſh'd-for Liberty. I was carry'd to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where the Grand Signior <hi>Selim,</hi> made <hi>Vehali</hi> my Maſter General of the Sea, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving behaved himſelf very well in the Battle, and brought away with him the great Flag of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Malta,</hi> as a proof of his Valour.</p>
                           <p>The ſecond year of my Captivity, I was a Slave in the <hi>Capitana</hi> Galley at <hi>Navarrino;</hi> and I took notice of the Chriſtians Fault, in letting ſlip the
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:54446:267"/>
Opportunity they had of taking the whole <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Fleet in that Port; and all the <hi>Janifaries</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerine</hi> Pirates, did ſo expect to be attack'd, that they had all in readineſs to eſcape on Shore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Fighting, ſo great was the terror they had of our Fleet; but it pleas'd God to order it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe not by any fault of the Chriſtian General, but for the Sins of Chriſtendom, and becauſe it is his Will we ſhould always have ſome Enemies to Chaſtize us. <hi>Vehali</hi> ſav'd himſelf at <hi>Modon,</hi> which is an Iſland, not far from <hi>Navarrino,</hi> and theſe Landing his Men, fortify'd the Entrance of the Harbour, remaining in ſafety there till Don <hi>Juan</hi> was forc'd to return home with his Fleet. In this Expedition, the Galley call'd <hi>La Preſa,</hi> of which <hi>Barbaroſſa</hi>'s own Son was Captain, was taken by the Admiral Gally of <hi>Naples,</hi> call'd the <hi>Woolf,</hi> which was Commanded by that Thunderbolt of War, that Father of the Soldiers, that happy and never conquer'd Captain, Don <hi>Alvaro de Baçan,</hi> Marquis of <hi>Santa Cruz;</hi> and I cannot omit the manner of taking this Galley. The Son of <hi>Barbaroſſa</hi> was very cruel, and us'd his Slaves with great Inhumanity; they perceiving that the <hi>Woolf</hi>-Galley got of them in the Chace, all of a ſudden laid by their Oars, and ſeizing on their Commander, as he was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between them on the Deck, and calling to them to Row hard; they paſs'd him on from Hand to Hand to one another, from one end of the Galley to the other, and gave him ſuch Blows in the handing him, that before he got to the Main-Maſt, his Soul had left his Body, and was fled to Hell. This, as I ſaid, was the effect of his Cruelty, and their Hatred.</p>
                           <p>Afrer this, we return'd to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and the next Year, which was 1573, it was known how Don <hi>Juan</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> had taken <hi>Tunis</hi> and its King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:54446:267"/>
from the <hi>Turks,</hi> and given the Poſſeſſion of it to <hi>Muley Hamed,</hi> having thereby defeated all the hopes of Reigning of <hi>Muley Hamida,</hi> one of the cruelleſt and withal one of the braveſt <hi>Moors</hi> that was in the World. The Grand Signior was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bl'd at this loſs, and uſing his wonted Artifices with the Chriſtians, he ſtruck up a Peace with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who were much more deſirous than he of it.</p>
                           <p>The year after, which was 1574, he attack'd the <hi>Goletta,</hi> and the Fort which Don <hi>Juan</hi> had begun, but not above half finiſh'd, before <hi>Tunis.</hi> All this while I was a Galley-Slave, without any hopes of Liberty; at leaſt I could not promiſe my ſelf to obtain it by way of Ranſome; for I was reſolv'd not to write my Father the News of my Misfortune. <hi>La Goletta</hi> and the Fort were both taken after ſome Reſiſtance; the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of 75000 <hi>Turks</hi> in Pay, and above 400000 <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Arabs</hi> out of all <hi>Africa</hi> near the Sea; with ſuch Proviſions of War of all kinds, and ſo many Pioneers, that they might have cover'd the <hi>Goletta</hi> and the Fort with Earth by Handfuls. The <hi>Goletta</hi> was firſt taken, though always before repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted impregnable; and it was not loſt by any fault of its Defenders, who did all that could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from them, but becauſe it was found by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that it was practicable to make Trenches in that Sandy Soil, which was thought to have Water under it within two Foot, and the <hi>Turks</hi> digg'd above two Yards before they came at any, by which means filling Sacks with Sand, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them on one another, they rais'd them ſo high, that they commanded from that Fortification the Fort, in which none could be ſafe, nor ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the Walls. It has been the Opinion of moſt Men, that we did ill to ſhut our ſelves
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:54446:268"/>
up in the <hi>Goletta;</hi> and that we ought to have been drawn out to hinder their Landing; but they who ſay ſo, talk without Experience, and at a diſtance, of ſuch things; for if in all there were not above 7000 Men in the <hi>Goletta</hi> and the Fort, how could ſo ſmall a Number, though never ſo brave, take the open Field againſt ſuch Forces as thoſe of the Enemies? And how is it poſſible that a Place can avoid being taken which can have no Relief, particularly being beſieg'd by ſuch Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and thoſe in their own Country: But it ſeem'd to many others, and that is alſo my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that God Almighty favour'd <hi>Spain</hi> moſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, in ſuffering that ſink of Iniquity and Miſery, as well as that Spunge and perpetual drain of Treaſure to be deſtroy'd. For infinite Sums of Money were ſpent there to no purpoſe, without any other deſign than to preſerve the Memory of one of the Emperor's, <hi>Charles</hi> the Vth's, Conqueſts; as if it had been neceſſary to ſupport the Eternity of his Glory, (which will be Permanent) that thoſe Stones ſhould remain in being. The Fort was likewiſe loſt, but the <hi>Turks</hi> got it Foot by Foot; for the Soldiers who defended it, ſuſtain'd two and twenty Aſſaults, and in them kill'd above 25000 of thoſe <hi>Barbarians;</hi> and when it was taken, of 300 which were left alive, there was not one Man unwounded; a certain ſign of the Bravery of the Garriſon, and of their Skill in defending Places. There was likewiſe taken by Compoſition, a ſmall Fort in the midſt of a Lake, which was under the Command of Don <hi>John Zanoguerra,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Valencia,</hi> and a Soldier of great Renown. Don <hi>Pedro Puerto Carrero,</hi> General of the <hi>Goletta</hi> was taken Priſoner, and was ſo afflicted at the loſs of the Place, that he dy'd of Grief by the Way, before he got to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> whither they were carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:54446:268"/>
him. They took alſo Priſoner the Commander of the Fort, whoſe Name was <hi>Gabriel Cerbellon,</hi> a <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> and a great Ingineer, as well as a valiant Soldier. Several Perſons of Quality were killed in thoſe two Fortreſſes, and amongſt the reſt was <hi>Pagan Doria,</hi> the Brother of the Famous <hi>John An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drea Doria,</hi> a Generous and Noble-hearted Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as well appear'd by his Liberality to that Brother; and that which made his Death more worthy of Compaſſion, was, that he receiv'd it from ſome <hi>Arabs,</hi> to whom he had committed his Safety after the loſs of the Fort, they having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to carry him diſguis'd in a <hi>Moor</hi>'s Habit to <hi>Tabarea,</hi> which is a ſmall Fort held on that Coaſt by the <hi>Genoeſes,</hi> for the diving for Coral; but they cut off his Head; and brought it to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> General, who made good to them our <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, That the Treaſon pleaſes, but the Traitors are odious; for he order'd them to be hang'd up immediately, for not having brought him alive. Amongſt the Chriſtians which were taken in the Fort, there was one Don <hi>Pedro de Aguilar,</hi> of ſome place in <hi>Andaluſia,</hi> and who was an Enſign in the Place; a very brave, and a very ingenious Man, and one who had a rare Talent in Poetry. I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion him, becauſe it was his fortune to be a Slave in the ſame Galley with me, and chain'd to the ſame Bench. Before we left the Port he made two Sonnets by way of Epitaph for the <hi>Goletta</hi> and the Fort, which I muſt beg leave to repeat here, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving learn'd them by Heart, and I believe they will rather divert than tire the Company. When the Captive nam'd Don <hi>Pedro de Aguilar,</hi> Don <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> look'd upon his Comrades, and they all ſmil'd; and when he talk'd of the Sonnets, one of them ſaid, before you go on to repeat the Sonnets, I deſire, Sir, you would tell me what became of
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:54446:269"/>
that Don <hi>Pedro d' Aguilar</hi> whom you have mention'd. All that I know of him, anſwer'd the Slave, is, that after having been two years in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> he made his eſcape, diſguis'd like an <hi>Arnaut,</hi> and in company of a <hi>Greek</hi> Spy; but I cannot tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he obtain'd his Liberty or no, though I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he did, becauſe about a year after, I ſaw the ſame <hi>Greek</hi> in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but had not an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to ask him about the Succeſs of his Journey. Then I can tell you, reply'd the Gentleman, That the Don <hi>Pedro</hi> you ſpeak of is my Brother, and is at preſent at home, Marry'd, Rich, and has three Children. God be thanked, ſaid the Slave, for the Favours he has beſtow'd on him, for in my mind there is no felicity equal to that of recovering ones loſt Liberty; and moreover, added the ſame Gentleman, I can ſay the Sonnets you mentioned, which my Brother made. Pray ſay them then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the Slave, for I queſtion not but you can repeat them better than I. With all my Heart, anſwer'd the Gentleman.

                              <pb n="490" facs="tcp:54446:270"/>The Sonnets were applauded, and the Captive was pleas'd to hear ſuch good News of his Friend and Companion: After that he purſu'd his Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in theſe Terms; The <hi>Turks</hi> order'd the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantling of the <hi>Goletta,</hi> the Fort being raz'd to their Hand by the Siege; and yet the Mines they made could not blow up the old Walls, which nevertheleſs were always thought the weakeſt Part of the Place; but the new Fortifications made by the Ingineer <hi>Fratin</hi> came eaſily down. In fine, the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Fleet return'd in Triumph to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where not long after my Maſter <hi>Vehali</hi> dy'd, whom the <hi>Turks</hi> us'd to call <hi>Vehali Furtare,</hi> which in <hi>Turkiſh</hi> ſignifies the Scabby Renegade, as indeed he was; and the <hi>Turks</hi> give Names among themſelves, either from ſome Virtue or ſome Defect that is in them; and this happens, becauſe there are but four Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies deſcended from the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Family, all the reſt, as I have ſaid, take their Names from ſome Defect of the Body, or ſome good Quality of the Mind. This ſcabby Slave was at the Oar in one of the Grand Signior's Gallies for fourteen Years, till he was four and thirty Years old; at which Time he turn'd Renegade, to be reveng'd of a <hi>Turk</hi> who gave him a Box on the Ear as he was chain'd to the Oar, forſaking his Religion for his Revenge; after which he ſhew'd ſo much Valour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, that he came to be King of <hi>Algiers,</hi> and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Fleet, which is the third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in the whole Empire. He was a <hi>Calabrian</hi> by Birth, and of a mild Diſpoſition towards his Slaves, as alſo of good Morals to the reſt of the World. He had above three thouſand Slaves of his own, all which after his Death were divided, as he had order'd by his Will, between the Grand Signior, his Sons, and his Renegades. I fell to the Share of a <hi>Venetian</hi> Renegade, who was a Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin-boy
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:54446:270"/>
in a <hi>Venetian</hi> Ship which was taken by <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hali,</hi> who lov'd him ſo that he was one of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite Boys; and he came at laſt to prove one of the cruell'ſt Renegades that ever was known. His Name was <hi>Azanaga,</hi> and he obtain'd ſuch Riches as to riſe by them to be King of <hi>Algiers;</hi> and with him I left <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> with ſome Satisfaction to think at leaſt that I was in a Place ſo near <hi>Spain,</hi> not becauſe I could give Advice to any Friend of my Misfortunes, but becauſe I hop'd to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſhould ſucceed better in <hi>Algiers</hi> than I had done in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where I had try'd a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Ways of running away, but could never exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute any of them, which I hop'd I ſhould compaſs better in <hi>Algiers,</hi> for Hopes never forſook me upon all the Diſappointments I met with in the Deſign of recovering my Liberty. By this Means I kept my ſelf alive, ſhut up in a Priſon or Houſe, which the <hi>Turks</hi> call a <hi>Bagnio,</hi> where they keep their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Slaves, as well thoſe of the King, as thoſe who belong to private Perſons, and alſo thoſe who are called <hi>El Almacen,</hi> that is, who belong to the Publick, and are employ'd by the City in Works that belong to it. Theſe Latter do very difficultly obtain their Liberty; for having no particular Maſter, but belonging to the Publick, they can find no Body to treat with about their Ranſom, though they have Money to pay it. The King's Slaves, which are ranſomable, are not oblig'd to go out to Works as the others do, except their Ranſom ſtays too long before it comes; for then to haſten it, they make them work, and fetch Wood with the reſt, which is no ſmall Labour. I was one of thoſe who were to be ranſom'd, for when they knew I had been a Captain, though I told them the Impoſſibility I was in of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd becauſe of my Poverty, yet they put me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:54446:271"/>
the Gentlemen that were to be ranſom'd, and to that End they put me on a ſlight Chain, rather as a Mark of Diſtinction than to reſtrain me by it; and ſo I paſs'd my Life in that <hi>Bagnio,</hi> with ſeveral other Gentlemen of Quality, who expected their Ranſom; and tho' Hunger and Nakedneſs might, as it did often, trouble us, yet nothing gave us ſuch Affliction, as to hear and ſee the exceſſive Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties with which our Maſter us'd the other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Slaves; he would hang one one Day, then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pale another, cut off the Ears of another, and this upon ſuch ſlight Occaſions, that often the <hi>Turks</hi> would own that he did it only for the Pleaſure of doing it, and becauſe he was naturally an Enemy to Mankind. Only one <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Soldier knew how to deal with him, his Name was <hi>Saavedra;</hi> and becauſe he did ſuch things as will not eaſily be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by the <hi>Turks,</hi> and all to gain his Liberty, his Maſter never gave him a Blow, nor us'd him ill either in Word or Deed; and yet we were always afraid that the leaſt of his Pranks would make him be impal'd, nay, he himſelf ſometimes was afraid of it too; and if it were not for Fear of taking up too much of our Time, I could tell ſuch Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of him as would divert the Company much better than the Relation of my Adventures, and cauſe more Wonder in them. But to go on; I ſay that the Windows of a very rich <hi>Moor</hi>'s Houſe look'd upon the Court of our Priſon; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, according to the Cuſtom of the Country, were rather Peeping-holes than Windows, and yet they had alſo Lettices or Jealouſies on the Inſide. It happen'd one Day, that being upon a kind of Terrace of our Priſon, with only three of my Comrades, diverting our ſelves as well as we could, by trying who could leap fartheſt in his Chains, all the other Chriſtians being gone out to work;
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:54446:271"/>
I chanc'd to look up to thoſe Windows, and ſaw that out of one of them there appear'd a long Cane, and to it was a Bit of Linnen ty'd, and the Cane was mov'd up and down, as if it had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that ſome of us ſhould lay hold of it. We all took Notice of it, and one of us went and ſtood juſt under it to ſee if they would let it fall; but juſt as he came to it the Cane was drawn up, and ſhak'd too and fro Sideways, as if they had made the ſame Sign as People do with their Head when they deny. He retir'd upon that, and the ſame Motion was made with it as before. Another of my Comrades advanc'd, and had the ſame Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs as the former; the third Man was us'd juſt as the reſt; which I ſeeing, reſolv'd to try the Adventure, and as I came under the Cane it fell at my Feet: Immediately I unty'd the Linnen, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in which was a Knot, which being open'd, ſhew'd us about ten <hi>Zianins,</hi> which is a ſort of Gold of baſe Allay, us'd by the <hi>Moors,</hi> each of which is worth about two Crowns of our Money. 'Tis not to be much queſtion'd, whether the Diſcovery were not as pleaſant as ſurprizing; we were in Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, and I more particularly, not being able to gueſs from what Part theſe Favours proceeded; for 'twas apparent that I was more meant than any of my Comrades, ſince the Cane was let go to me alone when it was refus'd to them. I took my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, broke the Cane, and going upon the Terrace ſaw that a very fine white Hand did open and ſhut the Window with Haſte; by this we imagin'd that ſome Woman that liv'd in that Houſe had done us the Charity, and to return our Thanks, we bow'd our ſelves after the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Faſhion with our Arms acroſs our Breaſts. A little after there appear'd out of the ſame Window a little Croſs made of Cane, which immediately was pull'd in
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:54446:272"/>
again. This confirm'd us in our Opinion, that ſome Chriſtian Woman was a Slave in that Houſe, and that it was ſhe that took Pity of us; but the Whiteneſs of the Hand, and the Richneſs of the Bracelets upon the Arm, which we had a Glimpſe of, ſeem'd to deſtroy that Thought again; and then we believ'd it was ſome Chriſtian Woman turn'd <hi>Mahometan,</hi> whom their Maſters very often marry, and take it for a great good Fortune, for they are more valu'd by them than the Women of the Country. But in all this Gueſſing we were far enough from finding out the Truth of the Caſe; however we reſolv'd to be very diligent in obſerving the Window, which was our North-Star. There paſs'd above fifteen Days before we ſaw either the Hand, or Cane, or any other Sign what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; though in all that Time we endeavour'd to find out who liv'd in that Houſe, and if there were in it any Chriſtian Woman who was a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negade; yet all we could diſcover amounted to only this, that the Houſe belong'd to one of the chief <hi>Moors,</hi> a very rich Man call'd <hi>Agimorato,</hi> who had been Alcayde of the <hi>Pata,</hi> which is an Office much valu'd among them. But when we leaſt hop'd that our Golden Shower ſhould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, out of that Window we ſaw on a ſudden the Cane appear again, with another Piece of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, and a bigger Knot; and this was juſt at a Time when the <hi>Bagnio</hi> was without any other of the Slaves in it. We all try'd our Fortunes as the firſt Time, and it ſucceeded accordingly, for the Cane was let go to none but me. I unty'd the Knot, and found in it forty Crowns in <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gold, with a Paper written in <hi>Arabick,</hi> and at the Top of the Paper was a great Croſs. I kiſs'd the Croſs, took the Crowns, and returning to the Terrace, we all made our <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Reverences; the Hand
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:54446:272"/>
appear'd again, and I having made Signs that I would read the Paper, the Window was ſhut. We remain'd all overjoy'd and aſtoniſh'd at what had happen'd; and were extreme deſirous to know the Contents of the Paper; but none of us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <hi>Arabick,</hi> and it was yet more difficult to find out a proper Interpreter. At laſt I reſolv'd to truſt a Renegade of <hi>Murcia,</hi> who had ſhew'd me great Proofs of his Kindneſs. We gave one another mutual Aſſurances, and on his Side he was oblig'd to keep ſecret all that I ſhould reveal to him. The Renegades, who have ſome Thoughts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning one Day to their own Country, uſe to get Certificates from the Perſons of Quality who are Slaves in <hi>Barbary;</hi> in which they make a ſort of an Affidavit, that ſuch an one, a Renegade, is an honeſt Man, and has always been kind to the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, and has a mind to make his Eſcape on the firſt Occaſion. Some there are who procure theſe Certificates with an honeſt Deſign; but others get them on purpoſe to make uſe of them when they go a Pirating on the Chriſtian Shores; for then if they are Shipwreck'd or taken, they ſhew theſe Certificates, and ſay, that thereby may be ſeen the Intention with which they came in the <hi>Turks</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; to wit, to get an Opportunity of returning to Chriſtendom: By this means they eſcape the firſt Fury of the Chriſtians, and are Reconcil'd to the Church without having been hurt; afterwards they take their time, and return to <hi>Barbary,</hi> to be what they were before.</p>
                           <p>One of theſe Renegades was my Friend, and he had Certificates from us all, by which we gave him much Commmendation: but if the <hi>Moors</hi> had catch'd him with thoſe Papers about him, they would have burnt him alive. I knew that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he underſtood the <hi>Arabic</hi> Tongue, but alſo that
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:54446:273"/>
he could both ſpeak and write it currently. But yet before I reſolv'd to truſt him intirely, I bid him read me that Paper which I had found by chance; he opened it, and was a good while look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it, and conſtruing it to himſelf. I ask'd him if he underſtood it; He ſaid yes, very well; and that if I would give him Pen and Ink and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, he would tranſlate it Word for Word. We furniſh'd him with what he deſir'd, and he went to work; having finiſh'd his Tranſlation, he ſaid, all that I have here put into <hi>Spaniſh</hi> is Word for Word what is in the <hi>Arabick;</hi> only obſerve that where-ever the Paper ſays <hi>Lela Marien,</hi> it means our Lady the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> The Contents were thus.</p>
                           <p>
                              <q>When I was a Child, my Father had a Slave, who taught me in my Tongue the Chriſtian Worſhip, and told me a great many things of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la Marien:</hi> The Chriſtian Slave dy'd, and I am ſure ſhe went not to the Fire, but is with <hi>Alla,</hi> for I have ſeen her twice; and ſhe bid me go to the Land of the Chriſtians to ſee <hi>Lela Marien,</hi> who had a great Kindneſs for me. I do not know what is the matter; but though I have ſeen ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſtians out of this Window, none has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to me ſo much a Gentleman as thy ſelf. I am very handſome and young, and can carry with me a great deal of Money, and other Riches; conſider whether thou can'ſt bring it to paſs that we may eſcape together, and thou ſhalt be my Husband in thy own Country, if thou art wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; but if thou art not, 'tis all one, <hi>Lela Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rien</hi> will provide me a Husband. I have writ this, have a Care whom thou giveſt it to read to, do not truſt any <hi>Moor,</hi> becauſe they are all Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; and in this I am much perplex'd, and could wiſh there were not a neceſſity of truſting any,
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:54446:273"/>
one; becauſe if my Father ſhould come to know it, he would certainly throw me into a Well, and cover me over with Stones. I will tie a Thread to the Cane, and with that thou may'ſt faſten thy Anſwer; and if thou canſt not find any one to write in <hi>Arabick,</hi> make me underſtand thy meaning by Signs, for <hi>Lela Marien</hi> will help me to gueſs it. She and <hi>Alla</hi> keep thee, as well as this Croſs, which I often kiſs, as the Chriſtian Slave bid me.</q>

                           <p>You may imagine, Gentlemen, that we were in admiration at the Contents of this Paper, and withal o'erjoy'd at them, which we expreſs'd ſo openly, that the Renegade came to underſtand that the Paper was not found by chance, but that it was really writ to ſome one among us, and accordingly he told us his Suſpicion, but deſir'd us to truſt him entirely, and that he wou'd venture his Life with us to procure us our Liberty. Having ſaid this, he pull'd a Crucifix of Metal out of his Boſom, and with many Tears, ſwore by the God which it repreſented, and in whom he, though a wicked Sinner, did firmly believe, to be true and faithful to us with all Secreſy in what we ſhou'd impart to him; for he gueſs'd that by the means of the Woman who had writ that Letter, we might all of us recover our loſt Liberty, and he in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular might obtain what he had ſo long wiſh'd for, to be receiv'd again into the Boſom of his Mother the Church. The Renegade pronounc'd all this with ſo many Tears, and ſuch Signs of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that we were all of Opinion to truſt him, and tell him the whole Truth of the Buſineſs. We ſhew'd him the little Window out of which the Cane us'd to appear, and he from thence took good notice of the Houſe, in order to inform himſelf who liv'd in it. We next agreed that it wou'd be neceſſary to anſwer the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Ladies Note, ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:54446:274"/>
the Renegade writ down what I dictated to him; which was exactly as I ſhall relate, for I have not forgot the leaſt material Circumſtance of this Adventure, nor can forget them in all my Life. The Words then were theſe.</p>
                           <p>
                              <q>The true <hi>Alla</hi> keep thee, my dear Lady, and that bleſſed Virgin, which is the true Mother of God, and has inſpir'd thee with the deſign of going to the Land of the Chriſtians. Do thou ask her that ſhe wou'd be pleas'd to make thee underſtand how thou ſhalt execute what ſhe has commanded thee, for ſhe is ſo good that ſhe will do it. On my part, and on that of the Chriſtians who are with me, I offer to do for thee all we are able, even to the hazard of our Lives. Fail not to write to me, and give me notice of thy reſolution, for I will aways an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thee: The <hi>Great Alla</hi> having given us a Chriſtian Slave, who can read and write thy Language, as thou may'ſt perceive by this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſo that thou may'ſt without fear give us notice of all thy Intentions. As for what thou ſay'ſt, that as ſoon as thou ſhalt arrive in the Land of the Chriſtians, thou deſign'ſt to be my Wife; I promiſe thee on the word of a good Chriſtian to take thee for my Wife, and thou may'ſt know that Chriſtians do perform their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes better than the <hi>Moors. Alla,</hi> and his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Mary</hi> be thy Guard, my dear Lady.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>Having writ and clos'd this Note, I expected two Days till the <hi>Bagnio</hi> was empty, and then I went upon the Terrace, the ordinary place of our Converſation, to ſee if the Cane was abroad, and it was not long before it was ſtirring. As ſoon as it appear'd I ſhew'd my Note, that the Thread might be put to the Cane, but I found that was done to my Hand; and the Cane being let down
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:54446:274"/>
I faſtn'd the Note to it. Not long after the Knot was let fall, and I having taken it up, found in it ſeveral Pieces of Gold and Silver, above fifty Crowns, which gave us infinite content, and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd our Hopes of obtaining at laſt our Liberty. That Evening our Renegade came to us, and told us he had found out that the Maſter of that Houſe was the ſame <hi>Moor</hi> we had been told of, call'd <hi>Agimorato,</hi> extremely rich, and who had one only Daughter to inherit all his Eſtate. That it was the Report of all the City, that ſhe was the handſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Maid in all <hi>Barbary,</hi> having been demanded in Marriage by ſeveral Baſſas and Viceroys, but that ſhe had always refus'd to Marry; He alſo told us, that he had learnt ſhe had had a Chriſtian Slave who was dead, all which agreed with the Contents of the Letter. We immediately held a Council with the Renegade, about the manner we might uſe to carry off the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Lady, and go all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Chriſtendom; but all we agreed was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the Anſwer of <hi>Zoraida,</hi> for that was the Name of the Lady, who now deſires to be call'd <hi>Mary;</hi> as well knowing ſhe cou'd beſt adviſe the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming all the Difficulties that were in our Way; and after this Reſolution the Renegade aſſur'd us again, that he wou'd loſe his Life, or deliver us out of Captivity.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Bagnio</hi> was Four Days together full of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and all that Time the Cane was inviſible; but as ſoon as it return'd to its Solitude, the Cane ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd, with a Knot much bigger than ordinary: Having unty'd it, I found in it a Letter, and a Hundred Crowns in Gold. The Renegade hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd that Day to be with us, and we gave him the Letter to read, which he ſaid contain'd theſe Words.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="500" facs="tcp:54446:275"/>
                              <q>I cannot tell, Sir, how to contrive that we may go together for <hi>Spain;</hi> neither has <hi>Lela Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rien</hi> told it me, tho' I have earneſtly ask'd it of her: all I can do, is to furniſh you out of this Window with a great deal of Riches, buy your Ranſom and your Friends with that; and let one of you go to <hi>Spain,</hi> and buy a Bark there, and come and fetch the reſt: As for me, you ſhall find me in my Father's Garden out of Town, by the Sea-ſide, not far from <hi>Babaſſo</hi> Gate; where I am to paſs all the Summer with my Father and my Maids, from which you may take me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Fear in the Night time, and carry me to your Bark; but remember thou art to be my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; and if thou faileſt in that, I will deſire <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la Marien</hi> to Chaſtiſe thee. If thou canſt not truſt one of thy Friends to go for the Bark, pay thy own Ranſom, and go thy ſelf; for I truſt thou wilt return ſooner than another, ſince thou art a Gentleman and a Chriſtian. Find out my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Garden, and I will take care to watch when the <hi>Bagnio</hi> is empty, and let thee have more Money. <hi>Alla</hi> keep my dear Lord.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>Theſe were the Contents of the ſecond Letter we receiv'd. Upon the reading of it, every one of us offer'd to be the Man that ſhould go and buy the Barque, promiſing to return with all Punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality; but the Renegade oppos'd that Propoſition, and ſaid, he would never conſent any one of us ſhould obtain his Liberty before the reſt, becauſe Experience had taught him, that People once Free do not perform what they promiſe when Captives; and that often ſome Slaves of Quality had us'd that Remedy, to ſend one either to <hi>Valencia</hi> or <hi>Majorca,</hi> with Money to buy a Barque, and come back and fetch the reſt; but that they never return'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Joy of having obtain'd their Liberty, and
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:54446:275"/>
the Fear of loſing it again, made them forget whatever they had promis'd, and all the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the World. To confirm which, he related to us a ſtrange Story, which had happen'd in thoſe Parts, as there often does among the Slaves. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, he ſaid that all that could be done, was for him to buy a Barque with the Money which ſhould redeem one of us; that he could buy one in <hi>Algiers,</hi> and pretend to turn Merchant, and deal between <hi>Algiers</hi> and <hi>Tetuan;</hi> by which means, he being Maſter of the Veſſel, might eaſily find out ſome ways of getting us out of the <hi>Bagnio,</hi> and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king us on Board; and the rather, if the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Lady did what ſhe promis'd, and gave us Money to pay our Ranſoms; for being free, we might Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark even at Noon-day. That the only Difficulty would be, that the <hi>Moors</hi> do not permit Renegades to keep any Barques, but great ones fit to Cruize upon Chriſtians; for they believe that a Renegade, particularly a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> ſeldom buys a Barque, but with a Deſign of returning to his own Country. That however, he knew how to obviate that Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, by taking a <hi>Tagarin Moor</hi> for his Partner in the Gains of the Barque and Trade, by which means he ſhould ſtill be Maſter of her, and then all the reſt would be eaſy. We durſt not oppoſe this Opinion, tho' we had more Inclination every one of us to go to <hi>Spain</hi> for a Barque, as the Lady had advis'd; but we were afraid that if we contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him we might be at his Mercy, and he might betray us, and bring our Lives in Danger; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, if the Buſineſs of <hi>Zoraida</hi> ſhould be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, for whoſe Liberty and Life we would have given all ours; ſo we determin'd to put our ſelves under the Protection of God and the Renegade. At the ſame time we anſwer'd <hi>Zoraida,</hi> telling her, that we would do all ſhe advis'd, which was very
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:54446:276"/>
well, and juſt as if <hi>Lela Marien</hi> her ſelf had inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her; and that it now depended on her alone to give us the means of bringing this Deſign to paſs. I promis'd her once more to be her Husband. After this in two Days that the <hi>Bagnio</hi> happen'd to be empty, ſhe gave us by the means of the Cane two thouſand Crowns of Gold; and withal a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in which ſhe let us know, that the next <hi>Jum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>,</hi> which is their <hi>Friday,</hi> ſhe was to go to her Father's Garden, and that before ſhe went ſhe would give us more Money; and if we had not enough, ſhe would upon our letting her know it, give us what we ſhould think ſufficient; for her Father was ſo rich, he would hardly miſs it; and ſo much the leſs, becauſe he entruſted her with the Keys of all his Treaſure. We preſently gave the Renegade Fifteen hundred Crowns to buy the Barque, and I paid my own Ranſom with Eight hundred Crowns, which I put into the Hands of a Merchant of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencia,</hi> then in <hi>Algiers,</hi> who made the Bargain with the King, and had me to his Houſe upon Parole, to pay the Money upon the Arrival of the firſt Barque from <hi>Valencia;</hi> for if he had paid down the Money immediately, the King might have ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Money had been ready, and lain ſome time in <hi>Algiers,</hi> and that the Merchant for his own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit had conceal'd it; and in ſhort, I durſt not truſt my Maſter with ready Money, knowing his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſtful and malicious Nature. The <hi>Thurſday</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding that <hi>Friday</hi> that <hi>Zoraida</hi> was to go to the Garden, ſhe let us have a thouſand Crowns more; deſiring me at the ſame Time, that if I paid my Ranſom, I would find out her Father's Garden, and contrive ſome way of ſeeing her there. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd in few Words, that I would do as ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd, and ſhe ſhould only take Care to recommend us to <hi>Lela Marien,</hi> by thoſe Prayers which the
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:54446:276"/>
Chriſtian Slave had taught her. Having done this, order was taken to have the Ranſom of my three Friends paid alſo; leſt they ſeeing me at Liberty, and themſelves not ſo, though there was Money to ſet them free, ſhould be troubl'd in Mind, and give way to the Temptation of the Devil, in doing ſomething that might redound to the Prejudice of <hi>Zoraida;</hi> for though the Conſideration of their Quality ought to have given me Security of their Honour, yet I did not think it proper to run the leaſt hazard in the matter: So they were redeem'd in the ſame manner, and by the ſame Merchant that I was, who had the Money before-hand; but we never diſcover'd to him the Remainder of our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue, as not being willing to run the Danger there was in doing it.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> The Adventures of the Captive continued.</head>
                           <p>OUR Renegade had in a Fortnight's Time bought a very good Barque, capable of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carrying above thirty People; and to give no Suſpicion of any other Deſign, he undertook a Voyage to a Place upon the Coaſt call'd <hi>Sargel,</hi> about thirty Leagues to the Eaſtward of <hi>Algiers</hi> towards <hi>Oran,</hi> where there is a great Trade for dry'd Figs. He made this Voyage two or three Times, in Company with the <hi>Tagarin Moor</hi> his Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Thoſe <hi>Moors</hi> are call'd in <hi>Barbary, Tagarins,</hi> who were driven out of <hi>Aragon;</hi> as they call thoſe of <hi>Granada, Mudajares;</hi> and the ſame in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:54446:277"/>
of <hi>Fez</hi> are call'd <hi>Elches,</hi> and are the beſt Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that Prince has.</p>
                           <p>Every Time he paſs'd with his Barque along the Coaſt, he us'd to caſt Anchor in a little Bay that was not above two Bow-ſhot from the Garden where <hi>Zoraida</hi> expected us; and there he us'd to exerciſe the <hi>Moors</hi> that row'd, either in making the <hi>Sala,</hi> which is a Ceremony among them, or in ſome other Employment; by which he practis'd in Jeſt what he was reſolv'd to execute in Earneſt. So ſometimes he would go to the Garden of <hi>Zoraida</hi> and beg ſome Fruit, and her Father would give him ſome though he did not know him. He had a Mind to find an Occaſion to ſpeak to <hi>Zoraida,</hi> and tell her, as he ſince own'd to me, that he was the Man who by my Order was to carry her to the Land of the Chriſtians, and that ſhe might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon it; but he could never get an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of doing it, becauſe the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> and <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Women never ſuffer themſelves to be ſeen by any of their own Nation, but by their Husband, or by his or their Father's Command; but as for the Chriſtian Slaves, they let them ſee them, and that more familiarly than perhaps could be wiſh'd. I ſhould have been very ſorry that the Renegade had ſeen or ſpoke to <hi>Zoraida,</hi> for it muſt needs have troubl'd her infinitely to ſee that her Buſineſs was truſted to a Renegade; and God Almighty, who govern'd our Deſign, order'd it ſo, that the Rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade was diſappointed. He in the mean Time ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how ſecurely, and without Suſpicion, he went and came along the Coaſt, ſtaying where and when he pleas'd by the Way, and that his Partner the <hi>Tagarin Moor</hi> was of his Mind in all things; that I was at Liberty, and that there wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſome Chriſtians to help us to row; he bid me conſider whom I intended to carry with me
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:54446:277"/>
beſides thoſe who were ranſom'd, and that I ſhould make ſure of them for the firſt <hi>Friday,</hi> becauſe he had pitch'd on that Day for our Departure. Upon Notice of this Reſolution, I ſpoke to twelve luſty <hi>Spaniards,</hi> good Rowers, and thoſe who might eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt get out of the City. It was a great Fortune that we got ſo many in ſuch a Conjuncture, becauſe there were above twenty Sail of Rovers gone out, who had taken aboard moſt of the Slaves fit for the Oar; and we had not had theſe but that their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter happen'd to ſtay at home that Summer, to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh a Galley he was building to cruize with, and was then upon the Stocks. I ſaid no more to them, than only they ſhould ſteal out of the Town in the Evening upon the next <hi>Friday,</hi> and ſtay for me upon the Way that led to <hi>Agimorato</hi>'s Garden. I ſpoke to every one by himſelf, and gave each of them Order to ſay no more to any other Chriſtian they ſhould ſee, than that they ſaid for me there. Having done this, I had another thing of the greateſt Importance to bring to paſs, which was to give <hi>Zoraida</hi> Notice of our Deſign, and how far we had carry'd it; that ſhe might be ready at a ſhort Warning, and not be ſurpriz'd if we came on the Houſe on a Sudden, and even before ſhe could think that the Chriſtian Barque could be come. This made me reſolve to go to the Garden, to try if it were poſſible to ſpeak to her: So one Day, upon Pretence of gathering a few Herbs, I entred the Garden, and the firſt Perſon I met was her Father, who ſpoke to me in the Language us'd all over the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Dominions, which is a Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all the Chriſtian and <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Languages, by which we underſtand one another from <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> to <hi>Algier,</hi> and ask'd me what I look'd for in his Garden, and who I belong'd to? I told him I was a Slave of <hi>Arnaute Mami,</hi> (this Man I knew was
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:54446:278"/>
his intimate Friend) and that I wanted a few Herbs to make up a Sallad. He then ask'd me if I were a Man to be redeem'd or no, and how much my Maſter ask'd for me? During theſe Queſtions the beautiful <hi>Zoraida</hi> came out of a Garden-houſe hard by, having deſcry'd me a good while before; and as the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Women make no Difficulty of ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves to the Chriſtian Slaves, ſhe drew near without Scruple to the Place where her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and I were talking; neither did her Father ſhew any Diſlike of her coming, but call'd to her to come nearer. It would be hard for me to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs here the wonderful Surprize and Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the Beauty, the rich Dreſs, and the charming Air of my beloved <hi>Zoraida</hi> put me in: She was all bedeck'd with Pearls, which hung thick upon her Head and about her Neck and Arms. Her Feet and Legs were naked after the Cuſtom of that Country, and ſhe had upon them a kind of Bracelet of Gold, and ſet with ſuch rich Diamonds, that her Father valu'd them, as ſhe ſince told me, at ten thouſand Piſtoles a Pair, and thoſe upon her Wriſts were of the ſame Value. The Pearls were of the beſt Sort, for the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Women delight much in them, and have more Pearls of all Sorts than any Nation. Her Father was reputed to have the fineſt in <hi>Algiers,</hi> and to be worth beſides above two hundred thouſand <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Crowns; of all which the Lady you here ſee was then Miſtreſs, but now is only ſo of me. What ſhe yet retains of Beauty in all her Sufferings, may well help you to gueſs at her wonderful Appearance in the Midſt of all her Proſperity. The Handſomneſs of moſt Ladies has Days and Times, and is more or leſs according to Accidents or Paſſions, which naturally raiſe or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the Luſtre of it, and ſometimes quite extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it. All that I can ſay is, that at that Time
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:54446:278"/>
ſhe appear'd to me the moſt raviſhing Object I had ever ſeen; to which, adding the Obligations I had to her, ſhe paſs'd with me for a Goddeſs from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, deſcended upon Earth for my Relief and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. As ſhe drew near, her Father told her in his Country Language that I was a Slave of his Friend <hi>Arnaute Mami,</hi> and came to pick a Sallad in his Garden. She preſently took the Hint, and ask'd me in <hi>Lingua Franca</hi> whether I was a Gentleman, and if I was, why I did not ranſom my ſelf. I told her I was already ranſom'd, and that by the Price ſhe might gueſs the Value my Maſter ſet upon me, ſince he had bought me for 1500 Pieces of Eight: To which ſhe reply'd, if thou had'ſt been my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Slave I would not have let him part with thee for twice as much; for, ſaid ſhe, you Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans never ſpeak Truth in any thing you ſay, and make your ſelves poor to deceive the <hi>Moors.</hi> That may be, Madam, ſaid I, but in truth I have dealt by my Maſter, and do intend to deal by all thoſe I ſhall have to deal with, ſincerely and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. And when doſt thou go home, ſaid ſhe? To morrow, Madam, ſaid I, for here is a <hi>French</hi> Barque that Sails to Morrow, and I intend not to loſe that Opportunity. Is it not better, reply'd <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raida,</hi> to ſtay till there come ſome <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Barque, and go with them, and not with the <hi>French,</hi> who, I am told, are no Friends of yours? No, ſaid I, yet if the report of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Barque's coming ſhould prove true, I would perhaps ſtay for it, though 'tis more certain to take the Opportunity of the <hi>French;</hi> and beſides, the deſire I have of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at home, and with thoſe Perſons I love, will hardly let me wait for a better conveniency. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, ſaid <hi>Zoraida,</hi> thou art Marry'd in <hi>Spain,</hi> and impatient to be with thy Wife. I am not, ſaid I, Marry'd, but I have given my Word to a Lady
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:54446:279"/>
to be ſo as ſoon as I can reach my own Country. And is the Lady handſome that has your Promiſes ſaid <hi>Zoraida?</hi> She is ſo handſome, ſaid I, that to deſcribe her rightly, and tell truth, I can only ſay ſhe is like you. At this her Father laugh'd hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, and ſaid, thou art much to be pitied if ſhe be like my Daughter, who is the greateſt Beauty of all this Kingdom: Look upon her well, and thou wilt ſay I ſpeak Truth. <hi>Zoraida</hi>'s Father was our Interpreter for the moſt of what we talk'd, for though ſhe underſtood the <hi>Lingua Franca,</hi> yet ſhe was not us'd to ſpeak it, and ſo explain'd her ſelf more by Signs than Words. While we were in this Converſation there came a <hi>Moor</hi> running ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily, and cry'd aloud that four <hi>Turks</hi> had leap'd over the Fence of the Garden, and were gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fruit though it was not ripe. The old Man ſtarted at that, and ſo did <hi>Zoraida,</hi> for the <hi>Moors</hi> do naturally ſtand in great Awe of the <hi>Turks,</hi> particularly of the Soldiers, who are ſo inſolent on their Side, that they treat the <hi>Moors</hi> as if they were their Slaves. This made the Father bid his Daughter go home, and ſhut her ſelf up cloſe, whilſt, ſaid he, I go and talk with thoſe Dogs; and for thee, Chriſtian, gather the Herbs thou want'ſt, and go thy ways in Peace, and God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct thee ſafe to thy own Country. I bow'd to him, and he left me with <hi>Zoraida</hi> to go and find out the <hi>Turks:</hi> She made alſo as if ſhe were going away, as her Father had bid her, but ſhe was no ſooner hid from his Sight by the Trees of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, but ſhe turn'd towards me with her Eyes full of Tears, and ſaid in her Language, <hi>Amexi Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ano Amexi,</hi> which is, Thou are going away, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, thou are going: To which I anſwer'd, Yes, Madam, I am, but by no Means without you; you may expect me the firſt <hi>Friday,</hi> and be not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd,
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:54446:279"/>
for we will moſt certainly go to the Land of the Chriſtians. I ſaid this ſo paſſionately, that ſhe underſtood me; and throwing one of her Arms about my Neck, ſhe began to walk ſoftly and with trembling towards the Houſe It pleas'd Fortune, that as we were in this Poſture walking together, (which might have prov'd very unlucky to us) we met <hi>Agimorato</hi> coming back from the <hi>Turks,</hi> and we perceiv'd he had ſeen us as we were; but <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raida,</hi> very readily and diſcreetly, was ſo far from taking away her Arm from about my Neck, that drawing ſtill nearer to me, ſhe lean'd her Head up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Breaſt, and letting her Knees give Way, was in the Poſture of one that ſwoons; I at the ſame Time made as if I had much ado to bear her up againſt my Will. Her Father came haſtily to me, and ſeeing his Daughter in this Condition, ask'd her what was the Matter? But ſhe not anſwering readily, he preſently ſaid, Without Doubt theſe <hi>Turks</hi> have frighted her, and ſhe faints away; at which he took her in his Arms. She as it were coming to her ſelf, fetch'd a deep Sigh, and with her Eyes not yet dry'd from Tears, ſhe ſaid, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mexi Chriſtiano Amexi,</hi> Be gone, Chriſtian, be gone; to which her Father reply'd, 'Tis no Matter, Child, whether he go or no, he has done thee no Hurt, and the <hi>Turks</hi> are already gone away. 'Tis they who frighted her, Sir, ſaid I; but ſince ſhe deſires I ſhou'd be gone, I'll come another Time for my Sallad, by your Leave; for my Maſter ſays the Herbs of your Garden are the beſt of any he can have. Thou may'ſt have what, and when thou wilt, ſaid the Father; for my Daughter does not think the Chriſtians troubleſome, ſhe only wiſh'd the <hi>Turks</hi> away, and by Miſtake bid thee be gone too, or put thee in Mind to gather thy Herbs. With this I immediately took Leave of
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:54446:280"/>
'em both, and <hi>Zoraida</hi> ſhewing great Trouble in her Looks went with her Father. I in the mean Time, upon Pretence of gathering my Herbs here and there, walk'd all over the Garden, obſerving exactly all the Places of coming in and going out, and every Corner fit for my Purpoſe, as well as what Strength there was in the Houſe, with all other Conveniences to facilitate our Buſineſs. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done this I went my ways, and gave an exact Account of all that had happen'd to the Renegade and the reſt of my Friends, longing earneſtly for the Time in which I might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe my ſelf my dear <hi>Zoraida</hi>'s Company without any Fear of Diſturbance. At laſt that happy Hour came, and we had all the good Succeſs we cou'd promiſe our ſelves of a Deſign ſo well laid; for the <hi>Friday</hi> after my Diſcourſe with <hi>Zoraida,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Evening we came to an Anchor with our Bark, almoſt over againſt the place where my lovely Miſtreſs liv'd; the Chriſtians who were to be employ'd at the Oar, were already at the Rendezvous, and hid up and down there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts. They were all in expectation of my coming, and very deſirous to ſeize the Bark which they ſaw before their Eyes, for they did not know our agreement with the Renegade, but thought they were by main force to gain their conveyance and their Liberty, by killing the <hi>Moors</hi> on board. As ſoon as I and my Friends appear'd, all the reſt came from their hiding places to us. By this time the City-Gates were ſhut, and no Soul ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in all the Country near us. When we were all together, it was a queſtion whether we ſhou'd firſt fetch <hi>Zoraida,</hi> or make our ſelves Maſters of thoſe few <hi>Moors</hi> in the Bark. As we were in this conſultation, the Renegade came to us, and asking what we meant to ſtand idle, told us his <hi>Moors</hi> were
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:54446:280"/>
all gone to reſt, and moſt of them aſleep. We told him our difficulty, and he immediately ſaid, that the moſt important thing was to ſecure the Bark, which might eaſily be done, and without danger, and then me might go for <hi>Zoraida.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>We were all of his mind, and ſo without more ado, he march'd in the Head of us to the Bark, and leaping into it, he firſt drew a Scimitar, and cry'd aloud in the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Language, let not a Man of you ſtir, except he means it ſhou'd coſt him his Life; and while he ſaid this, all the other Chriſtians were got on board; the <hi>Moors,</hi> who are naturally timorous, hearing the Maſter uſe this Language, were frighted, and without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance ſuffer'd themſelves to be Manacl'd, which was done with great expedition by the Chriſtians, who told them at the ſame time, that if they made the leaſt noiſe, they would immediately cut their Throats: This being done, and half of our number left to guard them; the remainder with the Renegade, went to the Garden of <hi>Agimorato;</hi> and our good Fortune was ſuch, that coming to force the Gate, we found it open with ſo much facility as if it had not been ſhut at all. So we march'd on with great ſilence to the Houſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being perceiv'd by any body. The lovely <hi>Zoraida,</hi> who was at the Window, ask'd ſoftly, upon hearing us tread, whether we were <hi>Nizarani,</hi> that is, Chriſtians? I anſwer'd, Yes; and deſir'd her to come down. As ſoon as ſhe knew my voice, ſhe ſtaid not a Minute; but, without ſaying a Word, came down, and open'd the door, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to us all like a Goddeſs, her Beauty and the richneſs of her Dreſs not being to be deſcrib'd. As ſoon as I ſaw her, I ſeiz'd her by one hand, which I kiſs'd, the Renegade did the ſame, and then my Friends; the reſt of the company fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd

the ſame Ceremony; ſo that we all paid her a kind of homage for our Liberty. The Renegade askt her in <hi>Moriſco</hi> whether her Father were in the Garden? She ſaid Yes, and that he was aſleep. Then, ſaid he, we muſt wake him, and take him with us, as alſo all that's valuable in the Houſe: No, no, ſaid <hi>Zoraida,</hi> my Father muſt not be touch'd, and in the Houſe there is nothing ſo rich as what I ſhall carry with me, which is enough to make you all rich and content. Having ſaid this, ſhe ſtept into the Houſe, bid us be quiet, and ſhe wou'd ſoon return. I askt the Renegade what had paſſed between them, and he told me what he had ſaid; to which I reply'd, that by no means any thing was to be done otherwiſe than <hi>Zoraida</hi> ſhou'd pleaſe. She was already coming back with a ſmall Trunk ſo full of Gold, that ſhe cou'd hardly carry it: When, to our great Miſ-fortunes, while this was doing her Father awak'd; and having heard ſome noiſe in the Garden, open'd a Window and look out: Having perceiv'd that there were Chriſtians in it, he began to cry out in <hi>Arabick,</hi> Thieves, Thieves, Chriſtians, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Theſe Cries of his put us all into a terrible diſorder and fear; but the Renegade ſeeing our danger, and how much it imported us to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh our Enterpize before we were perceiv'd, he ran up to the place where <hi>Agimorato</hi> was, and took with him ſome of our Company; for I durſt by no means leave <hi>Zoraida,</hi> who had ſwoon'd away in my Arms; thoſe who went up beſtirr'd themſelves ſo well, that they brought down <hi>Agimorato</hi> with his hands ty'd behind him, and his Mouth ſtopt with a Cloath, which hindred him from ſo much as ſpeaking a Word; and threatning him beſides, that if he made the leaſt attempt to ſpeak, it ſhould coſt him his Life. When his Daughter, who was
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:54446:282"/>
come to her ſelf, ſaw him, ſhe cover'd her Eyes to avoid the ſight, and her Father remain'd the more aſtoniſh'd, for he knew not how willingly ſhe had put her ſelf into our hands. Diligence on our ſide being the chief thing requir'd, we us'd it ſo as we got to our Barque, where our Men began to be in pain for us, as fearing we had met with ſome ill Accident: We got on board about two hours after 'twas dark, where the firſt thing we did was to unty the hands of <hi>Zoraida</hi>'s Father, and to unſtop his Mouth, but ſtill with the ſame threatnings of the Renegade, in caſe he made any noiſe. When he ſaw his Daughter there he began to ſigh moſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately, and more when he ſaw me embrace her with tenderneſs, and that ſhe without any reſiſtance or ſtrugling ſeem'd to endure it; he for all this was ſilent, for fear the threatnings of the Renegade ſhould be put in Execution. <hi>Zoraida</hi> ſeeing us aboard, and that we were ready to handle our Oars to be gone, ſhe bid the Renegade tell me, ſhe deſir'd I wou'd ſet her Father and the other <hi>Moors</hi> our Priſoners on ſhore; for elſe ſhe would throw her ſelf into the Sea, rather than ſee a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who had us'd her ſo tenderly, be carry'd away Captive for herſake before her Eyes. The Renegade told me what ſhe ſaid, to which I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed; but the Renegade was of another Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſaying, that if we ſet them on ſhore there, they would raiſe the Country, and give the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm to the City, by which ſome light Frigates might be diſpatch'd in queſt of us, and getting between us and the Sea, it would be impoſſible for us to make our Eſcape; and that all that could be done, was to ſet them at liberty in the firſt Chriſtian Land we could reach. This ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo reaſonable to us all, that <hi>Zoraida</hi> her ſelf being inform'd of the Motives we had not to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:54446:283"/>
her at preſent, agreed to it. Immediately with great ſilence and content we began to ply our Oars, recommending our ſelves to Providence with all our hearts, and endeavour'd to make for <hi>Majorca,</hi> which is the neareſt Chriſtian Land; but the North wind riſing a little, and the Sea with it, we could not hold that Courſe, but were forc'd to drive along-ſhore towards <hi>Oran,</hi> not without great fear of being diſcover'd from <hi>Sargel,</hi> upon the Coaſt, about thirty Leagues from <hi>Algier<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Though, to ſay Truth, we did not ſo much fear theſe laſt; for except it were a cruizing Galliot, we all of us wiſh'd to meet one well loaden with Merchandize, for then we might ſo get a better Veſſel to tranſport us in. <hi>Zoraida</hi> had her Head hid between my Hands, that ſhe might not ſee her Father, and I could hear her call upon <hi>Lela Marien</hi> to help us. By that time we had got about 30 Miles the Day broke, and we found our ſelves within a Mile of the Shore, which appear'd to us a Deſart Solitary Place, but yet we row'd hard to get off to Sea, for fear of being diſcover'd by ſome body. When we were got about two Leagues out to Sea, we propos'd to take turns in Rowing, that ſome might refreſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but the Men at the Oar ſaid it was not time yet to reſt, and that they could eat and row too if thoſe who did not row would aſſiſt them, and give them Meat and Drink; this we did, and a little while after the Wind riſing at large from Sea, we ſet Sail for <hi>Oran,</hi> not being able to hold any other Courſe. We made above eight Miles an Hour, being in no fear of any thing but meeting ſome Cruizers. We gave Victuals to our <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Priſoners, and the Renegade comforted
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:54446:283"/>
them, and told them they were not Slaves, but that they ſhould be ſet at liberty upon the firſt Opportunity. The ſame thing was ſaid to the Father of <hi>Zoraida;</hi> who anſwer'd, I might expect from your Courteſie other things perhaps, O Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but that you ſhould give me my Liberty I am not ſimple enough to believe; for you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver would have run the hazard of taking it from me, if you intend to reſtore it ſo eaſily; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſince you know who I am, and what you may get for my Ranſom, which if you will but name, I will from this moment offer you all that you can deſire for me, and for that unfortunate Daughter of mine, or for her alone, ſince ſhe is the better part of me. When he had ſaid this, he burſt out into Tears ſo violently, that <hi>Zoraida</hi> could not forbear looking up at him, and indeed he mov'd Compaſſion in us all, but in her particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly; inſomuch, as ſtarting from my Arms, ſhe flew to her Father's, and putting her head to his, they began again ſo paſſionate and tender a Scene, that moſt of us could not forbear accompanying their Grief with our Tears; but her Father ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſo richly Dreſs'd, and ſo many Jewels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her, ſaid to her in his Language, What is the meaning of this, Daughter; for laſt night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this terrible misfortune befell us, thou wert in thy ordinary Dreſs; and now, without ſcarce having had the time to put on ſuch things, I ſee thee adorn'd with all the fineries that I could give thee, if we were at Liberty and deſigned to be Merry? This gives me more Wonder and Trouble than even our ſad Misfortune; therefore anſwer me. The Renegade interpreted all that the <hi>Moor</hi> ſaid, and we ſaw that <hi>Zoraida</hi> anſwer'd not one Word; but on a Sudden, he ſpying the little Casket in which ſhe was us'd to put her Jewels,
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:54446:284"/>
which he thought had been left in <hi>Algiers,</hi> remain'd yet more aſtoniſh'd, and ask'd her how that Trunk could come into our hands, and what was in it? to which the Renegade, without expecting <hi>Zoraida</hi>'s Anſwer, reply'd, Do not trouble thy ſelf to ask thy Daughter ſo many Queſtions, for with one Word I can ſatisfy them all. Know then that ſhe is a Chriſtian, and 'tis ſhe that has filled off our Chains, and given us Liberty; ſhe is with us by her own conſent, and I hope well pleas'd, as People ſhould be, who come from Darkneſs to Light, and from Death to Life. Is this true, Daughter, ſaid the <hi>Moor?</hi> It is ſo, reply'd <hi>Zoraida.</hi> How then, ſaid the Old Man, art thou really a Chriſtian, and art thou ſhe that has put thy Father into the power of his Enemies? to which <hi>Zoraida</hi> reply'd, I am ſhe that is a Chriſtian, but not ſhe that has brought thee into this Condition; for my deſign never was to injure my Father, but only to do my ſelf good, And what good haſt thou done thy ſelf, ſaid the <hi>Moor?</hi> Ask that of <hi>Lela Marien,</hi> reply'd <hi>Zoraida,</hi> for ſhe can tell thee beſt. The Old Man had no ſooner heard this, but he threw himſelf with incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Fury into the Sea, and without Doubt he had been drown'd in it, had not his Garments, which were ſomewhat large, kept him ſome time above Water. <hi>Zoraida</hi> cry'd out to us to help him, which we all did ſo readily, that we pull'd him out by his Veſt, but half drown'd, and without any feeling. This ſo troubl'd <hi>Zoraida,</hi> that ſhe threw her ſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her Father, and began to lament and take on as if her Father had been really dead. We turn'd him on his Belly, and by the much Water that came out of him he recover'd a little in about two hours time. The Wind in the mean while was come about and forc'd us aſhore, ſo that we were oblig'd to ply our Oars not to be driven upon the Land.
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:54446:284"/>
It was our Fortune that we got into a ſmall Bay, which is made by a Promontory, call'd the Cape of the <hi>Caba Rumia,</hi> which in our Tongue is the Cape of the <hi>wicked Chriſtian Woman;</hi> and it is a Tradition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Moors,</hi> that there lies buried <hi>Caba</hi> the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Count <hi>Julian,</hi> who was the cauſe of the loſs of <hi>Spain;</hi> and they think it Ominous to be forc'd into that Bay, for they never go in otherwiſe than by Neceſſity; but to us it was no unlucky Harbour, but a ſafe Retreat, conſidering how high the Sea went by this time. We poſted our Centries on Shore, but kept our Oars ready to be ply'd upon occaſion, taking in the mean time ſome refreſhment of what the Renegade had provided, praying heartily to God and the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> to protect us, and help us to bring our deſign to a happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. Here at the deſire of <hi>Zoraida</hi> we reſolv'd to ſet her Father on Shore, with all the other <hi>Moors,</hi> whom we kept faſt ty'd; for ſhe had not Courage, nor could her tender Heart ſuffer any longer, to ſee her Father and her Country-men ill us'd before her Eyes; but we did not think to do it before we were juſt ready to depart, and then they could not much hurt us, the Place being a Solitary one, and no Habitations near it. Our Prayers were not in vain, the Wind fell, and the Sea became Calm, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting us thereby to purſue our intended Voyage: We unty'd our Priſoners, and ſet them on Shore one by one, which they were mightily aſtoniſh'd at: When we came to put <hi>Zoraida</hi>'s Father on Shore, who by this time was come to himſelf, he ſaid, Why do you think Chriſtians, that this wicked Woman deſires I ſhould be ſet at Liberty; do you think it is for any Pity ſhe takes of me? No certainly, but it is becauſe ſhe is not able to bear my preſence which hinders the proſecution of her ill Deſires: I wou'd not have you think nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:54446:285"/>
that ſhe has embrac'd your Religion, becauſe ſhe knows the difference between yours and ours, but becauſe ſhe has heard that ſhe may live more looſely in your Country than at Home: And then turning himſelf to <hi>Zoraida,</hi> while I and another held him faſt by the Arms, that he might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no Extravagance, he ſaid, O infamous and blind young Woman, where art thou going in the power of theſe Dogs our natural Enemies? curs'd be the Hour in which I begot thee, and the Care and Affection with which I bred thee. But I, ſeeing he was not like to make an end of his Exclamations ſoon, made haſte to ſet him on Shore, from whence he continu'd to give us his Curſes and Complaints; begging on his Knees of <hi>Mah<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> to beg of God Almighty to confound and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy us; and when, being under Sail, we cou'd no longer hear him, we ſaw his Actions, which were to tear his Hair and his Beard, and roll himſelf upon the Ground; but he once ſtrain'd his Voice ſo high, that we heard what he ſaid, which was, Come back, my dear Daughter, for I forgive thee all; Let thoſe Men have the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which is already in their Poſſeſſion, and do thou return to comfort thy diſconſolate Father, who muſt elſe loſe his Life in theſe Sandy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts. All this <hi>Zoraida</hi> heard, and ſhed abundance of Tears, but cou'd anſwer nothing, but beg that <hi>Lela Marien,</hi> who had made her a Chriſtian, wou'd comfort him. God knows, ſaid ſhe, I cou'd not avoid doing what I have done, and that theſe Chriſtians are not oblig'd to me, for I cou'd not be at reſt till I had done this, which to thee, dear Father, ſeems ſo ill a thing. All this ſhe ſaid, when we were got ſo far out of his hearing, that we cou'd ſcarce ſee him. So I comforted <hi>Zoraida</hi> as well as I cou'd, and we all minded our Voyage.
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:54446:285"/>
The Wind was now ſo right for our purpoſe, that we made no doubt of being the next Morning upon the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Shore; but as it ſeldom happens, that any Felicity comes ſo pure as not to be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd and allay'd by ſome mixture of Sorrow; either our ill Fortune, or the <hi>Moor</hi>'s Curſes had ſuch an effect (for a Father's Curſes are to be dreaded, let the Father be what he will,) that about Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, when we were under full Sail, with our Oars laid by, we ſaw by the light of the Moon hard by us a round Veſſel, with all her Sails out, coming a-head of us, which ſhe did ſo cloſe to us, that we were forc'd to ſtrike our Sail not to run foul of her; and the Veſſel likewiſe ſeem'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to let us go by; they had come ſo near us, to ask from whence we came, and whither we were going? But doing it in <hi>French,</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negade forbid us to anſwer, ſaying, Without doubt theſe are <hi>French</hi> Pirates, to whom every thing is Prize. This made us all be ſilent; and as we ſail'd on, they being under the Wind, let fly two Guns, both as it appear'd, with Chain-ſhot, for one brought our Maſt by the Board, and the other went through us, without killing any Body; but we, perceiving we were ſinking, call'd to them to come and take us, for we were going to be drown'd; they then ſtruck their own Sails, and putting out their Boat, there came about a dozen <hi>French</hi> on Board us, all well arm'd, and their Matches lighted. When they were cloſe to us, ſeeing we were but few, they took us aboard their Boat, ſaying, that this had happen'd to us for not anſwering their Queſtions. The Rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade had time to take the little Coffer or Trunk, full of <hi>Zoraida</hi>'s Treaſure, and heave it over-board, without being perceiv'd by any Body, When we were on board their Veſſel, after having learnt
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:54446:286"/>
from us all they cou'd, they began to ſtrip us, as if we had been their mortal Enemies: They plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd <hi>Zoraida</hi> of all the Jewels and Bracelets ſhe had on her Hands and Feet; and that did not ſo much trouble me, as the apprehenſion I was in for that rich Jewel of her Chaſtity, which ſhe valu'd above all the reſt. But that ſort of People ſeldom have any deſires above the ordinary gains of Riches, which they ſaw in abundance before their Eyes; and their Covetouſneſs was ſo ſharpen'd by it, that even our Slaves Habits tempted them. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted what to do with us; and ſome were of opinion to throw us over-board, wrapt up in a Sail, becauſe they intended to put into ſome of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ports, under the notion of being of <hi>Britany;</hi> and if they carry'd us with them, they might be puniſh'd, and their Roguery come to light: But the Captain, who thought himſelf rich with <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raida</hi>'s Plunder, ſaid he wou'd not touch in any Port of <hi>Spain,</hi> but make his way through the <hi>Streights</hi> by Night, or as he cou'd, for <hi>Rochel,</hi> from whence he came. This being reſolv'd, they found out the expedient of giving us their Long-boat, and all we might want of Proviſion for our ſhort Navigation. As ſoon as it was Day, and that we deſcry'd the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Shore, (at which ſight, ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable a thing is Liberty, all our Miſeries vaniſh'd from our Thoughts in a Moment,) they began to prepare things, and about Noon they put us on Board, giving us two Barrels of Water, and a ſmall quantity of Bisket; and the Captain, touch'd with ſome remorſe for the lovely <hi>Zoraida,</hi> gave her at parting about 40 Crowns in Gold, and would not ſuffer his Soldiers to take from her thoſe very Cloaths which now ſhe has on. We went aboard, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves rather thankful than complaining. They got out to Sea, making for the <hi>Streights,</hi> and
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:54446:286"/>
we having the Land before us for our North Star, ply'd our Oars, ſo that about Sun-ſet we were near enough to have Landed before it was quite dark; but conſidering the Moon was hid in Clouds, and the Heavens were growing Dark, and we ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the Shore, we did not think it ſafe to venture on it, tho' many among us were ſo deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of Liberty, and to be out of all Danger, that they wou'd have landed, tho' on a deſart Rock; and by that means at leaſt we might avoid all little Barks of the Pyrates of the <hi>Barbary</hi> Coaſt, ſuch as thoſe of <hi>Tetuan,</hi> who come from home when 'tis dark, and by Morning are early upon the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Coaſt; where they often make a Prize, and go home to Bed the ſame Day. But the other opinion prevail'd, which was to Row gently on, and if the Sea and Shore gave leave, to Land quietly where we cou'd. We did accordingly, and about Midnight we came under a great Hill, which had a ſandy Shore, convenient enough for our Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Here we run our Boat in as far as we cou'd; and being got on Land, we all kiſſed it for joy, and thank'd God with Tears for our Deliverance. This done, we took out the little Proviſion we had left, and climb'd up the Mountain, thinking our ſelves more in ſurety, for we could hardly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade our ſelves, nor believe that the Land we were upon was the Chriſtian Shore. We thought the Day long a coming, and then we got to the top of the Hill, to ſee if we could diſcover any Habitations; but we could no where deſcry either Houſe or Perſon, or Path. We reſolv'd however to go further in, as thinking we could not miſs at laſt of ſome Body to inform us where we were; that which troubl'd me moſt was, to ſee my poor <hi>Zoraida</hi> go on Foot among the ſharp Rocks, and I would ſometimes have carry'd her on my Should<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:54446:287"/>
but ſhe was as much concern'd at the pains I took, as ſhe could be at what ſhe endur'd; ſo leaning on me, ſhe went on with much patience and content. When we had gone about a quarter of a League we heard the ſound of a little Pipe, which we took to be a certain ſign of ſome Flock near us; and looking well about, we perceiv'd at laſt at the foot of a Cork-Tree a young Shepherd, who was cutting a Stick with his Knife with great Attention and Repoſe. We call'd to him, and he having look'd up, ran away as hard as he could. It ſeems, as we afterwards heard, the firſt he ſaw were the Renegade and <hi>Zoraida,</hi> who being in the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Dreſs, he thought all the <hi>Moors</hi> in <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary</hi> were upon him; and running into the Wood, cry'd all the way as loud he could, <hi>Moors, Moors,</hi> Arm, Arm, the <hi>Moors</hi> are Landed. We hearing this out-cry, did not well know what to do? But conſidering that the Shepherd's out-cries could on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raiſe the Country, and that the Horſe-guard of the Coaſt would be upon us, we agreed that the Renegade ſhould pull off his <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Habit, and ſhould put on a Slave's Coat, which one of us lent him, though he that lent it him, remain'd in his Shirt. Thus, recommending our ſelves to God, we went on by the ſame way that the Shepherd ran, ſtill expecting when the Horſe would come upon us; and we were not deceiv'd, for in leſs than two Hours, as we came down the Hills into a Plain, we diſcover'd about fifty Horſe coming upon a half Gallop towards us; when we ſaw that, we ſtood ſtill, expecting of them; when they came up, and inſtead of ſo many <hi>Moors,</hi> ſaw ſo many poor Chriſtian Captives they were aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, one of them ask'd us if we were the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion that a young Shepherd had given the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm to the Country? Yes, ſaid I, and upon that
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:54446:287"/>
began to tell him who we were, and whence we came; but one of our Company knew the Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that had ask'd us the Queſtion, and without letting me go on ſaid, God be prais'd, Gentlemen, for bringing us to ſo good a part of the Country, for if I miſtake not, we are near the <hi>Velez de Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laga,</hi> and if the many Years of my Captivity have not taken my Memory from me too, I think, that you, Sir, who ask us theſe Queſtions, are my Uncle <hi>Don Pedro Buſtamante.</hi> The Chriſtian Slave had hardly ſaid this, but the Gentleman lighting from his Horſe, came haſtily to embrace the young Slave, ſaying dear Nephew, my Joy, my Life, I know thee, and have often lamented thy Loſs, with thy dear Mother and thy other Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whom thou wilt yet find alive. God has preſerv'd them, that they may have the pleaſure of ſeeing thee. We had heard thou were in <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers,</hi> and by what I ſee of thy Dreſs, and that of all this Company, you muſt all have had ſome Miraculous Deliverance. It is ſo, reply'd the young Man, and we ſhall have time enough now to tell all our Adventures. The reſt of the Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men hearing we were Chriſtians eſcap'd from Slavery, lighted likewiſe from their Horſes, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to us to carry us to the Town of <hi>Velez de Malaga,</hi> which was about a League and a half off. Some of them went where we had left our Boat, and got it into the Port. We got behind ſome of them, and <hi>Zoraida</hi> behind the Gentleman, Uncle to our Captive. All the People, who had already heard ſomething of our Adventure, came out to meet us; they did not wonder to ſee Captives at Liberty, nor <hi>Moors</hi> Priſoners; for in all that Coaſt they are us'd to it; but they were aſtoniſh'd at the Beauty of <hi>Zoraida,</hi> which at that Inſtant ſeem'd to be in its point of Perfection; for, as
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:54446:288"/>
well with the agitation of travelling, as with the joy of being ſafe in Chriſtendom, without the terrible thought of being re-taken, ſhe had ſuch a beautiful Colour in her Countenance, that were it not for fear of being too partial, I durſt ſay there was not a more beautiful Creature in the World, at leaſt that I had ſeen. We went ſtraight to the Church, to thank God for his great Mercy to us; and as we came into it, and that <hi>Zoraida</hi> had look'd upon the Pictures, ſhe ſaid there were ſeveral Faces there that were like <hi>Lela Marien</hi>'s; we told her they were her Pictures, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negade explain'd to her as well as he could the Story of them, that ſhe might adore them, as if in reality each of them had been the true <hi>Lela Marien,</hi> who had ſpoke to her; and ſhe, who has a good and clear Underſtanding, comprehended im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately all that was ſaid about the Pictures and Images. After this, we were diſpers'd, and lodg'd in different Houſes of the Town, but the young Chriſtian Slave of <hi>Velez</hi> carry'd me, <hi>Zoraida,</hi> and the Renegade to his Father's Houſe, where we were Accommodated pretty well, according to their Fortune, and us'd with as much kindneſs as their own Son. After ſix Days ſtay at <hi>Velez,</hi> the Renegade having made Proofs of his Honeſty, went to <hi>Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> there to be receiv'd by the holy Inquiſition into the Boſom of the Church. <hi>Zoraida</hi> and I remained without other help than the forty Crowns which the Pirate gave her, with which I bought this Aſs on which ſhe rides; and hitherto have been to her a Father and a Friend, but not a Husband: We go with an Intention of ſeeing whether my Father be alive, or any of my Brothers has had better Fortune than I; tho' ſince it has pleas'd Heaven to give me <hi>Zoraida,</hi> and make me her Partner, I reckon no better Fortune could befall me. The Patience
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:54446:288"/>
with which ſhe bears the inconvenience of Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the deſire ſhe ſhews of being made a Chriſtian, do give me Subject of continual Admiration, and oblige me to ſerve and love her all the Days of my Life. I confeſs, the expectation of being Hers is not a little allay'd with the uncertainties of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether I ſhall find in my Country any one to receive us, or a Corner to paſs my Life with her; and perhaps Time will have ſo alter'd the Affairs of our Family, that I ſhall not find any Body that will know me, if my Father and Brothers are Dead.</p>
                           <p>This is, Gentlemen, the ſum of my Adventures, which if it has any thing entertaining, you are beſt Judges. I wiſh I had told them more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiouſly; and yet, I aſſure you, the fear of being tedious has made me cut ſhort many Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of my Story.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> An Account of what happen'd afterwards in the Inn, with ſeveral other Occurrences worth Notice.</head>
                           <p>HERE the Stranger ended his Story, and Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> making him a Compliment in the behalf of the whole Company, Truly, Captain, ſaid he, the wonderful and ſurprizing turns of your Fortune are not only entertaining, but the pleaſing and graceful manner of your Relation is as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary as the Adventures themſelves; we are all bound to pay you our Acknowledgements; and
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:54446:289"/>
I believe we could be delighted with a ſecond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital, though 'twere to laſt till to Morrow, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it were made by you. <hi>Cardenio</hi> and the reſt of the Company joyn'd with him in offering their utmoſt Service in the re-eſtabliſhment of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and that with ſo much ſincerity and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that the Captain had reaſon to be ſatisfied of their Affection. Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> particularly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to engage the Marqueſs his Brother to ſtand God-father to <hi>Zoraida,</hi> if he would return with him; and farther, promis'd to provide him with all things neceſſary to ſupport his Figure and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in Town; but the Captain making them a very handſome Compliment for their obliging Favours, excus'd himſelf from accepting thoſe kind offers at that time. By this time it grew to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the dark of the Evening, when a Coach ſtopp'd at the Inn, and with it ſome Horſe-men, who ask'd for a Lodging. The Hoſteſs anſwer'd, that they were as full as they could pack. Were you ten times fuller, anſwer'd one of the Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, here muſt be room made for my Lord Judge, who is in this Coach. The Hoſteſs hearing this was very much concern'd; ſaid ſhe, as ill luck will have it, we have not one Bed empty in the Houſe; but if his Lordſhip brings a Bed with him, as perhaps he may, he ſhall command my Houſe with all my Heart, and I and my Husband will quit our own Chamber to ſerve him; do ſo then, ſaid the Man: And by this time a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man alighted from the Coach, eaſily diſtinguiſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a Man of Dignity and Office by his long Gown and great Sleeves. He led a young Lady by the Hand, about ſixteen Years of Age, dreſs'd in a riding Suit; her Beauty and charming Air at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the Eyes of every Body with Admiration, and had not the other Ladies been preſent, any
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:54446:289"/>
one might have thought it difficult to have match'd her outward Graces.</p>
                           <p>Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ſeeing them come near the Door. Sir, ſaid he, you may enter undiſmay'd, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh your ſelf in this Caſtle, which tho' little, and indifferently provided, muſt nevertheleſs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low room, and afford accommodation to Arms and Learning, and more eſpecially to Arms and Learning, that like yours, bring Beauty for their Guide and Conductor. For certainly at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of this lovely Damſel, not only Caſtles ought to open and expand their Gates; but even Rocks divide their ſolid Bodies, and Mountains bow their Ambitious Creſts, to make her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and afford her a Retreat. Enter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Sir, this Paradiſe, where you ſhall find a bright Conſtellation, worthy to ſhine in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with that Heaven of Beauty which you bring: Here ſhall you find Arms in their height, and Beauty in Perfection. Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Speech, Mien, and Garb, put the Judge to a ſtrange Non-plus; and he was not a little ſurpriz'd on t'other Hand at the ſudden appearance of the Three La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, who being inform'd of the Judge's coming, and the young Lady's Beauty, were come out to ſee and entertain her. But Don <hi>Ferdinand, Cardenio,</hi> and the Curate, addreſſing him in a Style very different from the Knight, ſoon convinc'd him that he had to do with Gentlemen, and Perſons of Note, tho' Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Figure and Behaviour put him to a ſtand, not being able to make any reaſonable conjecture of his Extravagance. After the uſual Civilities paſs'd on both Sides, they found upon examination that the Women muſt all lye together in Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Apartment, and the Men remain without to guard them. The Judge conſenting that his Daughter ſhou'd wait
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:54446:290"/>
on the Ladies, he remain'd contented with his own Bed, and part of the Inn-keeper's for himſelf and the Gentlemen, and ſo made a ſhift to paſs the Night.</p>
                           <p>The Captain, upon the firſt ſight of the Judge, had a ſtrong preſumption that he was one of his Brothers, and preſently ask'd one of his Servants his Name and Country. The Fellow told him, his Name was <hi>Juan Perez de Viedma,</hi> and that, as he was inform'd, he was born in the Highlands of <hi>Leon.</hi> This, with his own Obſervations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd his Opinion, that this was the Brother who had made Study his Choice; whereupon calling aſide Don <hi>Ferdinand, Cardenio,</hi> and the Curate, he told them with great Joy what he had learn'd, with what the Servant further told him, that his Maſter being made a Judge of the Court of <hi>Mexico,</hi> was then upon his Journey to the <hi>Indies;</hi> that the young Lady was his only Daughter, whoſe Mother dy'd in Child-birth, ſettl'd her Dowry upon her Daughter for a Portion, and that the Father had ſtill liv'd a Widower, and was very Rich. Upon the whole Matter, he ask'd their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, whether they thought it proper for him to diſcover himſelf preſently to his Brother, or by ſome means try how his Pulſe beat firſt in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his loſs, by which he might gueſs at his Reception. Why ſhould you doubt of a kind one, Sir, ſaid the Curate? Becauſe I am poor, Sir, ſaid the Captain, and would therefore by ſome device fathom his Affections; for ſhould he prove aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to own me, I ſhould be more aſham'd to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover my ſelf. Then leave the Management to me, ſaid the Curate; the Affable and courteous Behaviour of the Judge ſeems to me ſo very far from Pride, that you need not doubt a Welcome; but however, becauſe you deſire it, I engage to
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:54446:290"/>
find a way to found him. Supper was now upon the Table, and all the Gentlemen ſat down, but the Captain, who eat with the Ladies in the next Room; when the Company had half Supp'd, My Lord Judge, ſaid the Curate, I remember about ſome years ago I was happy in the acquaintance and friendſhip of a Gentleman of your Name when I was Priſoner in <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> he was a Captain of as much Worth and Courage as any in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Infantry, but as unfortunate as brave. What was his Name, pray Sir, ſaid the Judge? <hi>Ruy Perez de Viedma,</hi> anſwer'd the Curate, of a Town in the Mountains of <hi>Leon.</hi> I remember he told me a very odd Paſſage, between his Father, his two Brothers, and himſelf; and truly had it come from any Man below his unſuſpected Credit and Reputation, I ſhould have thought it no more than a Story: He ſaid, that his Father made an equal dividend of his Eſtate among his three Sons, giving them ſuch Advice as might have fitted the Mouth of <hi>Cato;</hi> that he made Arms his choice, and with ſuch ſucceſs, that within a few Years (by the pure Merit of his Bravery) he was made Captain of a Foot-Company, and had a fair proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of being advanc'd to a Colonel; but his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune forſook him, where he had moſt reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect her Favour; for, in the memorable Battel of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> where ſo many Chriſtians recover'd their Liberty, he unfortunately loſt his. I was taken at <hi>Goletta,</hi> and after different turns of Fortune we became Companions at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> thence we were carry'd to <hi>Algiers,</hi> where one of the moſt ſtrange Adventures in the World befell this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman. The Curate then briefly ran through the whole Story of the Captain and <hi>Zoraida,</hi> (the Judge ſitting all the time more attentive than he ever did on the Bench) to their being taken and ſtripp'd
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:54446:291"/>
by the <hi>French;</hi> and that he had heard nothing of them after that, nor could ever learn whether they came into <hi>Spain,</hi> or were carry'd Priſoners into <hi>France.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Captain ſtood liſt'ning in a Corner, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd the Motions of his Brother's Countenance, while the Curate told his Story: Which, when he had finiſh'd, the Judge breathing out a deep ſigh, and the Tears ſtanding in his Eyes: O Sir, ſaid he, if you knew how nearly your Relation touches me, you would eaſily excuſe the violent Eruption of theſe Tears. The Captain you ſpoke of is my eldeſt Brother, who, being of a ſtronger Conſtitution of Body, and more elevated Soul, made the Glory and Fame of War his Choice, which was one of the three Propoſals made by my Father, as your Companion told you. I apply'd my ſelf to Study, and my younger Brother has purchas'd a vaſt Eſtate in <hi>Peru,</hi> out of which he has tranſmitted to my Father, enough to ſupport his liberal Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and to me wherewithal to continue my Studies, and advance my ſelf to the Rank and Authority which now I maintain. My Father is ſtill alive, but dies daily for grief he can learn nothing of his eldeſt Care; and importunes Heaven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly that he may once more ſee him before Death cloſe his Eyes. 'Tis very ſtrange, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his diſcretion in other Matters, that neither Proſperity nor Adverſity could draw one Line from him, to give his Father an account of his Fortunes. For had he or we had the leaſt hint of his Captivity, he needed not have ſtaid for the Miracle of the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Lady's Cane for his Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Now am I in the greateſt uneaſineſs in the World, leaſt the <hi>French,</hi> the better to conceal their Robbery, may have kill'd him; the thoughts of this will damp the pleaſure of my Voyage, which
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:54446:291"/>
I thought to proſecute ſo pleaſantly. Could I but gueſs, dear Brother, continu'd he, where you might be found, I would hazard Life and Fortune for your Deliverance. Could our aged Father once underſtand you were alive, though hidden in the deepeſt and darkeſt Dungeon in <hi>Barbary,</hi> his Eſtate, mine, and my Brother's, all ſhould fly for your Ranſom. And for the Fair and Liberal <hi>Zoraida,</hi> what thanks, what recompence could we provide? O, might I ſee the happy Day of her Spiritual Birth and Baptiſm, to ſee her joyn'd to him in Faith and Marriage, how ſhould we all rejoyce! Theſe and ſuch like Expreſſions the Judge utter'd with ſo much paſſion and vehemency, that he mov'd a concern in every body.</p>
                           <p>The Curate, foreſeeing the hapyy Succeſs of his Deſign, reſolv'd to prolong the diſcovery no farther; and to free the Company from ſuſpence, he went to the Lady's Room, and leading out <hi>Zoraida,</hi> follow'd by the reſt, he took the Captain by t'other hand, and preſenting them to the Judge; ſuppreſs your Grief, my Lord, ſaid he, and glut your Heart with Joy, behold what you ſo paſſionately deſir'd, your dear Brother, and his fair Deliverer; this Gentleman is Captain <hi>Viedma,</hi> and this the Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Algerine;</hi> the <hi>French</hi> have only reduc'd them to this low Condition, to make Room for your Generous Sentiments and Liberality. The Captain then approaching to embrace, the Judge held him off with both his hands, to view him well; but once knowing him, he flew into his Arms with ſuch Affection, and ſuch abundance of Tears, that all the Spectators ſympathiz'd in his Paſſions. The Brothers ſpoke ſo feelingly, and their mutual Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection was ſo moving, the ſurprize ſo wonderful, and their Joy ſo tranſporting, that it muſt be left purely to imagination to conceive. Now they tell
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:54446:292"/>
one another the ſtrange turns and mazes of their Fortunes, then renew their Careſſes to the height of Brotherly tenderneſs. Now the Judge embraces <hi>Zoraida,</hi> then makes her an Offer of his whole Fortune; next makes his Daughter embrace her; then the ſweet and innocent converſe of the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Chriſtian, and the lovely <hi>Moor,</hi> ſo touch'd the whole Company, that they all wept for Joy. In the mean time Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was very ſolidly atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and wond'ring at theſe ſtrange Occurrences, attributed them purely to ſomething anſwerable to the Chimerical Notions which are incident to Chivalry. The Captain and <hi>Zoraida</hi> in concert with the whole Company, reſolv'd to return with their Brother to <hi>Sevil,</hi> and thence to adviſe their Father of his Arrival and Liberty, that the old Gentleman ſhould make the beſt ſhift he could to get ſo far to ſee the Baptiſm and Marriage of <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raida,</hi> while the Judge took his Voyage to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> being oblig'd to make no delay, becauſe the <hi>Indian</hi> Fleet were ready at <hi>Sevil,</hi> to ſet Sail in a Month for <hi>New-Spain.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Every thing being now ſettl'd, to the univerſal ſatisfaction of the Company, and being very late, they all agreed for Bed, only Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> who muſt neceſſarily Guard the Caſtle whilſt they ſlept, leſt ſome Tyrant or Giant, covetous of the great Treaſure of Beauty which it inclos'd, ſhould make ſome dangerous Attempt. He had the Thanks of the Houſe, and the Judge being farther inform'd of his Humour, laugh'd very heartily. <hi>Sancho Pança</hi> was very uneaſie and waſpiſh for want of ſleep, tho' the beſt provided with a Bed, beſtowing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on his Pack-Saddle; but he paid dearly for it, as we ſhall hear preſently. The Ladies being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd to their Chamber, and every body elſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn to reſt, and Don <hi>Quixote</hi> planted Centinel
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:54446:292"/>
at the Caſtle-Gate, the Ladies heard of a ſudden, ſome body ſinging ſo ſweetly, that he allur'd all their Attentions, but chiefly <hi>Dorothea</hi>'s with whom the Judge's Daughter <hi>Donna Clara de Viedma</hi> lay. None could imagine, who could make ſuch pretty Muſick without an Inſtrument; ſometimes it ſounded as from the Yard, ſometimes as from the Stable. With this <hi>Cardenio</hi> knock'd ſoftly at their Door, Ladies, Ladies, ſaid he, are you awake; Can you ſleep when ſo charmingly Serenaded? Don't you hear how ſweetly one of the Foot-men ſings? Yes, Sir, ſaid <hi>Dorothea,</hi> we hear him plainly. Then <hi>Dorothea</hi> hearkning as attentively as ſhe could, heard this Song.</p>

                              <hi>Dorothea</hi> thought it wou'd not be much amiſs to give <hi>Donna Clara</hi> the opportunity of hearing ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a Voice, wherefore jogging her gently, firſt on one ſide and then on to'ther, and the young Lady waking, I ask your Pardon, my Dear, cry'd <hi>Dorothea,</hi> for thus interrupting your repoſe; and I hope you'll eaſily forgive me, ſince I only wake you that you may have the pleaſure of hearing one of the moſt charming Voices, that poſſibly you ever heard in your Life. <hi>Donna Clara,</hi> who was hardly awake, did not perfectly underſtand what <hi>Dorothea</hi> ſaid, and therefore deſir'd her to repeat what ſhe ſpoke to her before; <hi>Dorothea</hi> did ſo; which then oblig'd <hi>Donna Clara,</hi> alſo to liſten, but ſcarce had ſhe heard the early Muſician ſing two Verſes, e'er ſhe was taken with a ſtrange trembling, as if ſhe had been ſeiz'd with a violent ſit of a Quartan Ague, and then cloſely embracing <hi>Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea,</hi> Ah! dear Madam, cry'd ſhe, with a ſigh, why did you wake me? Alaſs! the greateſt happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I cou'd now have expected, had been to have ſtopt my Ears. That unhappy Muſician! How's this, my dear, cry'd <hi>Dorothea</hi> have you not heard, that the young Lad who ſung now, is but a Mule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer? Oh no, he's no ſuch thing, reply'd <hi>Clara,</hi> but a young Lord, heir to a great Eſtate, and has ſuch a full poſſeſſion of my Heart, that if he does not ſlight it, it muſt be his for ever. <hi>Dorothea</hi> was
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:54446:293"/>
ſtrangely ſurpriz'd at the young Lady's paſſionate Expreſſions, that ſeem'd far to exceed thoſe of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of her tender Years: You ſpeak ſo myſteriouſly, Madam, reply'd ſhe, that I can't rightly underſtand you, unleſs you will pleaſe to let me know more plainly, what you wou'd ſay of Hearts and Sighs, and this young Muſician, whoſe Voice has caus'd ſo great an alteration in you. However ſpeak no more of 'em now; for I'm reſolv'd I'll not loſe the pleaſure of hearing him ſing. Hold, continu'd ſhe, I fancy he's going to entertain us with another Song. With all my Heart, return'd <hi>Clara,</hi> and with that ſhe ſtopt her Ears, that ſhe might not hear him; at which again <hi>Dorothea</hi> cou'd not chooſe but admire; but liſt'ning to his Voice, ſhe heard the following Song.</p>

                           <p>Here the Voice ended, and <hi>Donna Clara</hi>'s Sighs began; which caus'd the greateſt curioſity imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in <hi>Dorothea,</hi> to know the occaſion of ſo moving a Song, and of ſo ſad a Complaint; wherefore ſhe then entreated her to purſue the diſcourſe ſhe had begun before. Then <hi>Clara,</hi> fearing <hi>Lucinda</hi> wou'd over-hear her, getting as near <hi>Dorothea</hi> as was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, laid her Mouth ſo cloſe to <hi>Dorothea</hi>'s Ear, that ſhe was out of danger of being underſtood by any other, and began in this manner. He who ſung is a Gentleman's Son of <hi>Aragon,</hi> his Father is a great Lord, and dwelt juſt over againſt my Father's at Court, and tho' our Windows in the Winter were, cover'd with Oil'd-cloath, and in the Summer ſhaded with Latice, yet (I can't tell by what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident) this young Gentleman, who then went to School, had a ſight of me, and whether it were at Church, or at ſome other place, I can't juſtly tell
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:54446:294"/>
you; but, (in ſhort) he fell in love with me, and made me ſenſible of his Paſſion from his own Windows, which were oppoſite to mine, with ſo many ſigns, and ſuch ſhowers of Tears, that at once forc'd me both to believe and to love him, not knowing how great his Paſſion was for me. Amongſt the uſual ſigns that he made me, one was that of joyning his Hands together, intimating by that his deſire to Marry me; which, tho' I heartily wiſh'd, I cou'd not communicate to any one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Motherleſs, and having none near me whom I might truſt with the management of ſuch an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair; and was therefore conſtrain'd to bear it in ſilence, without permitting him any other favour, more than to let him gaze on me, by lifting up the Latice or Oil'd Cloath a little when my Father and his were abroad. At which he wou'd be ſo tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported with joy, that you wou'd certainly have thought he had been diſtracted. At laſt, my Father's buſineſs call'd him away; yet not ſo ſoon, but that the young Gentleman had notice of it ſome time before his departure; whence he had it I know not, for 'twas impoſſible for me to acquaint him with it. This ſo ſenſibly afflicted him, as far as I underſtand, that he fell ſick; ſo that I cou'd not get a ſight of him all that day of our departure, ſo much as to look a Farewel on him. But after Two days travel, juſt as we came into an Inn, in a Village a days journey hence, I ſaw him at the Lodging-door, dreſs'd ſo exactly like a Muleteer, that it had been utterly impoſſible for me to have known him, had not his perfect Image been ſtamp'd in my Soul. Yes, yes, dear Madam, I knew him, and was amaz'd and over-joy'd at his ſight; and he ſaw me unknown to my Father, whoſe ſight he carefully avoids, when we croſs the ways in our Journey, and when we come to any Inn: And
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:54446:295"/>
now, ſince I know what he is, and what pain and fatigue it muſt neceſſarily be to him to travel thus far a-foot, I am ready to dye my ſelf with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of what he ſuffers; and wherever he ſets his Feet there I ſet my Eyes. I can't imagine what he propoſes to himſelf in this attempt; nor by what means he cou'd thus make his eſcape from his Father, who loves him beyond Expreſſion; both becauſe he has no other Son to inherit, and becauſe the young Gentleman's Merits oblige him to it; which you muſt needs confeſs when you ſee him: And I dare affirm beſide, that all he has ſung was his own immediate thought; for, as I have heard, he is an excellent Scholar, and a great Poet. And now, whenever I ſee him, or hear him ſing, I ſtart and tremble, as at the ſight of a Ghoſt, leſt my Father ſhou'd know him, and ſo be inform'd of our mutual affection. I never ſpoke one word to him in my Life; yet I love him ſo dearly, that 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible I ſhould live without him. This, dear Madam, is all the account I can give you of this Muſician, with whoſe voice you have been ſo well entertain'd, and which alone might convince you that he is no Muleteer, as you were pleas'd to ſay, but one who is Maſter of a great Eſtate, and of my poor Heart, as I have already told you.</p>
                           <p>Enough, dear Madam, reply'd <hi>Dorothea,</hi> kiſſing her a thouſand times: 'Tis very well, compoſe your ſelf till day-light; and then I truſt in Heaven I ſhall ſo manage your Affairs, that the end of them ſhall be as fortunate as the beginning is innocent. Alas! Madam, return'd <hi>Clara,</hi> what end can I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to my ſelf; ſince his Father is ſo rich, and of ſo Noble a Family, that he will hardly think me worthy to be his Son's Servant, much leſs his Wife? And then again, I would not Mary without my Father's Conſent for the Univerſe. All I can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:54446:295"/>
is, that the young Gentleman would return home, and leave his purſuit of me: Happily, by a long abſence, and the great diſtance of Place, the pain which now ſo much afflicts me, may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what mitigated; tho', I fear what I now propoſe as a Remedy, would rather increaſe my Diſtemper: Though I can't imagine whence, or by what means this Paſſion for him ſeiz'd me, ſince we are both ſo young, being much about the ſame Age, I believe, and my Father ſays I ſhan't be ſixteen till next <hi>Michaelmas. Dorothea</hi> could not forbear laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hear the young Lady talk ſo innocently. My Dear, (ſaid <hi>Dorothea</hi>) let us repoſe our ſelf the little remaining part of the Night, and when Day appears, we will put a happy period to your Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows; or my Judgment fails me. Then they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd themſelves again to ſleep, and there was a deep ſilence throughout all the Inn; only the Inn-keeper's Daughter and <hi>Maritornes</hi> were awake, who knowing Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s peccant Humour very well, and that he ſat Arm'd on Horſe-back, keeping Guard without doors, a fancy took 'em, and they agreed to have a little paſtime with him, and hear ſome of his fine raving Speeches.</p>
                           <p>You muſt know then, that there was but one Window in all the Inn that look'd out into the Field, and that was only a hole, out of which they us'd to throw their Straw: To this ſame hole then came theſe two demy Ladies, whence they ſaw Don <hi>Quixote</hi> Mounted, and leaning on his Javelin, and often fetching ſuch mournful and deep ſighs, that his very Soul ſeem'd to be torn from him at each of them: They obſerv'd beſides, that he ſaid in a ſoft amorous tone, <q>O, my Divine <hi>Dulcinea</hi> of <hi>Toboſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 </hi> The Heaven of all Perfections! The End and Quinteſſence of Diſcretion! The Treaſury of ſweet Aſpect and Behaviour! The Magazine of
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:54446:296"/>
Vertue! And, in a Word, The Idea of all that is Profitable, Modeſt, or Delightful in the Univerſe! What noble thing employs thy Excellency at this preſent? May I preſume to hope that thy Soul is entertain'd with the thoughts of thy Captive-Knight, who voluntarily expoſes himſelf to ſo many Dangers for thy ſake? O thou Triformed Luminary, give me ſome account of her! perhaps thou art now gazing with Envy on her as ſhe's walking either through ſome ſtately Gallery of her ſumptuous Palaces, or leaning on her happy Window, there meditating how, with ſafety of her Honour and Grandeur, ſhe may ſweeten and alleviate the Torture which my poor afflicted Heart ſuffers for love of her; with what Glories ſhe ſhall Crown my Pains, what Reſt ſhe ſhall give to my Cares, what Life to my Death, and what Reward to my Services? And thou, more glorious Planet, which, by this time I preſume, art harneſſing thy Horſes to pay thy earlieſt Viſit to my Adorable <hi>Dulcinea;</hi> I entreat thee, aſſoon as thou doſt ſee her, to Salute her with my moſt profound Reſpects: But take heed, that when thou look'ſt on her, and addreſſeſt thy ſelf to her, that thou doſt not kiſs her Face; for if thou doſt, I ſhall grow more Jealous of thee, than ever thou wert of the ſwift Ingrate, who made thee run and ſweat ſo over the Plains of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> or the Banks of <hi>Peneus:</hi> I have forgotten through which of them thou ran'ſt ſo raging with Love and Jealouſie.</q> At theſe Words the Inn-keeper's Daughter began to call to him ſoftly: Sir Knight, ſaid ſhe, come a little nearer this way, if you pleaſe. At theſe Words Don <hi>Quixote</hi> turn'd his head, and the Moon ſhining then very bright, he perceiv'd ſome body call'd him from the hole, which he fancy'd was a large Window full of Iron-Bars, all
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:54446:296"/>
richly gilt, ſuitable to the ſtately Caſtle, for which he miſtook the Inn; and all on a ſudden, he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd that the Beautiful Damſel, Daughter to the Lady of the Caſtle, overcome by the Charms of his Perſon, return'd to court him, as ſhe did once before. In this thought, that he might not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear uncivil or ungrateful, he turn'd <hi>Rozinante</hi> and came to the Hole, where ſeeing the two Laſſes, Fair Damſels, ſaid he, I cannot but pity you in your miſplac'd Affection, ſince it is altogether impoſſible you ſhould meet with any return from the object of your Wiſhes proportionable to your great Merits and Beauty; but yet you ought not by any means to condemn this unhappy Knight-Errant for this Coldneſs, ſince Love has utterly incapacitated him to become a Captive to any other but to her, who, at firſt ſight, made her ſelf abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Miſtreſs of his Soul. Pardon me therefore, excellent Lady, and retire to your Apartment. Let not, I beſeech you, any farther Arguments of Love force me to be leſs Grateful or Civil than I would: But if in your Paſſion you have for me, you can bethink your ſelf of any thing elſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I may do you any Service, Love alone except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Command it freely; and I ſwear to you by my abſent, yet moſt charming Enemy, to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it to you immediately; though it be a Lock of <hi>Meduſa</hi>'s Hair, which are all Snakes, or the very Sun-beams enclos'd in a Glaſs-vial.</p>

                           <p>He ſtood then as I ſaid on <hi>Rozinante</hi>'s Saddle, with all his Arm drawn into the Hole, and the Rope faſten'd to the Lock, being under a fearful apprehenſion, that if <hi>Rozinante</hi> mov'd but never ſo little on any ſide, he ſhould ſlip and hang by the Arm, and therefore durſt not uſe the leaſt motion in the World, though he might reaſonably have expected from <hi>Rozinante</hi>'s Patience and gentle Temper, that if he were not urg'd, he would never have mov'd for a whole Age together of his own accord. In ſhort, the Knight perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf faſt, and that the Ladies had forſaken him, immediately concluded that all this was done by way of Inchantment, as in the laſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture in the very ſame Caſtle, when the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted <hi>Moor</hi> (the Carrier) did ſo damnably mawl him. Then he began alone to curſe his want of Diſcretion and Conduct, ſince, having once made his eſcape out of that Caſtle in ſo miſerable a condition, he ſhould venture into it a ſecond time: For, by the way, 'twas an Obſervation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all Knights-Errant, That if they were once foil'd in an Adventure, 'twas a certain ſign it was not reſerv'd for them, but for ſome other to finiſh; wherefore they would never prove it again. Yet for all this, he ventur'd to draw back his Arm, to try if he could free himſelf; but he was ſo faſt bound, that his attempt prov'd fruitleſs. 'Tis true, 'twas with care and deliberation he drew it, for fear <hi>Rozinante</hi> ſhould ſtir: And then fain would he have ſeated himſelf in the Saddle, but he found he muſt either ſtand, or leave his
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:54446:299"/>
Arm for a Ranſom. A hundred times he wiſh'd for <hi>Amadis</hi>'s Sword, on which no Inchantment had power; then he fell a curſing his Stars; then reflected on the great loſs the World would ſuſtain all the time he ſhould continue under this Inchantment, as he really believ'd it: Then his Adorable <hi>Dulcinea</hi> came afreſh into his thoughts: Many a time did he call to his Truſty Squire <hi>Sancho Pança;</hi> who, bury'd in a profound Sleep, lay ſtretch'd at length on his Aſs's Pannel, never ſo much as dreaming of the pangs his Mother felt when ſhe bore him: Then the Aid of the Necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancers <hi>Lirgandeo</hi> and <hi>Aquife</hi> was Invok'd by the unhappy Knight. And, in fine, the Morning ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd him, rack'd with Deſpair and Confuſion, bellowing like a Bull; for he could not hope from Day-light any Cure, or mitigation of his Pain, which he believ'd would be eternal, being abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely perſwaded he was Inchanted, ſince he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd that <hi>Rozinante</hi> mov'd no more than a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; and therefore he was of Opinion, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he nor his Horſe ſhould eat, drink, or ſleep, but remain in that State, till the Malignancy of the Stars were o'erpaſt, or till ſome more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Magician ſhould break the Charm.</p>
                           <p>But 'twas an erroneous Opinion; for it was ſcarce Day-break, when Four Horſe-men, very well accoutred, their Fire-locks hanging at the Pummels of their Saddles, came thither, and finding the Inn-gate ſhut, call'd and knock'd very loud and hard; which Don <hi>Quixote</hi> perceiving from the Poſt where he ſtood Centinel, cry'd out, with a rough Voice and a haughty Mien, Knights or Squires, or of whatſoever other Degree you are, knock no more at the Gates of this Caſtle! Since you may aſſure your ſelves, that thoſe who are within at ſuch an Hour as this, are either taking their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:54446:299"/>
or are not accuſtom'd to open their Fortreſs, till <hi>Phoebus</hi> has diſplay'd himſelf upon the Globe: Retire therefore, and wait till it is clear Day, and then we will ſee whether 'tis juſt or no, that they ſhou'd open their Gates to you. What a Devil (cry'd one of 'em) what Caſtle or Fortreſs is this, that we ſhou'd be oblig'd to ſo long a Ceremony? Prithee, Friend, if thou art the Inn-keeper, bid them open the Door to us: For we ride Poſt, and can ſtay no longer than juſt to bait our Horſes. Gentlemen, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> do I look like an Inn-keeper then? I can't tell what thou'rt like, reply'd another, but I am ſure, thou talkeſt like a Mad-man, to call this Inn a Caſtle. It is a Caſtle, return'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> ay, and one of the beſt in the Province; and contains one who has held a Scepter in her Hand, and a Crown on her Head. It might more properly have been ſaid exactly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, reply'd the Traveller, a Scepter in her Tail, and a Crown in her Hand: Yet 'tis not unlikely that there may be a Company of Strollers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and thoſe do frequently hold ſuch Scepters, and wear ſuch Crowns as thou prateſt of: For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly no Perſon worthy to ſway a Scepter, or wear a Crown, wou'd condeſcend to take up a Lodging in ſuch a paultry Inn as this, where I hear ſo little Noiſe. Thou haſt not been much converſant in the World (ſaid Don <hi>Quixote</hi>) ſince thou art ſo miſerably Ignorant of Accidents ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently met with in Knight-Errantry. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of him that held this tedious Diſcourſe with Don <hi>Quixote</hi> were tir'd with their fooliſh Prattle ſo long together, and therefore they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd with greater fury to the Gate, where they knock'd ſo violently and loud, that they wak'd both the Inn-keeper and his Gueſts; and ſo the Hoſt roſe to attend 'em.</p>

                              <pb n="546" facs="tcp:54446:300"/>In the mean time, <hi>Rozinante,</hi> penſive and ſad, with Ears hanging down, and motionleſs, bore up his out-ſtretch'd Lord; when one of the Horſes of thoſe Four that came thither laſt, walk'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Rozinante</hi> to ſmell him, and he truly being real Fleſh and Blood, tho' very like a Wooden Block, cou'd not chooſe but be ſenſible of it, nor forbear turning to ſmell the other, which ſo ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably came to comfort and divert him; but he had hardly ſtirr'd one inch from his place, when Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Feet that were cloſe together, ſlipt aſunder, and tumbling from the Saddle he had inevitably fallen to the Ground, had not his Wriſt been ſecurely faſten'd to the Rope; which put him to ſo great a Torture, that he cou'd not imagine but that his Hand was cutting off, or his Arm tearing from his Body; yet he hung ſo near the Ground, that he cou'd juſt reach it with the tips of his Toes, which added to his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for perceiving how little he wanted to the ſetting his Feet wholly on the Ground, he ſtrove and tugg'd as much as he cou'd to effect it; not much unlike thoſe that have the Strapado, who put themſelves to greater pain in ſtriving to ſtretch their Limbs, deluded by the hopes of touching the Ground, if they cou'd but inch themſelves out a little longer.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi> A Continuation of the ſtrange Adventures in the Inn.</head>
                           <p>THE miſerable Clamours of Don <hi>Quixote</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently drew the Inn-keeper to the Door, which he haſtily opening, was ſtrangely affrighted to hear ſuch lamentable ſhouts, and the Strangers ſtood no leſs ſurpriz'd. <hi>Maritornes,</hi> whom the Cries had alſo rouz'd, gueſſing the Cauſe, ran ſtraight to the Barn, and ſlipping the Halter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leas'd the Don, who made her a very proſtrate Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement by an unmerciful fall on the Ground. The Inn-keeper and Strangers crowded immediately round him to know the cauſe of his Misfortune. He, without regard to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, unmanacles his Wriſt, bounces from the Ground, Mounts <hi>Rozinante,</hi> braces his Target, couches his Lance; and taking a large Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the Field, came up with a hand-Gallop: Whoever, ſaid he, dare deny the late wonderful Poſture of my Affairs, the juſt Title of Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (by the gracious permiſſion of my Lady the Princeſs <hi>Micomicona</hi>) I affirm, he lies, and will maintain my Aſſertion by immediate Combat. The Travellers ſtood amaz'd at Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Words, till the Hoſt remov'd their Wonder by informing them of his uſual Extravagancies in this kind, and that his Behaviour was not to be minded. They then ask'd the Inn-keeper if a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Youth, near the Age of Fifteen, had ſet up at his Houſe, Mounted like a Muleteer; adding withal ſome farther Marks and Tokens denoting
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:54446:301"/>
Donna <hi>Clara</hi>'s Lover: He told them that among the number of his Gueſts, ſuch a Perſon might paſs him undiſtinguiſh'd; but one of them accidentally ſpying the Coach which the Judge rid in, call'd to his Companions, O! Gentlemen, Gentlemen, here ſtands the Coach which we were told my young Maſter follow'd, and here he muſt be, that's cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: Let's loſe no time, one Guard the Door, the reſt enter the Houſe to Ferret him—hold— ſtay—(continu'd he) ride one about to the other ſide o'th' Houſe, leſt he 'ſcape us through the back Yard; agreed ſays another; and they Poſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves accordingly. The Inn-keeper, though he might gueſs that they ſought the young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whom they had deſcrib'd, was nevertheleſs puzzl'd in the cauſe of their ſo diligent Search. By this time, fair Day-light and the Out-cries of Don <hi>Quixote</hi> had rais'd the whole Houſe; the two Ladies, <hi>Clara</hi> and <hi>Dorothea,</hi> having reſted ill, being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſturb'd, one through concern of being ſo near her Lover, and t'other by grief of being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanc'd from hers. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ſeeing the Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers neither regard him nor his Challenge, was ready to burſt with Fury and Indignation; and could he have diſpens'd with the Rules of Chival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which oblige a Knight-Errant to the finiſhing one Adventure before his Embarking in another, he had aſſaulted them all, and forc'd them to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him to their Coſt; but being unfortunately engag'd to re-inſtate the Princeſs <hi>Micomicona,</hi> his Hands were ty'd up, and he was compell'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, and expect where the Search and Diligence of the four Travellers would terminate: One of them found the young Gentleman faſt aſleep by a Foot-man, little dreaming of being follow'd or diſcover'd: The Fellow lugging him by the Arm, cries out, Ay, Ay, Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> theſe are very fine
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:54446:301"/>
Cloaths you have got on, and very becoming a Gentleman of your Quality indeed; this ſcurvy Bed too is very ſuitable to the care and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs your Mother brought you up with. The Youth having rubb'd his drowſie Eyes, and fixing them ſtedfaſtly on the Man, knew him preſently for one of his Father's Servants, which ſtruck him Speechleſs with Surprize. The Fellow went on; there is but one way, Sir, pluck up your Spirits, and return with us to your Father, who is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a dead Man unleſs you be recover'd. How came my Father to know, anſwer'd Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> that I took this Way and this Diſguiſe? One of your Fellow-Students, reply'd the Servant, whom you communicated your Deſign to, mov'd by your Father's Lamentation for your Loſs, diſcover'd it; the good old Gentleman diſpatch'd away four of his Men in ſearch of you; and here we are all at your Service, Sir, and the joyfulleſt Men alive, for our old Maſter will give us a hearty Welcome, having ſo ſoon reſtor'd him what he lov'd ſo much. That next to Heav'n, is as I pleaſe, ſaid Don <hi>Lewis.</hi> What would you or Heaven either, pleaſe, Sir, but return to your Father? Come, come, Sir, talk no more on't, home you muſt go, and home you ſhall go. The Foot-boy that lay with Don <hi>Lewis</hi> hearing this Diſpute roſe, and related the Buſineſs to Don <hi>Ferdinand, Cardenio,</hi> and the reſt that were now Dreſs'd, adding withal how the Man gave him the Title of Don, with other Circumſtances of their Conference. They being already Charm'd by the ſweetneſs of his Voice, were curious to be inform'd more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of his Circumſtances, reſolving to aſſiſt him, in caſe of any Violence offer'd, went preſently to the Place where he ſtood contending with the Servant.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="550" facs="tcp:54446:302"/>By this <hi>Dorothea</hi> had left her Chamber, and with her <hi>Donna Clara</hi> in great Diſorder. <hi>Dorothea</hi> beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Cardenio</hi> aſide, gave him a ſhort Account of the <hi>Muſician</hi> and <hi>Donna Clara;</hi> and he told her how the Servants that purfu'd him were arriv'd: <hi>Donna Clara</hi> over-hearing him, ſuffer'd ſuch Alterations, that had not <hi>Dorothea</hi> run and ſupported her, ſhe had ſunk to the Ground. <hi>Cardenio</hi> promiſing to bring the Matter to a fair and ſucceſsful End, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd <hi>Dorothea</hi> to retire with the indiſpos'd Lady to her Chamber. All the four that purſu'd Don <hi>Lewis</hi> were now come about him, preſſing his Return without Delay to comfort his poor Father; he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, 'Twas impoſſible, being engag'd to put a Buſineſs in Execution firſt, on which depended no leſs than his Honour, and his preſent and future Happineſs: They urg'd, that ſince they had found him, there was no returning for them without him, and if he would not go, he ſhould be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd; not, unleſs you kill me, anſwer'd the young Gentleman; upon which all the Company were join'd in the Diſpute, <hi>Cardenio,</hi> Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and his Companions, the Judge, the Curate, the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> who thought it needleſs now to Guard the Caſtle any longer. <hi>Cardenio,</hi> who knew the young Gentleman's Hiſtory, ask'd the Fellows upon what Pretence, or by what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority they could carry the Lad away againſt his Will: Sir, anſwer'd one of them, we have Reaſon good for what we do; no leſs than his Father's Life depends upon his Return. Gentlemen, ſaid Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> 'tis not proper perhaps to trouble you with a particular Relation of my Affairs; only thus much, I am a Gentleman, and have no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance that ſhould force me to any thing beſide my Inclination: Nay, but Sir, anſwer'd the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, Reaſon, I hope, will force you; and though
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:54446:302"/>
it cannot move you, it muſt govern us, who muſt execute our Orders, and force you back; we only act as we are order'd, Sir. Hold, ſaid the Judge, and let us know the whole ſtate of the Caſe. O Lord, Sir, anſwer'd one of the Servants that knew him, my Lord Judge, does not your Worſhip know your next Neighbour's Child? See here, Sir, he has run away from his Father's Houſe, and has put on theſe dirty tatter'd Rags to the Scandal of his Family, as your Worſhip may ſee. The Judge then viewing him more attentively knew him, and ſaluting him, What Jeſt is this, Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> cry'd he? What mighty Intrigue are you carrying on, young Sir, to occaſion this Metamorphoſis, ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming your Quality? The young Gentleman could not anſwer a Word, and the Tears ſtood in his Eyes; the Judge perceiving his Diſorder, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd the four Servants to trouble themſelves no farther, but leave the Youth to his Management, engaging his Word to act to their Satisfaction; and retiring with Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> he begg'd to know the Occaſion of his Flight.</p>
                           <p>During their Conference, they heard a great Noiſe at the Inn-Door, occaſion'd by two Strangers, who, having lodg'd there over Night, and ſeeing the whole Family ſo buſy'd in a curious Enquiry into the Four Horſemen's Buſineſs, thought to have made off without paying their Shot; but the Inn-keeper, who minded no Man's Buſineſs more than his own, ſtopp'd them in the Nick, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding his Money, upbraided their ungenteel Deſign very ſharply: They return'd the Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with Kick and Cuff ſo roundly, that the poor Hoſt cry'd out for Help; his Wife and Daughter ſaw none ſo idle as Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> whom the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter addreſſing, I conjure you, Sir Knight, ſaid ſhe, by that Virtue deliver'd to you from Heaven, to
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:54446:303"/>
ſuccour my diſtreſs'd Father, whom two Villains are beating to Jelly. Beautiful Damſel, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> with a ſlow Tone and profound Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, your Petition cannot at the preſent Juncture prevail, I being with-held from undertaking any new Adventure by an engaging Promiſe firſt to finiſh another; and all the Service you can expect, is only my Counſel in this important Affair; go with all ſpeed to your Father, with Advice to continue and maintain the Battel with his utmoſt Reſolution, till I obtain Permiſſion from the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Micomicona</hi> to reinforce him, which once grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you need make no doubt of his Safety. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Wretch that I am, ſaid <hi>Maritornes,</hi> who over-heard him; before you can have this Leave, my Maſter will be ſent to the other World. Then, Madam, ſaid he, procure me the Permiſſion I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, and tho' he were ſent into the other World, I'll bring him back in ſpight of Hell and the Devil, or at leaſt ſo revenge his Fall on his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, as ſhall give ample Satisfaction to his ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving Friends; whereupon breaking off the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, he went and threw himſelf proſtrate before <hi>Dorothea,</hi> imploring her, in Romantick Style, to grant him a Commiſſion to march and ſuſtain the Governour of that Caſtle, who was juſt fainting in a dangerous Engagement. The Princeſs diſpatch'd him very willingly; whereupon preſently buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on his Target, and taking up his Sword, he ran to the Inn-Door, where the two Gueſts ſtood hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their Landlord very unmercifully: He there made a ſudden Stop, tho' <hi>Maritornes</hi> and the Hoſteſs preſs'd him twice or thrice to tell the Cauſe of his Delay in his promis'd Aſſiſtance to his Hoſt. I make a Pauſe, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> becauſe I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Law of Arms to uſe my Sword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt none under the Order of Knighthood; but
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:54446:303"/>
let my Squire be call'd, this Affair is altogether his Province. In the mean time Drubs and Bruiſes were interchangeably given and taken, and the poor Hoſt ſoundly beaten. His Wife, Daughter and Maid, who ſtood by, were like to run mad at Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s hanging back, and the Inn-keeper's unequal Combat; where we ſhall leave him, with a Deſign to return to his Aſſiſtance preſently, tho' his Fool-hardineſs deſerves a ſound beating, for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting a thing he was not likely to compaſs. We now return to what Don <hi>Lewis</hi> anſwer'd the Judge, whom we left retir'd with him; and demanding the Reaſon of his Travelling on Foot, and in ſo mean a Diſguiſe. The young Gentleman preſſing his Hands very paſſionately, made this Reply, not without giving a Proof of the Greatneſs of his Sorrow by his Tears.</p>
                           <p>Without Ceremony or Preamble, I muſt tell you, dear Sir, that from the Inſtant that Heaven made us Neighbours, and I ſaw <hi>Donna Clara,</hi> your Daughter and my Miſtreſs, I reſign'd to her the whole Command of my Affections; and if you, whom I moſt truly call my Father don't prevent me, I ſhall this Day be happy in her Embraces; for her ſake have I abandon'd my Father's Houſe; for her have I thus diſguis'd my Quality; her would I thus have follow'd thro' the World: She was the North-Star to guide my wand'ring Courſe, and the Mark at which my Wiſhes flew. Her Ears indeed are utter Strangers to my Paſſion; but yet her Eyes may gueſs, by the Tears ſhe ſaw diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till'd from mine. You know my Fortune and my Quality, if theſe can plead Sir, I lay them at her Feet; then make me this Inſtant your happy Son; and if my Father, biaſs'd by contrary Deſigns, ſhould not approve my Choice, yet Time may work ſome favourable Change, and alter his Mind. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:54446:304"/>
Gentleman thus concluded. The Judge was much ſurpris'd at the handſome Diſcovery he made of his Affections, and was not a little puzzl'd how to behave himſelf in ſo ſudden and unexpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Matter; he therefore without any poſitive Anſwer, advis'd him only to compoſe his Thoughts, to divert himſelf with his Servants, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with them to allow him that Day to conſider on what was proper to be done. Don <hi>Lewis</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd his Gratitude by forcibly kiſſing the Judge's Hands, and bathing them in his Tears, enough to move the Heart of a Rock, much more a Judge's, who (being a Man o'th' World) had preſently the Advantage of the Match and Preferment of his Daughter in the Wind; tho' he much doubted the Conſent of Don <hi>Lewis</hi>'s Father, who he knew deſign'd to match his Son into the Nobility.</p>
                           <p>By this Time Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Entreaties more than Threats, had parted the Fray at the Inn Door; the Strangers paying their Reckoning went off, and Don <hi>Lewis</hi>'s Servants ſtood expecting the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of the Judge's Diſcourſe with their young Maſter: When (as the Devil would have it) who ſhould come into the Inn but the Barber whom Don <hi>Quixote</hi> had robb'd of <hi>Mambrino</hi>'s Helmet, and <hi>Sancho</hi> of the Pack-Saddle. As he was leading his Beaſt very gravely to the Stable, he ſpies <hi>Sancho</hi> mending ſomething about the Pannel; he knew him preſently, and ſetting upon him very roughly, Ah, Mr. Thief, Mr. Rogue, ſaid he, have I caught you at laſt, and all my Aſs's Furniture in your Hands too. <hi>Sancho</hi> finding himſelf ſo unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſaulted, and nettled at the diſhonourable Terms of his Language, laying faſt hold on the Pannel with one Hand, gave the Barber ſuch a Douſe on the Chops with t'other, as made his Mouth over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run with Blood; for all this the Barber ſtuck by
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:54446:304"/>
his Hold, and cry'd out ſo loud, that the whole Houſe was alarm'd at the Noiſe and Scuffle: I command you, Gentlemen, continu'd he, to aſſiſt me in the King's Name; for this Rogue has robb'd me on the King's High-way, and would now mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me becauſe I ſeize upon my Goods. That's a Lie, cry'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> 'twas no Robbery on the King's High-way; but lawful Plunder won by my Lord Don <hi>Quixote</hi> fairly in the Field. The Don him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was now come up, very proud of his Squire's Behaviour on this Occaſion, accounting him thenceforth a Man of Courage, and deſigning him the Honour of Knighthood on the firſt Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, thinking his Courage might prove a future Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament to the Order. Among other things which the Barber urg'd to prove his Claim, Gentlemen, ſaid he, this Pack-Saddle is as certainly my Pack-Saddle as I hope to die in my Bed; I know it as well as if it had been bred and born with me; nay, my very Aſs will witneſs for me; do but try the Saddle on him, and if it does not fit him as cloſe as cloſe can be, then call me a Liar—Nay, more than that, Gentlemen, that very Day when they robb'd me of my Pack-Saddle, they took away a ſpecial new Baſon which was never us'd, and which coſt me a Crown. Here Don <hi>Quixote</hi> could no longer contain himſelf; but, thruſting between them, he parted them; and having caus'd the Pack-Saddle to be depoſited on the Ground to open View, till the mighty Truth came to a final De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion; That this honourable Company may know, cry'd he, in what a manifeſt Errour this good Squire perſiſts, take notice how he degrades that with the Name of Baſon, which was, is, and ſhall be the Helmet of <hi>Mambrino,</hi> which I fairly won from him in the Field, and lawfully made my ſelf Lord of by Force of Arms. As to the Pack-Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:54446:305"/>
'tis a Concern that's beneath my Regard; all I have to urge in that Affair, is, That my Squire begg'd my Permiſſion to ſtrip that vanquiſh'd Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard's Horſe of his Trappings to adorn his own; he had my Authority for the Deed, and he took them: And now for his converting it from a Horſe's Furniture to a Pack-Saddle, no other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can be brought, but that ſuch Transformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons frequently occur in the Affairs of Chivalry. For a Confirmation of this, diſpatch, my <hi>Sancho,</hi> and produce the Helmet which this Squire would maintain to be a Baſon. O' my Faith, Sir, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> if this be all you can ſay for your ſelf, <hi>Mambrino</hi>'s Helmet will prove as arrant a Baſon, as this ſame Man's Furniture is a meer Pack-Saddle. Obey my Orders, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that every thing in this Caſtle will be guided by Inchantment. <hi>Sancho</hi> brought the Baſon, which Don <hi>Quixote</hi> holding up in his Hands, behold Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, continu'd he, with what Face can this impudent Squire affirm this to be a Baſon, and not the Helmet I mention'd: Now I ſwear before you all, by the Order of Knighthood, which I profeſs, That this is the ſame individual Helmet which I won from him, without the leaſt Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Diminution. That I'll ſwear, ſaid <hi>Sancho;</hi> for ſince my Lord won it, he never fought but once in it, and that was the Battel wherein he free'd thoſe ungracious Gally-Slaves, who by the ſame Token would have knock'd out his Brains with a Shower of Stones, had not this ſame honeſt Baſon-Helmet ſav'd his Skull.</p>

                           <p>PRAY good Gentlemen (ſaid the Barber) let's have your Opinion in this Matter, I ſuppoſe you will grant this ſame Helmet to be a Baſon. He that dares grant any ſuch thing (ſaid Don <hi>Quixote</hi>) muſt know that he lies plainly, if a Knight; but if a Squire, he lies abominably. Our Barber (who was privy to the whole Matter) to humour the Jeſt, and carry the Diverſion a little higher took up t'other Shaver. Mr. Barber, (you muſt pardon me, Sir, if I don't give you your Titles) I muſt let you underſtand (ſaid he) that I ſerv'd an Apprenticeſhip to your Trade, and have been a Free-man in the Company theſe thirty Years, and therefore am not to learn what belongs to Shaving. You muſt likewiſe know, that I have been a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier too in my younger Days, and conſequently underſtand the Differences between a Helmet, a Morion, and a Cloſe-Helmet, with all other Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutrements belonging to a Man of Arms. Yet I ſay (with Submiſſion ſtill to better Judgment) that this Piece, here in Diſpute before us, is as far from being a Baſon, as Light is from Darkneſs. Withal I affirm, on the other Hand, that altho' it be a Helmet, 'tis not a compleat one: Right, (ſaid
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:54446:306"/>
the Don) for the lower Part and the Beaver are wanting. A clear Caſe, a clear Caſe, ſaid the Curate, <hi>Cardenio,</hi> Don <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and his Companions, and the Judge himſelf (had not <hi>Lewis</hi>'s Concern made him thoughtful) would have humour'd the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Lord have Mercy upon us now, (ſaid the poor Barber half diſtracted) is it poſſible that ſo many ſine honourable Gentlemen ſhould know a Baſon or a Helmet no better than this comes to. Gadzookers, I defy the wiſeſt Univerſity in all <hi>Spain</hi> with their Scholarſhip, to ſhew me the like again. Well—if it muſt be a Helmet, it muſt be a Helmet, that's all. — And by the ſame Rule my Pack-Saddle muſt troop too; as this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman ſays. I muſt confeſs, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> as to outward Appearance it is a Pack-Saddle, but as I have already ſaid, I will not pretend to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Diſpute of this Point. Nay, ſaid the Curate, if Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ſpeak not, the Matter will never come to a Deciſion; becauſe in all Affairs of Chivalry we muſt all give him the Preference. I Swear, worthy Gentlemen, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> that the Adventures I have encounter'd in this Caſtle are ſo ſtrange and ſupernatural, that I muſt infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conclude them the Effects of pure Magick and Inchantment. The firſt Time I ever enter'd its Gates I was ſtrangely embarraſs'd by an inchanted <hi>Moor</hi> that Inhabited it, and <hi>Sancho</hi> himſelf had no better Entertainment from his Attendants; and laſt Night I hung ſuſpended almoſt two Hours by this Arm, without the Power of helping my ſelf, or of aſſigning any reaſonable Cauſe of my Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune. So that for me to meddle or give my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion in ſo confus'd and intricate Events, would appear Preſumption; I have already giv'n my final Determination as to the Helmet-Controverſy, but dare pronounce no definitive Sentence on the Pack-Saddle,
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:54446:306"/>
but ſhall remit it to the diſcerning Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Company; perhaps the Power of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment may not prevail on you that are not dubb'd Knights, ſo that your Underſtandings may be free, and your judicial Faculties more piercing to enter into the true Nature of theſe Events, and not conclude upon them from their Appearances. Undoubtedly, anſwer'd Don <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> the Deciſion of this Proceſs depends upon our Sentiments, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Don <hi>Quixote's</hi> Opinion; that the Matter therefore may be fairly diſcuſs'd, and that we may proceed upon ſolid and firm Grounds, we'll put it to the Vote. Let every one give me his Suffrage in my Ear, and I will oblige my ſelf to report them faithfully to the Board.</p>
                           <p>To thoſe that knew Don <hi>Quixote</hi> this prov'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Sport; but to others unacquainted with his Humour, as Don <hi>Lewis</hi> and his four Servants, it appear'd the moſt ridiculous Stuff in Nature; three Travellers too that happen'd to call in by the Way, and were found to be <hi>Officers of the Holy Brotherhood,</hi> or <hi>Purſivants,</hi> thought the People were all bewitch'd in good Earneſt. Every Body laugh'd very heartily to ſee Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> whiſpering each particular Perſon very gravely to have his Vote upon the important Contention of the Pack-Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. When he had gone the Rounds among his own Faction, that were all privy to the Jeſt; Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Fellow, ſaid he very loudly, I grow weary of asking ſo many impertinent Queſtions; every Man has his Anſwer at his Tongue's End, that 'tis meer Madneſs to call this a Pack-Saddle, and that 'tis poſitively, <hi>nemine contradicente,</hi> right Horſe-Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and great Horſe-Furniture too; beſides, Friend, your Allegations and Proofs are of no Force, therefore in ſpight of your Aſs and you, we will give it for the Defendant, that this is, and will
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:54446:307"/>
continue the Furniture of a Horſe, nay, and of a great Horſe too. Now the Devil take me, ſaid the Barber, if you be not all damnably deceiv'd; and may I be hang'd if my Conſcience does not plainly tell me 'tis a down-right Pack-Saddle: but I have loſt it according to Law, and ſo fare it well. — But I am neither mad nor drunk ſure, for I am freſh and faſting this Morning from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing but Sin.</p>
                           <p>The Barber's Raving was no leſs diverting than Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Clamours; Sentence is paſs'd, cry'd he, and let every Man take Livery of his Goods and Chattels, and Heav'n give him Joy. This is a Jeſt, a meer Jeſt, ſaid one of the four Servants; certainly, Gentlemen, you can't be in Earneſt, you're too wiſe to talk at this Rate: For my Part, I ſay, and will maintain it, for there's no Reaſon the Barber ſhould be wrong'd, that this is a Baſon, and that the Pack-Saddle of a He-Aſs. Mayn't it be a She-Aſs's Pack-Saddle, Friend, ſaid the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate? That's all one, Sir, ſaid the Fellow; the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is not whether it be a He or a She-Aſs's Pack-Saddle, but whether it be a Pack-Saddle or not, that's the Matter, Sir. One of the Officers of the <hi>Holy Brotherhood,</hi> who had heard the whole Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, very angry to hear ſuch an Error main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd: Gentlemen, ſaid he, this is no more a Horſe's Saddle than 'tis my Father, and he that ſays the contrary is drunk or mad. You lie like an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly Raſcal, ſaid the Knight; and at the ſame Time with his Lance, which he had always ready for ſuch Occaſions, he diſcharg'd ſuch a Blow on the Officer's Head, that had not the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low leap'd aſide it would have laid him flat. The Lance by the Force of the Stroak flew to Pieces, and the reſt of the Officers ſeeing their Comrade ſo abus'd cry'd out for Help, charging every one to
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:54446:307"/>
aid and aſſiſt the <hi>Holy Brotherhood.</hi> The Inn-keeper, being one of the Fraternity, ran for his Sword and Staff, and then joyn'd his Fellows. Don <hi>Lewis</hi>'s Servants got round their Maſter to defend him from Harm, and ſecure him leſt he ſhould make his Eſcape in the Scuffle. The Barber ſeeing the whole Houſe turn'd topſy turvy, laid Hold again on his Pack-Saddle; but <hi>Sancho</hi> who watch'd his Motions was as ready as he, and ſecur'd t'other End of it.</p>
                           <p>Don <hi>Quixote</hi> drew, and aſſaulted the Officers Pell-mell, Don <hi>Lewis</hi> call'd to his Servants to join Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and the Gentlemen that ſided with him; for <hi>Cardenio,</hi> Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and his Friends had engag'd on his Side. The Curate cry'd out, the Landlady ſhriek'd, her Daughter wept, <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tornes</hi> howl'd, <hi>Dorothea</hi> was diſtracted with Fear, <hi>Lucinda</hi> could not tell what to do, and Donna <hi>Clara</hi> was ſtrangely frighted; the Barber pummell'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> belabour'd the Barber. One of Don <hi>Lewis</hi>'s Servants went to hold him, but he gave him ſuch a Rebuke on his Jaws, that his Teeth had like to have forſook their Station; and then the Judge took him into his Protection. Don <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> had got one of the Officers down, and laid him on Back and Side. The Inn-keeper ſtill cry'd our, Help the <hi>Holy Brotherhood;</hi> ſo that the whole Houſe was a Medley of Wailings, Cries, Shrieks, Confuſions, Fears, Terrors, Diſaſters, Slaſhes, Buffets, Blows, Kicks, Cuffs, Battery, and Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>
                           <p>In the greateſt Heat of this Hurly-burly it came into Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Head, that he was certainly involv'd in the Diſorder and Confuſion of King <hi>Agramant</hi>'s Camp; and calling out, with a Voice that ſhook the whole Houſe, Hold valorous Knights, ſaid he, all hold your furious Hands,
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:54446:308"/>
ſheath all your Swords, let none preſume to ſtribe on Pain of Death, but hear me ſpeak. The loud and monſtrous Voice ſurpriz'd every Body into O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and the Don proceeded: I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Gentlemen, that this Caſtle was inchanted, and that ſome Legion of Devils did inhabit it; now let your own Eyes confirm my Words: Don't you behold the ſtrange and horrid Confuſion of King <hi>Agramant</hi>'s Army remov'd hither, and put in Execution among us? See, ſee how there they fight for the Sword, and yonder for the Horſe; behold how ſome contend for the Helmet, and here others battel it for the Standard; and all fight we don't know how, nor can tell why. Let there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Lord Judge, and his Reverence Mr. Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate repreſent, one, King <hi>Agramant,</hi> and the other, King <hi>Sobrino;</hi> and by their Wiſdom and Conduct, appeaſe this Tumult; for, by the Powers Divine, 'twere a wrong to Honour, and a blot on Chivalry, to let ſo many Worthies, as here engage, fall on ſo ſlight a Cauſe.</p>
                           <p>Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s words were Hebrew to the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, who having been roughly handl'd by <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denio, Ferdinand,</hi> and his Friends, would not give it over ſo. But the Barber was content, for <hi>Sancho</hi> had demoliſh'd his Beard and Pack-ſaddle both in the Scuffle: The Squire dutifully retreated at the firſt ſound of his Maſter's Voice; Don <hi>Lewis</hi>'s Servants were calm, finding it their beſt way to be quiet; but the Inn-keeper was refractory. He ſwore that Mad-man ought to be puniſh'd for his ill-behaviour, and that every Hour he was making ſome Diſturbance or another in his Houſe. But at laſt, the Matter was made up, the Pack-ſaddle was agreed to be Horſe-Furniture, the Baſon a Helmet, and the Inn a Caſtle, till the Day of Judgment, if Don <hi>Quixote</hi> would have it ſo. Don
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:54446:308"/>
                              <hi>Lewis</hi>'s Buſineſs came next in play. The Judge, in concert with Don <hi>Ferdinand, Cardenio,</hi> and the Curate, reſolv'd, That Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe his Authority on Don <hi>Lewis</hi>'s behalf, and let his Servants know, That he would carry him to <hi>Andaluſia,</hi> where he ſhould be entertain'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Quality by his Brother the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, and they ſhould not oppoſe this Deſign, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Don <hi>Lewis</hi> was poſitively reſolv'd not to be forc'd to go back to his Father yet. Don <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi>'s Quality, and Don <hi>Lewis</hi>'s Reſolution pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd on the Fellows to order Matters ſo, that three of them might return, to acquaint their old Maſter, and the fourth wait on Don <hi>Lewis.</hi> Thus this monſtrous heap of Confuſion and Diſorder was digeſted into Form by the Authority of <hi>Agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant,</hi> and Wiſdom of King <hi>Sobrino.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But the Enemy of Peace, finding his Project of ſetting them all by the Ears ſo elluded, reſolv'd once again to have another Trial of Skill, and play the Devil with them all the ſecond bout: For though the Officers underſtanding the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Adverſaries were willing to deſiſt, yet one of them, whom Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had kick'd moſt unmercifully, remembring that among other Warrants, he had one to apprehend Don <hi>Quixote</hi> for ſetting free the Galley-Slaves (which <hi>Sancho</hi> was ſadly afraid would come about,) he reſolv'd to examine if the Marks and Tokens given of Don <hi>Quixote</hi> agreed with this Perſon; then draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out a Parchment, and opening his Warrant, he made a ſhift to read it, at every other word looking cunningly on Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Face; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, having folded up the Parchment, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Warrant in the Left-hand, he clap'd his Right hand faſt in the Knight's Collar, crying you're the King's Priſoner: Gentlemen, I am an
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:54446:309"/>
Officer, here's my Warrant. I charge you all to aid and aſſiſt the <hi>Holy Brother-hood.</hi> Don <hi>Quixote</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf us'd ſo rudely by one whom he took to be a pitiful Scoundrel, kindl'd up into ſuch a Rage, that he ſhook with Indignation; and catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fellow by the Neck, with both his Hands, throttl'd him ſo eagerly, that if his Companions had not preſently freed him, the Knight would have ſqueez'd out his Life before he had quitted his hold.</p>
                           <p>The Inn-keeper being oblig'd to aſſiſt his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Officer, preſently joyn'd him: The Hoſteſs ſeeing her Husband engaging a ſecond time, rais'd a new Out-cry, her Daughter and <hi>Maritornes</hi> bore the burden of the Song, ſometimes praying, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times crying, ſometimes ſcolding: <hi>Sancho</hi> ſeeing what paſs'd, By the Lord, ſaid he, my Maſter is in the right; this Place is Haunted, that's certain; there's no living quietly an Hour together. At laſt Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> parted Don <hi>Quixote</hi> and the Officer, who were both pretty well pleas'd to quit their Bargain. However, the Officers ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded their Priſoner, and to have him deliver'd bound into their Hands, commanding all the Company a ſecond Time to help and aſſiſt them, in ſecuring that publick Robber upon the King's high Road.</p>
                           <p>Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ſmil'd at the ſuppos'd Simplicity of the Fellows; at laſt with ſolemn Gravity, Come hither, ſaid he, you Off-ſpring of Filth, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of Dunghills, dare you call looſing the Fetter'd, freeing the Captiv'd, helping the Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, raiſing the Fall'n, and ſupplying the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent dare you, I ſay, baſe-ſpirited Raſcals, call theſe Actions Robbery? Your Thoughts indeed are too grovelling and ſervile to underſtand, or reach the Pitch of Chivalry, otherwiſe you had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:54446:309"/>
that even the Shadow of a Knight-Errant had Claim to your Adoration. You a Band of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; you're a Pack of Rogues indeed, and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers on the High-way by Authority. What Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of a Magiſtrate durſt iſſue out a Warrant to Apprehend a Knight-Errant like me? Could not his Ignorance find out that we are exempt from all Courts of Judicature? That our Valour is the Bench, our Will the Common-Law, and our Sword the Executioner of Juſtice. Could not his Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs inform him that no Rank of Nobility or Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage enjoys more Immunities and Privileges? Has he any Preſident that a Knight-Errant ever paid Taxes, Subſidy, Poll-Money, or ſo much as Fare or Ferry? What Taylor ever had Money for his Cloaths, or what Conſtable ever made him pay a Reckoning for his Lodging in his Caſtle? What Kings are not proud of his Company, and what Damſels of his Love? And laſtly, did you ever read of any Knight-Errant that ever was, is, or ſhall be, that could not with his ſingle Force Cudgel four hundred ſuch Rogues as you to pieces, if they have the Impudence to Oppoſe him?</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> The notable Adventure of the Officers of the Holy Brotherhood, with Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s great Ferocity and Inchantment.</head>
                           <p>WHilſt Don <hi>Quixote</hi> talk'd at this rate, the Curate endeavour'd to perſwade the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers that he was diſtracted, as they might eaſily
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:54446:310"/>
gather from his Words and Actions, and therefore though they ſhould carry him before a Magiſtrate, he would be preſently acquitted, as being a Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: He that had the Warrant made Anſwer, That 'twas not his Buſineſs to examine whether he were mad or not; he was an Officer in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and muſt obey Orders; but if the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Power would acquit him, with all his Heart. But for all that the Curate perſiſted, aſſuring them, that they ſhould not be ſuffer'd to carry Don <hi>Quixote</hi> away this Time; and in ſhort, ſaid ſo much, and the Knight did ſo much; that they had been greater Fools than he, could they not have plainly ſeen his Madneſs. They therefore not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſiſted, but offer'd their Service in compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Difference between <hi>Sancho</hi> and the Barber; their Mediation was accepted, they being Officers of Juſtice, and ſucceeded ſo well, that both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſtood to their Arbitration, though not entirely ſatisfied with their Award, which order'd them to change their Pannels, but not their Halters, nor the Girths. The Curate made up the Buſineſs of the Baſon, paying the Barber under-hand eight Reals for his Intereſt, and getting a general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe under his Hand of all Claims or Actions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it. Theſe two important Differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo happily decided, the only Obſtacle to a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Peace were Don <hi>Lewis</hi>'s Servants, and the Inn-keeper; the firſt were at laſt prevail'd upon to accept the Propoſals offer'd, which were, that three of them ſhould go home, and the fourth at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> where Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point. Thus this Difference was alſo made up, to the unſpeakable Joy of <hi>Donna Clara.</hi> The Inn-keeper made a hideous Bawling; having diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd that the Barber had receiv'd Money for his Baſon; he knew no Reaſon, he ſaid, why he
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:54446:310"/>
ſhould not be paid as well as other Folks, and ſwore that <hi>Rozinante</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Aſs, ſhould pay for their Maſter's Extravagance before they ſhould leave his Stable: The Curate pacify'd him, and Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> paid him his Bill. <hi>Zoraida</hi> not well underſtanding how Matters paſs'd, was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably merry or ſad, according to the Shew made by the reſt, but the Motions of her <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> (on whom her Eyes were always fix'd) chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly influenc'd her Affections. All things thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated, the Inn no longer reſembled the Confuſion of <hi>Agramant</hi>'s Camp; but appear'd huſh'd in the general Calm of Peace; upon which the Curate and Don <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> by univerſal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, had the Thanks of the Houſe; as a juſt Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment for their ſo effectual Mediation.</p>
                           <p>Don <hi>Quixote</hi> being now free from the Difficulties and Delays that lately embarraſs'd him, held it high time to proſecute his Voyage, and bring to ſome Deciſion the general Enterprize which he had the Voice and Election for. He therefore ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolv'd to preſs his Departure, and fell on his Knees before <hi>Dorothea,</hi> but ſhe would not hear him in that Poſture, but prevail'd upon him to riſe: He then addreſſing her in his uſual Forms; Moſt beautiful Lady, ſaid he, 'tis a known Proverb, <hi>That Diligence is the Mother of Succeſs;</hi> and we have found the greateſt Succeſſes in War ſtill to depend on Expedition and Diſpatch, by preventing the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's Deſign, and forcing a Victory before an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault is expected. My Inference from this, moſt high and illuſtrious Lady, is, that our Reſidence in this Caſtle appears nothing conducive to our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, but may prove dangerous; for we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably ſuppoſe that our Enemy the Gyant may learn by Spies or ſome other ſecret Intelligence, the Scheme of our Intentions, and conſequntly
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:54446:311"/>
fortify himſelf in ſome inexpugnable Fortreſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Power of our moſt prevailing Force, where the Strength of my invincible Arm may be uneffectual. Let us therefore, dear Madam, by our Diligence and ſudden Departure hence, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any ſuch his Deſigns, and force our good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, by miſſing no Opportunity that we may lay hold of. Here he ſtopt waiting the Princeſs's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. She with a grave Aſpect, and Stile ſuiting his Extravagance, reply'd, The great Inclination and indefatigable Deſire you ſhew, worthy Knight, in redreſſing the injur'd and reſtoring the oppreſs'd, lay a fair Claim to the Praiſes and univerſal Thanks of Mankind; but your ſingular Concern, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious Application in aſſiſting me, deſerve my particular Acknowledgments and Gratification; and I ſhall make it my peculiar Requeſt to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that your generous Deſigns, in my favour, may be ſoon accompliſh'd, that I may be enabl'd to convince you of the Honour and Gratitude that may be found in ſome of our Sex. As to our Departure, I ſhall depend upon your Pleaſure, to whoſe Management I have not only committed the Care of my Perſon, but alſo reſign'd the whole Power of Command. Then, by the Aſſiſtance of the Divine Power, anſwer'd he, I will loſe no Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of exalting your Highneſs, which you thus condeſcend to humble to my Orders; let our March be ſudden, for the Eagerneſs of my Deſires, the Length of the Journey, and the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of Delay, are great Spurs to my Diſpatch; depending therefore on the Vigour of my Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, which neither Danger nor Hell can daunt, fly, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaddle <hi>Rozinante,</hi> harneſs your Aſs, and make ready the Lady's Palfrey; let us take leave of the Governour here, and theſe other Lords, and ſet out from hence immediately.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="569" facs="tcp:54446:311"/>Poor <hi>Sancho</hi> hearing all that paſs'd, ſhook his Head. Lord, Lord, Maſter, ſaid he, there's al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways more Tricks in a Town than are talk'd of (with Reverence be it ſpoken.) Ho! Villain, cry'd Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> What Tricks can any Town or City ſhew to impair my Credit? Nay, Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> if you grow Angry, I can hold my Tongue, if that be all; but there are ſome things which you ought to hear, and I ſhould tell as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a truſty Squire and honeſt Servant. Say what thou wilt, ſaid the Knight, ſo it tend not to Cowardiſe; for if thou art afraid, keep it to thy ſelf, and trouble not me with the mention of Fear which my Soul abhors. Pſhaw, hang Fear, Sir, anſwer'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> that's not the Matter; but I muſt tell you, Sir, that which is as certain and plain as the Noſe on your Face. This ſame Madam here that calls her ſelf the Queen of the great Kingdom of <hi>Micomicon,</hi> is no more a Queen than my Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame. For, do but conſider, Sir, if ſhe were ſuch a fine Queen, as you believe, can you imagine ſhe wou'd always be kiſſing and ſlabbering a certain Perſon that ſhall be nameleſs in this Company? <hi>Dorothea</hi> bluſh'd at <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Words, for Don <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> had indeed, ſometimes and in private, taken the Freedom with his Lips, to reap ſome part of the Reward his Affection deſerv'd; which <hi>Sancho</hi> ſpying by chance, made ſome Conſtructions upon it, very much to the Diſadvantage of her Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for in ſhort he concluded her no better than a Woman of Pleaſure: She nevertheleſs wou'd take no Notice of his Aſperſion, but let him go on. I ſay this, Sir, continu'd he, becauſe after our trudging thro' all Weathers, fair after foul, Day after Night, and Night after Day, this ſame Perſon in the Inn here, is like to divert himſelf at our Expence, and to gather the Fruit of our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours?
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:54446:312"/>
I think therefore, Maſter, there is no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, d'ye ſee, for Saddling <hi>Rozinante,</hi> Harneſſing my Aſs, or making ready the Lady's Palfrey; for we had better ſtay where we are; and let every Whore Brew as ſhe Bakes, and every Man that is Hungry go to Dinner?</p>
                           <p>Heavens! Into what a Fury did theſe diſreſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Words of <hi>Sancho</hi> put the Knight? his whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhook, his Tongue faultr'd, his Eyes glow'd. Thou Villanous, Ignorant, Raſh, Unmannerly Blaſphemous Detractor, ſaid he, how dar'ſt thou entertain ſuch Baſe and Diſhonourable Thoughts, much more utter thy Rude and Contemptible Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions before me and this Honourable Preſence? away from my Sight, thou Monſter of Nature, Magazine of Lies and Deceits, Publiſher of Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, Foe of all Honour! Away, and never let me ſee thy Face again, on Pain of my moſt furious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation. Then bending his ſowr Brows, puſſing his Cheeks, and ſtamping on the Ground, he gave <hi>Sancho</hi> ſuch a Look as almoſt frighted the poor Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to Annihilation.</p>

                           <p>Be not impatient, O Knight of the Woeful Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, at your Impriſonment, ſince 'tis ordain'd by the Fates, for the more ſpeedy Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that moſt noble Adventure, which your incomparable Valour has intended. For accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd it ſhall be, when the rampant <hi>Manchegan</hi> Lyon, and the white <hi>Toboſian</hi> Dove ſhall be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by humbling their lofty and erected Creſts to the ſoft Yoke of Wedlock, from whoſe wonderful Coition ſhall ſpring, to light the World, fierce Whelps which ſhall imitate the ravaging Paws of their valorous Sire. And this ſhall happen before the bright Purſuer of the fugitive Nymph ſhall by his rapid and natural Courſe take a double Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference in Viſitation of the Luminous Signs. And thou, the moſt noble and faithful Squire that ever had Sword on Thigh, Beard on Face, or Senſe of Smell in Noſe, be not diſpirited or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented at this Captivity of the Flower of all Chivalry; for very ſpeedily, by the eternal Will of the World's Creator, thou ſhalt find thy ſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobl'd and exalted beyond the Knowledge of thy Greatneſs. And I confirm to thee, from the Sage <hi>Mentironiana,</hi> that thou ſhalt not be defrauded of the Promiſes made by thy noble Lord. I therefore conjure thee to follow cloſely the Steps of the couragious and inchanted Knight; for it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily enjoin'd that you both go where you both ſhall ſtay. The Fates have commanded me no more, farewel. For I now return, I well know whither.</p>
                           <p>The Barber manag'd the Cadence of his Voice ſo artificially towards the latter end of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:54446:315"/>
that even thoſe who were made acquainted with the Jeſt, had almoſt taken it for Supernatural.</p>
                           <p>Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was much comforted at the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, apprehending preſently the Senſe of it, and applying it to his Marriage with <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo,</hi> from whoſe happy Womb ſhould iſſue the Cubbs, (ſignifying his Sons) to the eternal Glory of <hi>La Mancha;</hi> upon the Strength of which Belief raiſing his Voice, and heaving a profound Sigh. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thou art, ſaid he, whoſe happy Prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation I own and acknowledge, I deſire thee to implore (in my Name) the wiſe Magician, whoſe Charge I am, that his Power may protect me in this Captivity, and not permit me to periſh before the Fruition of theſe grateful and incomparable Promiſes made to me; for the Confirmation of ſuch Hopes, I wou'd think my Priſon a Palace, my Fetters Freedom, and this hard Field-Bed on which I lie, more eaſy than the ſofteſt Down, or moſt luxurious Lodgings. And as to the Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation offer'd my Squire <hi>Sancho Pança,</hi> I am ſo convinc'd of his Honeſty, and he has prov'd his Honour in ſo many Adventures, that I miſtruſt not his deſerting me through any Change of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. And tho' his or my harder Stars ſhou'd diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able me from beſtowing on him the Iſland I have promis'd, or ſome Equivalent; his Wages at leaſt are ſecur'd to him by my laſt Will and Teſtament, tho' what he will receive, is more anſwerable, I confeſs to my Eſtate and Ability, than to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and great Deſerts. <hi>Sancho Pança</hi> made him three or four very reſpectful Bowes, and kiſs'd both his Hands; (for one alone he cou'd not, being both ty'd together) and in an Inſtant the Daemons hoiſted up the Cage, and yoak'd it very handſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Team of Oxen.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. XX.</hi> Proſecuting the Courſe of Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment, with other Memorable Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</head>
                           <p>DON <hi>Quixote</hi> was not ſo much amaz'd at his Inchantment, as the Manner of it: Among all the Volumes of Chivalry that I have turn'd over, ſaid he, I never read before of Knight-Errants drawn in Carts, or tugg'd along ſo leaſurely by ſuch ſloathful Animals as Oxen. For they us'd to be hurry'd along with prodigious ſpeed, invelop'd in ſome dark and dusky Cloud; or in ſome Fiery Chariot drawn by Wing'd Griffins, or ſome ſuch expeditious Creatures; tho' perhaps the Inchantments of our Times, take a different Method from thoſe in former Ages. Or rather the Wiſe Magicians have invented ſome new Courſe in their Proceedings for me, being the firſt reviver and reſtorer of Arms, which have ſo long been loſt in Oblivion, and ruſted thro' the diſuſe of Chivalry. What is thy Opinion, my dear <hi>Sancho?</hi> Why truly, Sir, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> I can't tell what to think, being not ſo well read in theſe Matters as your Worſhip, yet for all that I'm poſitive and can take my Oath on't, that theſe ſame Viſions that run up and down here are not Orthodox. Orthodox, my Friend, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> how can they be Orthodox, when they are Devils, and have only aſſum'd theſe Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:54446:316"/>
Bodies to ſurpriſe us into this Condition? To convince you, endeavour to touch them, and you will find, their Subſtances are not material, but only ſubtle Air, and outward Appearance. Gadzookers, Sir, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> I have touch'd them, and touch'd them again, Sir; and I find this ſame buſie Devil here, that's fidling about, is as plump and fat as a Capon: Beſides, he has another pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, very different from a Devil; for the Devils, they ſay, ſmell of Brimſtone and other filthy Things, and this Spark has ſuch a fine ſcent of Eſſence about him, that you may feel him at leaſt half a League. (Meaning Don <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who in all probability, like other Gentlemen of his Quality, had his Cloathes Perfum'd.)</p>
                           <p>Alas, honeſt <hi>Sancho,</hi> anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> the Cunning of theſe Fiends is above the reach of thy Simplicity; for you muſt know, that Spirits, as Spirits, have no Scent at all; and if they ſhou'd, it muſt neceſſarily be ſome Unſavory Stench, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſtill carry their Hell about them, and the leaſt of a Perfume or grateful Odour were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with their Torments; ſo that this Miſtake of yours muſt be attributed to ſome farther Deluſion of your Senſe. Don <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and <hi>Cardenio,</hi> upon theſe Diſcourſes between Maſter and Man, were affraid that <hi>Sancho</hi> wou'd ſpoil all, and therefore order'd the Inn-keeper privately to get ready <hi>Rozinante</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Aſs; while the Curate agreed with the Officers for ſo much a Day to Conduct them home. <hi>Cardenio</hi> having hung Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Target on the Pummel of <hi>Rozinante</hi>'s Saddle, and the Baſon on t'other ſide, he ſignify'd to <hi>Sancho</hi> by Signs that he ſhou'd mount his Aſs, and lead <hi>Rozinante</hi> by the Bridle, and laſtly plac'd two Officers with their Fire-Locks on each ſide of the Cart.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="577" facs="tcp:54446:316"/>Being juſt ready to March, the Hoſteſs, her Daughter, and <hi>Maritornes,</hi> came to the Door to take their leave of the Knight, pretending unſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Grief for his Misfortune. Reſtrain your Tears, moſt Honourable Ladies, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> for theſe Miſchances are incident to thoſe of my Profeſſion; and from theſe Misfortunes it is, we Date the greatneſs of our Glory and Renown; they are the Effects of Envy, which ſtill attend Vertuous and great Actions, and brought upon us by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct means of ſuch Princes and Knights as are emulous of our Dignity and Fame; but ſpight of all Oppreſſion, ſpight of all the Magick that ever its firſt Inventor <hi>Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>roaſter</hi> underſtood, Virtue will come off victorious; and triumphing over every Danger, will at laſt ſhine out in its proper Luſtre like the Sun to inlighten the World. Pardon me, fair Ladies, if (thro' Ignorance or Omiſſion of the Reſpects due to your Qualities) I have not behav'd my ſelf to pleaſe you; for to the beſt of my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge I never committed a wilful Wrong. And I crave the aſſiſtance of your Prayers towards my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement from this Priſon, which ſome malicious Magician has confin'd me to; and the firſt Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my Freedom, ſhall be a grateful Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment for the many and obliging Favours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd upon me in this your Caſtle. Whilſt the Ladies were thus entertain'd by Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> the Curate and Barber, were buſie taking their leaves of their Company, and after mutual Complements and Embraces they engag'd to acquaint one another with their ſucceeding Fortunes. Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated the Curate to give him a particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Adventures, aſſuring him, That nothing wou'd be a greater Obligation; and in Return, he engag'd to inform him of all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences in his own and <hi>Lucinda</hi>'s Return; with
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:54446:317"/>
an Account of <hi>Zoraida</hi>'s Baptiſm, and Don <hi>Lewis</hi>'s Succeſs in his Amour.</p>
                           <p>The Curate having given his Word and Honour to ſatisfie Don <hi>Ferdinand;</hi> And the laſt Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being paſt, was juſt going, when the Inn-keeper made him a proffer of a bundle of Papers found in the folds of the ſame Cloak-Bag, where he got the Curious Impertinent, telling him withal, That they were all at his Service; becauſe ſince the Owner was not like to come and demand them, and he cou'd not Read, they cou'd not better be diſpos'd of. The Curate thank'd him heartily, and opening the Papers found them Entitl'd, <hi>The Story of</hi> Rinconete, <hi>and</hi> Cortadillo; the Title ſhewing it to be a Novel, and probably written by the Author of the Curious Impertinent, becauſe found in the ſame Wallet, he put it in his Pocket, with a Reſolution to peruſe it the very firſt Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity: Then mounting with his Friend the Barber, and both putting on their Masks, they follow'd the Proceſſion, which march'd in this Order. The Carter led the Van, and next his Cart, ſlank'd on right and left with two Officers and their Fire-Locks, then follow'd <hi>Sancho</hi> on his Aſs, leading <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and laſtly the Curate and Barber on their mighty Mules brought up the Rear of the Body, all with a grave and profound Air, marching no faſter than their heavy Oxen allow'd. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ſat leaning againſt the back of the Cage with his Hands ty'd, and his Legs at length; but ſo ſilent and motionleſs, that he ſeem'd rather a Statue than a Man.</p>
                           <p>They had Travell'd about two Leagues this ſlow and leiſurely pace, when their Conductor ſtopping in a little Valley, propos'd it as a ſit Place to Bait in; but he was prevail'd upon to defer halting a little longer, being inform'd by the Barber of a
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:54446:317"/>
certain Valley beyond a little Hill in their View, better ſtor'd with Graſs, and more convenient for their purpoſe: They had not Travell'd much farther, when the Curate ſpy'd coming a round Pace after them ſix or ſeven Men very well moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; they appear'd by their haſte to endeavour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Heat of the Day to reach their Inn, which was about a League farther. In ſhort, they ſoon came up with our ſlow Itinerants; and one of them that was Canon of <hi>Toledo,</hi> and Maſter of thoſe that came along with him, marking the formal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Cart, Guards, <hi>Sancho, Rozinante,</hi> the Curate, and the Barber; but chiefly the incag'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> cou'd not forbear asking what meant their ſtrange Method of ſecuring that Man; tho' he already believ'd (having obſerv'd the Guards) that he was ſome notorious Criminal in cuſtody of the Holy Brotherhood. One of the Fraternity told him, That he cou'd not tell the Cauſe of that Knight's Impriſonment, but that he might anſwer for himſelf, becauſe he beſt cou'd tell.</p>
                           <p>Don <hi>Quixote</hi> over-hearing their Diſcourſe, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, ſaid he, if you are converſant and skill'd in Matters of Knight-Errantry, I will communicate my Misfortunes to you; if you are not, I have no reaſon to give myſelf the trouble. Truly Friend, anſwer'd the Canon, I am better acquainted with Books of Chivalry than with <hi>Villalpando</hi>'s <hi>Summu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae;</hi> and if that be all your Objection, you may ſafely impart to me what you pleaſe. With Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven's permiſſion be it ſo, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> you muſt then underſtand, Sir Knight, that I am born away in this Cage by the force of Inchantments thro' the envious Spight and Malice of ſome curſed Magicians; for Virtue is more zealouſly perſecuted by ill Men, than 'tis belov'd by the Good. I am, by Profeſſion, a Knight-Errant, and none of thoſe,
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:54446:318"/>
I aſſure you, whoſe Deeds never merited a place in the Records of Fame; but one who in ſpight of Envy's ſelf, in ſpight of all the Magi of <hi>Perſia,</hi> the Brachmans of <hi>India,</hi> or the Gymnoſophiſts of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> ſhall ſecure to his Name a place in the Temple of Immortality, as a Pattern and Model to following Ages; that enſuing Knight-Errants following my Steps, may be guided to the top and higheſt pitch of Heroic Honour: The noble Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha</hi> ſpeaks truth, ſaid the Curate coming up to the Company, he is indeed inchanted in this Cart, not thro' his own Demerits or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, but the malicious Treachery of thoſe whom Vertue diſpleaſes and Valour offends. This is, Sir, the Knight of the woful Figure, of whom you have undoubtedly heard, whoſe mighty Deeds ſhall ſtand engrav'd in laſting Braſs and time-ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving Marble, till Envy grows tir'd with La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to deface his Fame, and Malice to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal 'em.</p>
                           <p>The Canon hearing the Priſoner and his Guard talk thus in the ſame Style, was in amaze, and bleſs'd himſelf for wonder, as did the reſt of the Company; till <hi>Sancho Pança</hi> coming up, to mend the Matter, Look ye, Sirs, ſaid he, I will ſpeak the truth, take it well, or take it ill. My Maſter here, is no more inchanted than my Mother: He's in his ſober Sences, he eats and drinks, and does his Needs, like other Folks, and as he us'd to do; and yet you'll perſwade me that a Man, who can do all this, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted forſooth; he can ſpeak too, for if you'll let him alone, he'll prattle you more than thirty Attorneys. Then turning towards the Curate, O Mr. Curate, Mr. Curate, continu'd he, do you think I don't know you, and that I don't gueſs what all theſe new Inchantments drive at! Yes I do know you well enough, for all you hide your
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:54446:318"/>
Face; and underſtand your Deſign, for all your ſly Tricks, Sir. But 'tis an old Saying, There's no ſtriving againſt the Stream; and the Weakeſt ſtill goes to the Wall. The Devil take the luck on't; had not your Reverence ſpoil'd our ſport, my Maſter had been marry'd before now to the Princeſs <hi>Micomicona,</hi> and I had been an Earl at leaſt; nay that I was ſure of, had the worſt come to the worſt; but the old Proverb is true again, Fortune turns round like a Mill Wheel, and he that was yeſterday at the top, lyes to day at the bottom. I wonder, Mr. Curate, you that are a Clergyman ſhou'd not have more Conſcience; conſider, Sir, that I have a Wife and Family who expect all to be great Folks, and my Maſter here is to do a World of good Deeds; and don't you think, Sir, that you won't be made to anſwer for all this one day. Snuff me thoſe Candles ſaid the Barber, hearing <hi>Sancho</hi> talk at this rate, What, Fool! are you brainſick of your Maſter's Diſeaſe too? if you be, you're like to bear him Company in his Cage I'll aſſure you Friend. What inchanted Iſland is this that floats in your Scull, or what Succubus has been riding thy Fancy, and got it with Child of theſe Hopes? With Child! Sir, what dy'e mean Sir, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> I ſcorn your Words, Sir; the beſt Lord in the Land ſhou'd not get me with Child, no, not the King himſelf, Heaven bleſs him. For tho' I'm a poor Man, yet I'm an honeſt Man, and an old Chriſtian, and don't owe any Man a Farthing; and tho' I deſire Iſlands, there are o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>her Folks, not far off, that deſire worſe things. Every one is the Son of his own Works; I am a Man and may be Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> much ſooner Governour of an Iſland, eſpecially conſidering my Maſter may gain ſo many as he may want Perſons to beſtow 'em on. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pray Mr. Barber take heed what you ſay; for
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:54446:319"/>
all conſiſts not in ſhaving of Beards, and there's ſome difference between a Hawk and a Hand-ſaw. I ſay ſo, becauſe we all know one another, and no Body ſhall put a falſe Card upon me. As to my Maſter's Inchantment let it ſtand, as it is, Heaven knows beſt; and a Stink is ſtill worſe for the ſtirring. The Barber thought Silence the beſt way to quiet <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Impertience; and the Curate, doubting that he might ſpoil all, intreated the Canon to put on a little before, and he wou'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold the Miſtery of the encag'd Knight, which perhaps he would find one of the pleaſanteſt Stories he had ever heard: The Canon rid forward with him, and his Men follow'd, while the Curate made them a Relation of Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Life and Quality, and Madneſs and Adventures, with the original Cauſe of his Diſtraction, and the whole Progreſs of his Adventures till his being ſhut up in the Cage, to get him home in order to have him cur'd. They all admir'd at this ſtrange Account, and then the Canon turning to the Curate.</p>
                           <p>Believe me, Mr. Curate, ſaid he, I am fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd that theſe they call Books of Knight-Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantry, are very prejudicial to the Publick. And tho' I have been led away by an idle and falſe Pleaſure, to read the beginnings of almoſt as many of 'em as have been Printed, I could never yet perſwade my ſelf to go through with any one to the end; for to me they all ſeem to contain one and the ſame thing, and there is as much in one of them as in all the reſt. The whole Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Style reſemble that of the Mileſian Fables, which are a ſort of idle Stories, deſign'd only for Diverſion, and not for Inſtruction. It is not ſo with thoſe Fables which are call'd Apologues, that at once delight and inſtruct. But tho' the main deſign of ſuch Books is to pleaſe,
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:54446:319"/>
yet I cannot conceive how it is poſſible they ſhould perform it, being fill'd with ſuch a multitude of unaccountable Extravagancies. For the Pleaſure which ſtrikes the Soul muſt be deriv'd from the Beauty and Congruity it ſees or conceives in thoſe things the Sight or Imagination lays be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it; and nothing in it ſelf deformed or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous, can give us any real Satisfaction. Now what Beauty can there be, or what Proportion of the Parts to the whole, or of the whole to the ſeveral Parts, in a Book, or Fable, where a Stripling at Sixteen Years of Age, at one Cut of a Sword, cleaves a Giant as tall as a Steeple through the middle, as eaſily as if he were made of Paſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board? Or when they give us the Relation of a Battle, having ſaid the Enemy's Power conſiſted of a Million of Combatants; yet provided the Hero of the Book be againſt them, we muſt of neceſſity, tho' never ſo much againſt our Inclination, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the ſaid Knight obtain'd the Victory only by his own Valour and the Strength of his powerful Arm? And what ſhall we ſay of the great eaſe and facility with which an abſolute Queen or Empreſs caſts her ſelf into the Arms of an Errant and unknown Knight? What Mortal not altogether barbarous and unpoliſh'd can be pleas'd to read, that a great Tower full of armed Knights cuts through the Sea like a Ship before the Wind; and ſetting out in the Evening from the Coaſt of <hi>Italy,</hi> lands by break of Day in <hi>Preſter John</hi>'s Country, or in ſome other never known to <hi>Ptolomy</hi> or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd by <hi>Columbus?</hi> If it ſhould be anſwer'd, That thoſe Perſons who Compoſe theſe Books, write them as confeſs'd Lies; and therefore are not oblig'd to obſerve Niceties, or have regard to Truth; I ſhall make this Reply, That Falſe-hood is ſo much the more commendable, by how much
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:54446:320"/>
it more reſembles Truth, and is the more pleaſing, the more it is doubtful and poſſible. Fabulous Tales ought to be ſuited to the Reader's Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, being ſo contriv'd that all Impoſſibilities ceaſing, all great Accidents appearing eaſie, and the Mind wholly hanging in ſuſpence, they may at once ſurprize, aſtoniſh, pleaſe and divert; ſo that Pleaſure and Admiration may go Hand in Hand. This cannot be perform'd by him that flies from Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Imitation, which is the Perfection of what is written. I have not yet ſeen any Book of Knight-Errantry, that compoſes an entire Body of a Fable with all its Parts, ſo that the middle is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the beginning, and the end to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and middle; but on the contrary, they form them of ſo many Limbs, that they rather ſeem to deſign a Chimera or Monſter, than a well proportion'd Figure. Beſides all this, their Style is uncouth, their Exploits incredible, their Love immodeſt, their Civility impertinent, their Battels tedious, their Language abſurd, their Voyages pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous; and in ſhort, they are altogether void of ſolid Ingenuity, and therefore fit to be baniſh'd a Chriſtian Commonwealth, as uſeleſs and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial. The Curate was very attentive, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd him a Man of a ſound Judgment and much in the right in all he had urg'd; and therefore told him, That he being of the ſame Opinion, and an Enemy to Books of Knight-Errantry, had burnt all that belong'd to Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> which were a conſiderable number. Then he recounted to him the ſcrutiny he had made among them, what he had condemn'd to the Flames, and what ſpar'd; at which the Canon laugh'd heartily, and ſaid, That notwithſtanding all the harm he had ſpoken of thoſe Books, yet he found one good thing in them, which was the Subject they furniſh'd a
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:54446:320"/>
Man of Underſtanding with to exerciſe his Parts, becauſe they allow a large Scope for the Pen to dilate without any check, deſcribing Shipwrecks, Storms, Skirmiſhes and Battles; repreſenting to us a brave Commander, with all the Qualifications requiſite in ſuch a one, ſhewing his Prudence in diſappointing the Deſigns of the Enemy, his Eloquence in perſuading or diſſuading his Souldiers, his Judgment in Council, his Celerity in Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and his Valour in aſſailing or repulſing an Aſſault; laying before us ſometimes a diſmal and melancholly Accident, ſometimes a delightful and unexpected Adventure; in one place, a beautiful, modeſt, diſcreet and reſerv'd Lady; in another, a Chriſtian-like, brave and courteous Gentleman; here a boiſterous, inhuman boaſting Ruffian, there an affable warlike and wiſe Prince; lively expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Fidelity and Loyalty of Subjects, Generoſity and Bounty of Sovereigns. He may no leſs at times make kown his Skill in Aſtrology, Coſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy, Muſick and Policy; and if he pleaſes, he cannot want an Opportunity of appearing knowing even in Necromancy. He may deſcribe the Subtilty of <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> the Piety of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> the Valour of <hi>Achilles,</hi> the Misfortunes of <hi>Hector,</hi> the Treachery of <hi>Sinon,</hi> the Friendſhip of <hi>Euryalus,</hi> the Liberality of <hi>Alexander,</hi> the Valour of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the Clemency and Sincerity of <hi>Trajan,</hi> the Fidelity of <hi>Zopyrus,</hi> the Prudence of <hi>Cato;</hi> and in fine, all thoſe Actions that may make up a compleat Hero, ſometimes at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing them all to one Perſon, and at other times dividing them among many. This being ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd in a grateful Stile, and with ingenious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, approaching as much as poſſible to Truth, will doubtleſs compoſe ſo beautiful and various a Work, that, when finiſh'd, its Excellency and Perfection muſt attain the beſt end of Writing,

which is at once to delight and inſtruct, as I have ſaid before: For the looſe Method practis'd in theſe Books, gives the Author liberty to play the Epick, the Lyrick, and the Dramatick Poet, and to run through all the other parts of Poetry and Rhetorick; for Epicks may be as well writ in Proſe as in Verſe.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. XXI.</hi> Containing a Continuation of the Canon's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon Books of Knight-Errantry, and other curious Matters.</head>
                           <p>YOU are much in the right, Sir, reply'd the Curate; and therefore thoſe who have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto publiſh'd Books of that Kind, are the more to be blam'd, for having had no Regard to good Senſe, Art or Rules; by the Obſervation of which they might have made themſelves as famous in Proſe, as the two Princes of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Poetry are in Verſe. I muſt confeſs, ſaid the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, I was once tempted to write a Book of Knight-Errantry my ſelf, obſerving all thoſe Rules; and to ſpeak the Truth, I writ above an hundred Pages, which, for a better Tryal, whether they anſwered my Expectation, I communicated to ſome Learned and Judicious Men fond of thoſe Subjects, as well as to ſome of thoſe ignorant Perſons, who only are delighted with Extravagancies; and they all gave me a ſatisfactory Approbation. And yet I made no farther Progreſs, as well in regard I look upon it to be a thing no way agreeable with my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:54446:321"/>
as becauſe I am ſenſible the Illiterate are much more numerous than the Learned; and tho' it is better to be commended by the ſmall Number of the Wiſe, than ſcorn'd by the ignorant Multitude, yet I will not expoſe my ſelf to the Cenſure of the giddy Vulgar, whoſe principal Buſineſs it is to read ſuch Books. But the greateſt Motive I had to lay aſide, and think no more of finiſhing it, was an Argument I form'd to my ſelf, deduc'd from the Plays now uſually acted: For, thought I, if Plays now in uſe, as well thoſe which are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Poet's Invention, as thoſe that are grounded upon Hiſtory, be all of them, or at leaſt the greateſt part, made up of moſt abſurd Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies and Incoherences; and yet the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude ſees them with Satisfaction, eſteems and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves them, tho' they are ſo far from being good; if the Poets who write, and the Players who act them, ſay they muſt be ſo contriv'd and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, becauſe they pleaſe the Generality of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and if thoſe which are regular and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Art, ſerve only to pleaſe half a ſcore judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Perſons who underſtand them, whilſt the reſt of the Company cannot reach the Contrivance; and therefore the Poets and Actors ſay, they had rather get their Bread by the greater Number, than the Applauſe of the leſs: Then may I conclude the ſame will be the Succeſs of this Book; ſo that when I have rack'd my Brain to obſerve the Rules, I ſhall reap no other Advantage than to be laugh'd at for my Pains. I have ſometimes endeavour'd to convince the Actors that they are deceiv'd in their Opinion, and that they will draw more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and get better Credit by regular Plays, than by thoſe prepoſterous Repreſentations now in uſe; but they are ſo poſitive in their Humour, that no Strength of Reaſon, nor even Demonſtration, can
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:54446:322"/>
divert them from their Conceit. I remember I once was talking to one of thoſe obſtinate Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; Do you not remember, ſaid I, that within theſe few Years three Tragedies were acted in <hi>Spain,</hi> written by a famous Poet of ours, which were ſo excellent, that they ſurpriz'd, delighted, and rais'd the Admiration of all that ſaw them, as well the Ignorant as the Judicious; and the Actors got more by thoſe three, than by thirty of the beſt that have been writ ſince? Doubtleſs, Sir, ſaid the Actor, you mean the Tragedies of <hi>Iſabella, Phillis,</hi> and <hi>Alexandra?</hi> The very ſame, I reply'd, and do you judge whether they obſerv'd the Rules of the Drama, and whether by doing ſo they loſt any thing of their Eſteem, or fail'd of pleaſing all ſorts of People? So that the Fault lies not in the Audience's deſiring Abſurdities, but in thoſe who know not how to give 'em any thing elſe. Nor was there any thing prepoſterous in ſeveral other Plays, as for Example, <hi>Ingratitude reveng'd, Numan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia, the amorouss Merchant,</hi> and <hi>the favourable Enemy,</hi> nor in ſome others, compos'd by judicious Poets to their Honour and Credit, and to the Advantage of thoſe that acted them. Much more I added, which in my Opinion, ſomewhat confounded, but no way ſatisfy'd or convinc'd him, ſo as to change his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. You have touch'd upon a Subject, Sir, ſaid the Curate, which has ſtirr'd up in me an old A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion I have for the Plays now in uſe, which is not inferior to that I bear to Books of Knight-Errantry. For whereas Plays, according to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of <hi>Cicero,</hi> ought to be Mirrors of Humane Life, Patterns of good Manners, and the very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives of Truth; thoſe now acted are Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of Abſurdities, Patterns of Follies, and Images of Lewdneſs. For inſtance, What can be more abſurd than for the ſame Perſon to be
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:54446:322"/>
brought on the Stage a Child in Swadling-bands, in the firſt Scene of the firſt Act, and to appear in the ſecond grown a Man? What can be more ridiculous than to repreſent to us a fighting old Fellow, a cowardly Youth, a rhetorical Footman, a politick Page, a churliſh King, and an unpoliſh'd Princeſs. What ſhall I ſay of their Regard to the Time in which thoſe Actions they repreſent either might or ought to have happen'd, having ſeen a Play, in which the firſt Act began in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> the ſecond in <hi>Aſia,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">'Tis to be obſerved, that the Spaniſh Plays have only three Jornadas or Acts.</note> and the third ended in <hi>Africk?</hi> Probably, if there had been another Act, they would have carry'd it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>America;</hi> and thus it would have been acted in the four Parts of the World. But if Imitation be a principal part of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, how can any tolerable Judgment be pleas'd, when, repreſenting an Action that happen'd in the time of King <hi>Pepin</hi> or <hi>Charlemaign,</hi> they ſhall attribute it to the Emperor <hi>Heraclius,</hi> and bring him in carrying the Croſs into <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the Holy Sepulchre, like <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> there being a vaſt diſtance of time betwixt theſe Actions? Thus they will clap together Pieces of Hiſtory in a Play of their own framing, mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it Relations of things that have happen'd to different People and in ſeveral Ages. This they do without any Contrivance that might make it the more probable, and with ſuch viſible Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes as are altogether inexcuſable; but the worſt of it is, that there are Idiots who look upon this as Perfection, and think every thing elſe to be mere Pedantry. But if we look into the pious Plays, what a multitude of falſe Miracles ſhall we find in them, how many Errors and Contradictions,
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:54446:323"/>
how often the Miracles wrought by one Saint at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to another? Nay even in the prophane Plays, they preſume to work Miracles upon the bare Imagination, and conceit that ſuch a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Work, or a Machine, as they call it, will be Ornamental, and draw the common ſort to ſee the Play.</p>
                           <p>Theſe things are a reflection upon Truth it ſelf, a leſſ'ning of Hiſtory, and a Reproach to all Spaniſh Wits; becauſe Strangers, who are very exact in obſerving the Rules of the Drama, look upon us as an ignorant and barbarous People, when they ſee the Abſurdities and Extravagancies of our Plays. Nor would it be any Excuſe to alledge, that the principal Deſign of all good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in permitting Plays to be publickly acted, is to amuſe the Commonalty with ſome lawful Recreation, and ſo to divert thoſe ill Humours which Idleneſs is apt to breed: And that ſince this end is attain'd by any ſort of Plays, whether good or bad, it is needleſs to preſcribe Laws to them, or oblige the Poets or Actors to compoſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent ſuch as are approv'd by them. I ſay that this end propos'd would be infinitely better an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd by good Plays, than by bad ones. He who ſees a Play that is regular and anſwerable to the Rules of Poetry, is pleas'd with the Comedy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by the ſerious part, ſurpriz'd at the variety of Accidents, improv'd by the Language, warn'd by Frauds, inſtructed by Examples, incens'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Vice, and enamour'd with Virtue; for a good Play muſt cauſe all theſe Emotions in the Soul of him that ſees it, tho' he were never ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible and unpoliſh'd. And it is abſolutely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that a Play which has all theſe Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſhould not infinitely divert, ſatisfy and
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:54446:323"/>
pleaſe, beyond another that wants them, as moſt of them do which are now uſually acted. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are the Poets who write them in Fault, for ſome of them are very ſenſible of their Errors, and capable of performing their Duty; but Plays being now altogether become Venial, they ſay, and with reaſon, that the Actors would not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe them, unleſs they were of that Stamp; and therefore the Poet endeavours to ſuit the Humour of the Actor, who is to pay him for his Labour. For proof of this, let any Man obſerve that infinite number of Plays compos'd by an exuberant Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Wit,<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Lope de Vega,</hi> who writ an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible number of Plays.</note> ſo full of Gaity and Humour, in ſuch lofty Verſe and Language, ſo ſententious, and to conclude, in ſuch a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtick Stile, that his Fame is ſpread through the Univerſe. Yet becauſe he ſuited himſelf to the Fancy of the Actors, many of them have fallen ſhort of their due Perfection, tho' ſome have reach'd it. Others write Plays ſo inconſiderately, that after they have appear'd on the Stage, the Actors have been forc'd to fly and abſcond for fear of being puniſh'd, as it has often happen'd, for having affronted Kings and diſhonour'd whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies. Theſe and many other ill Conſequences I omit would ceaſe, by appointing an intelligent and judicious Perſon at Court to examine all Plays be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were acted, that is, not only thoſe which are repreſented at Court, but throughout all <hi>Spain;</hi> So that without his Licenſe no Magiſtrate ſhould ſuffer any Play to appear in publick. Thus Players would be careful to ſend their Plays to Court, and might then act them with ſafety, and thoſe who write would be more circumſpect, as ſtanding in
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:54446:324"/>
Awe of an Examiner that could judge of their Works. By theſe means we ſhould be furniſh'd with good Plays, and the end they are deſign'd for would be attain'd, the People diverted, the Spaniſh Wits eſteem'd, the Actors ſecur'd, and the Government ſav'd the trouble of puniſhing them. And if the ſame Perſon, or another, were intruſted to examine all new Books of Knight-Errantry, there is no doubt but ſome might be publiſh'd with all that Perfection you, Sir, have mention'd, to the encreaſe of Eloquence in our Language, to the utter extirpation of the old Books which would be born down by the new; and for the innocent Paſtime, not only of idle Perſons, but of thoſe who have moſt Employment; for the Bow cannot always ſtand bent, nor can humane Frailty ſubſiſt without ſome lawful Recreation.</p>
                           <p>The Canon and Curate were come to this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, when the Barber, overtaking them, told the latter that this was the place he had pitch'd on for baiting, during the Heat of the Day. The Canon induc'd by the pleaſantneſs of the Valley, and the ſatisfaction he found in the Curate's Converſation, as well as to be farther inform'd of Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Adventures, bore them Company, giving order to ſome of his Men to ride to the next Inn; and if his Sumpter-mule were arriv'd, to ſend him down all Proviſions to that Valley, where the coolneſs of the Shade, and the beauty of the Proſpect gave him a fair invitation to Dine; and that they ſhou'd make much of themſelves and their Mules with what the Inn cou'd afford.</p>
                           <p>In the mean time, <hi>Sancho</hi> having diſengag'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the Curate and Barber, and finding an opportunity to ſpeak to his Maſter alone, he bruſh'd up to the Cage where the Knight ſate.
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:54446:324"/>
That I may clear my Conſcience, Sir, ſaid he, 'tis fitting that I tell you the plain truth of your Inchantment here: Who, wou'd you think now, are thoſe two Fellows that ride with their Faces cover'd? Even the Parſon of our Pariſh, and the Barber; none elſe I'll aſſure you, Sir. And they are in a Plot againſt you, out of meer ſpight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe your Deeds will be greater than theirs: This being preſuppos'd, it follows, that you are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted, but only cozen'd and abus'd; and if you'll but anſwer me one Queſtion fairly and ſquarely, you ſhall find this out to be a palpable Cheat, and that there is no Inchantment in the Caſe, but meerly your Senſes turn'd topſy turvy.</p>
                           <p>Ask me what Queſtions you pleaſe, dear <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid the Knight, and I will as willingly reſolve them. But for thy Aſſertion, that thoſe who guard us, are my old Companions the Curate and Barber, 'tis Illuſion all. The power of Magick indeed, as it has an Art to cloath any thing in any Shape, may have dreſs'd theſe Daemons in their Appearances to infatuate thy Senſe, and draw thee into ſuch a labyrinth of Confuſion, that even <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus</hi>'s Clue cou'd not extricate thee out of it; and this with a deſign perhaps to plunge me deeper into Doubts, and make me endanger my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in ſearching into the ſtrange Contrivance of my Inchantment, which in every Circumſtance is ſo different from all I ever read. Therefore reſt ſatisfy'd that theſe are no more what thou ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'ſt, than I am a Turk. But now to thy Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, propoſe them, and I will endeavour to anſwer.</p>
                           <p>Bleſs me, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> this is Madneſs upon Madneſs; but ſince 'tis ſo, anſwer me one Queſtion. Tell me; as you hope to be deliver'd out of this
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:54446:325"/>
Cage here, and as you hope to find your ſelf in my Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi>'s Arms when you leaſt think on't; as you—Conjure me no more, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> but ask freely, for I have promis'd to anſwer punctually. That's what I want, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> and you muſt tell me the truth, and the whole truth, neither more nor leſs, upon the Honour of your Knighthood. Prithee no more of your Preliminaries or Preambles, cry'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> I tell thee I will Anſwer to a tittle. Then, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> I ask, with reverence be it ſpoken, whether your Worſhip ſince your being Cag'd up, or inchanted, if you will have it ſo, has not had a Motion, more or leſs, as a Man may ſay? I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not that Phraſe, anſwer'd the Knight. Heighday! quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> don't you know what I mean? Why there's ne'er a Child in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that underſtands the Chriſt-croſs-Row, but can tell you. I mean, have you a mind to do what another can't do for you. O now I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thee, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid the Knight; and to anſwer directly to thy Queſtion, poſitively yes, very often; and therefore prithee help me out of this ſtreight; for, to be free with you, I am not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſo ſweet and clean as I cou'd wiſh.</p>

                           <p>AH! Sir, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> have I caught you at laſt? This is what I wanted to know from my Heart and Soul. Come, Sir, you can't deny, that when any Body is out of ſorts, ſo as not to eat, or drink, or ſleep, or do any natural Occaſions that you gueſs, then we ſay commonly they're be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch'd or ſo: From whence may be gather'd, that thoſe who can eat their Meat, drink their Drink, ſpeak when they're ſpoken to, and go to the Back-ſide when they have Occaſion for't, are not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch'd nor inchanted. Your Concluſion is good, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> as to one ſort of Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but, as I ſaid to thee, there's Variety of Inchantments, and the Changes in them thro' the Alteration of Times and Cuſtoms branch them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo many Parts, that 'tis impoſſible to fix them under the Force of any ſingle Concluſion. In my own Conſcience I am verily perſwaded of my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment, and this ſuppreſſes any Uneaſineſs in my Temper, which might ariſe upon any Suggeſtion to the contrary. To think my ſelf thus idly and diſhonourably born about in a Cage, and with held like a lazy idle Coward from the great Offices of my Function, when at this Hour perhaps hundreds
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:54446:326"/>
of Wretches may want my Aſſiſtance, wou'd be unſupportable. Then your Worſhip's only Way, is to endeavour to get your Heels at Liberty, ſaid <hi>Sancho.</hi> Come, Sir, let me alone, I'll get you out I warrant you; and then get you on your truſty <hi>Rozinante</hi>'s Back, and a Fig for them all. The poor thing here jogs on as drooping and heartleſs, as if he were inchanted too. Take my Advice for once now, and if things don't go as your Heart cou'd wiſh, we have Time enough to creep into our Cage again, and on the Word of a loyal Squire I'll go in with you, and be content to be inchanted as long as you pleaſe.</p>
                           <p>I commit the Care of my Freedom to thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote:</hi> Lay Hold on the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> and thou ſhalt find me ready to be govern'd in all Particulars; tho' I am ſtill afraid thou wilt find thy Cunning ſtrangely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-reach'd in thy pretended Diſcovery. The Knight and Squire had laid their Plot, when they reach'd the Place that the Canon, Curate, and Barber had pitch'd upon to alight in. The Cage was taken down, and the Oxen unyoak'd to graze; when <hi>Sancho</hi> addreſſing the Curate, Pray, ſaid he, will you do ſo much as let my Lord and Maſter come out a little to ſlack a Point, or elſe the Priſon will not be ſo clean as the Preſence of ſo worthy a Knight as my Maſter requires. The Curate under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding him, anſwer'd that he wou'd comply, but that he fear'd Don <hi>Quixote</hi> finding himſelf once at Liberty, wou'd give them the Slip. I'll be Bail for him, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> Body for Body, Sir; and I, ſaid the Canon, upon his bare Parole of Honour. That you ſhall have, ſaid the Knight; beſides, you need no Security beyond the Power of Art, for inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Bodies have no Free-will to diſpoſe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:54446:326"/>
nor to move from one Place to another, without Permiſſion of the Necromancer in whoſe Charge they are. The magical Charms might rivet 'em for three whole Centuries to one Place, and fetch 'em back ſwift as the Wind, ſhould the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted have fled to ſome other Region. Laſtly, as a moſt convincing Argument for his Releaſe, he urg'd, That unleſs they would free him, or get farther off, he would be neceſſitated to offend their Senſe of Smelling. They gueſs'd his Meaning pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, and gave him his Liberty; and the firſt uſe he made of it was to ſtretch his benum'd Limbs three or four times; then marching up to <hi>Rozinante,</hi> he ſlapp'd him twice or thrice on the Buttocks: I truſt in Heaven, thou Flower and Glory of Horſe-fleſh, ſaid he, that we ſhall ſoon be reſtor'd to our former Circumſtances; I, mounted on thy Back, and Thou between my Legs, while I exerciſe the Function for which Heaven has beſtow'd me on the World. Then walking a little aſide with <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> he return'd, after a convenient Stay, much lighter in Body and Mind, and very full of his Squire's Project.</p>
                           <p>The Canon gaz'd on him, admiring his unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralell'd ſort of Madneſs, the rather, becauſe in all his Words and Anſwers he diſplay'd an excellent Judgment, and, as we have already obſerv'd, he only rav'd when the Diſcourſe fell upon Knight-Errantry: Which moving the Canon to Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when they had all ſeated themſelves on the Graſs, expecting the coming up of his Sumpter-Mule; Is it poſſible, Sir, ſaid he, addreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> that the unhappy reading of Books of Knight-Errantry ſhould have ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence over you as to deſtroy your Reaſon, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you believe you are now inchanted, and many
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:54446:327"/>
other ſuch Extravagancies, as remote from Truth as Truth it ſelf is from Falſhood? How is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that human Senſe ſhou'd conceive there ever were in the World ſuch Multitudes of famous Knights-Errant, ſo many Emperors of <hi>Trebizond,</hi> ſo many <hi>Amadis</hi>'s, <hi>Felixmartes</hi> of <hi>Hircania,</hi> Palfreys, rambling Damſels, Serpents, Monſters, Giants, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of Adventures, ſo many ſorts of Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo many Battles, terrible Encounters, pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous Habits and Tournaments, amorous Princeſſes, Earls, Squires, and jeſting Dwarfs, ſo many Love-Letters and Gallantries, ſo many Amazonian La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and, in ſhort, ſuch an incredible Number of extravagant Paſſages, as are contain'd in Books of Knight-Errantry? As for my own Particular, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that while I read 'em, and do not reflect that they are nothing but Falſhood and Folly, they give me ſome Satisfaction; but I no ſooner remember what they are, but I caſt the beſt of them from me, and wou'd deliver them up to the Flames if I had a Fire near me; as well deſerving that Fate, like falſe Impoſtors that act contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Courſe of Nature; and Inventors of new Sects, and a new Manner of Living, that ſeduce the ignorant Vulgar to give Credit to all their Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities: Nay, they preſume to diſturb the Brains of ingenious and well-bred Gentlemen, as appears by the Effect they have wrought on your Judgment, having reduc'd you to ſuch a Condition, that it is neceſſary to ſhut you up in a Cage, and carry you on a Cart drawn by Oxen, like ſome Lion or Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that is carry'd about from Town to Town to be ſhewn.

which may be ſafer for your Conſcience, and more for your Honour: But if led away by your natural Inclination, you will read Books of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry and great Exploits; read in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the Book of <hi>Judges,</hi> where you will find won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Truths and glorious Actions not to be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion'd. <hi>Luſitania</hi> had a <hi>Viriatus, Rome</hi> a <hi>Caeſar, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi> an <hi>Hannibal, Greece</hi> an <hi>Alexander, Caſtile</hi> a Count <hi>Fernan Gonzalez, Valentia</hi> a <hi>Cid, Andaluzia</hi> a <hi>Gonzalo Fernandes, Eſtremadura</hi> a <hi>Diego Garcia de Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, Xerez</hi> a <hi>Garcia Perez de Vergas, Toledo</hi> a <hi>Garcilaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,</hi> and <hi>Sevil</hi> Don <hi>Manuel de Leon;</hi> the reading of whoſe brave Actions diverts, inſtructs, pleaſes, and ſurprizes the moſt judicious Readers. This will be a Study worthy your Talent, and by which you will become well read in Hiſtory, in love with Virtue, knowing in Goodneſs, improv'd in Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, brave without Raſhneſs, and cautious without Cowardice; all which will redound to the Glory of God, your own Advancement, and the Honour of the Province of <hi>La Mancha,</hi> whence I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand you derive your Original. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd with great Attention to the Canon's Diſcourſe, and perceiving he had done, after he had fix'd his Eyes on him for a conſiderable Space, Sir, ſaid he, all your Diſcourſe, I find, tends to ſignify to me, there never were any Knights-Errant, that all the Books of Knight-Errantry are falſe, fabulous, uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and prejudicial to the Publick; that I have done ill in reading, err'd in believing, and been much to blame in imitating them, by taking upon me the moſt painful Profeſſion of Chivalry. And you deny that ever there were any <hi>Amadiſes</hi> of <hi>Gaul</hi> or <hi>Greece,</hi> or any of thoſe Knights mentioned in thoſe Books. Even as you have ſaid, Sir, ſaid the Canon. You alſo were pleas'd to add, continu'd
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:54446:328"/>
Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> that thoſe Books had been very hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to me, having depriv'd me of my Reaſon, and reduc'd me to be carry'd in a Cage; that therefore it wou'd be for my Advantage to take up in Time, and apply my ſelf to the reading of other Books, where I might find more Truth, more Pleaſure, and better Inſtruction. You are in the Right, ſaid the Canon. Then I am ſatisfy'd, reply'd Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote,</hi> you your ſelf are the Man that raves and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted, ſince you have thus boldly blaſphem'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Truth ſo univerſally receiv'd, that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver preſumes to contradict it, as you have done, deſerves the Puniſhment you wou'd inflict on the Books, when in reading them they offend you. For it were as eaſy to perſwade the World that the Sun does not enlighten, the Froſt cool, and the Earth bear us, as that there never was an <hi>Amadis,</hi> or any of the other adventurous Knights, whoſe Actions are the Subject of ſo many Hiſtories. What Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal can perſwade another, that there is no Truth in what is recorded of the Princeſs <hi>Floripes,</hi> and <hi>Guy</hi> of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and of <hi>Fierabras</hi> at the Bridge of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Charlemaign?</hi> which Paſſages, I dare ſwear, are as true as that now it is Day. But if this be falſe, you may as well ſay there was no <hi>Hector,</hi> nor <hi>Achilles,</hi> nor a <hi>Trojan</hi> War, nor Twelve Peers of <hi>France,</hi> nor a King <hi>Arthur</hi> of <hi>Britain,</hi> who is now converted into a Crow, and hourly expected in his Kingdom. Some alſo may preſume to ſay, that the Hiſtory of <hi>Guerino Meſchino,</hi> and that of the Search after the <hi>Sangrial</hi> are both falſe, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of Sir <hi>Triſtan</hi> and Queen <hi>Iſeo</hi> are Apocryphal, as well as thoſe of Queen <hi>Guiniver</hi> and Sir <hi>Lancelot du Lake;</hi> and yet there are People living who can almoſt remember they have ſeen the old Lady <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanona,</hi> who had the beſt Hand at filling a Glaſs of
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:54446:328"/>
Wine of any Woman in all <hi>Britain.</hi> This I am ſo well aſſur'd of, that I can remember my Grandmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by my Father's Side, whenever ſhe ſaw an old Governante in her long Gown, us'd to tell me, Look yonder, Grandſon, there's an old Woman looks like Dame <hi>Quintanona;</hi> whence I infer, ſhe knew her, or at leaſt had ſeen her Picture. Now, who can deny the Veracity of the Hiſtory of <hi>Pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi> and the lovely <hi>Magalona,</hi> when to this Day the Pin with which the brave <hi>Pierres</hi> turn'd his wooden Horſe that carry'd him through the Air, is to be ſeen in the King's Armory; which Pin is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what bigger than the Thill of a Waggon, by the ſame Token it ſtands juſt by <hi>Babieca</hi>'s Saddle. At <hi>Ronceſvalles</hi> they keep <hi>Orlando</hi>'s Horn, that is as big as a great Beam; whence it follows that there were Twelve Peers, that there were ſuch Men as <hi>Pierres,</hi> and the famous <hi>Cid,</hi> beſides many other adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Knights, whoſe Names are in the Mouths of all People. You may as well tell me, that the brave <hi>Portugues, John de Merlo,</hi> was no Knight-Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; that he did not go into <hi>Burgundy,</hi> where, in the City of <hi>Ras,</hi> he fought the famous <hi>Moſes Pierre,</hi> Lord of <hi>Chargny,</hi> and in the City of <hi>Baſil, Moſes Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry de Rameſtan,</hi> coming off in both Places victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and loaded with Honour. You may deny the Adventures and Combats of the two heroick <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, Pedro Barba</hi> and <hi>Gutierre Quixada,</hi> (from whoſe Male Line I am lineally deſcended) who in <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> overcame the Sons of the Earl of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> You may tell that Don <hi>Ferdinand de Guevara</hi> never went into <hi>Germany</hi> to ſeek Adventures, where he fought Sir <hi>George,</hi> a Knight of the Duke of <hi>Auſtria</hi>'s Court. You may ſay the Tilting of <hi>Suero de Quinnones del Paſſo,</hi> and the Exploits of <hi>Moſes Lewis de Falſes</hi> againſt Don <hi>Gonzalo de Guzman</hi> a <hi>Caſtilian</hi> Knight, are meer
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:54446:329"/>
Fables; and ſo of many other brave Actions per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by Chriſtian Knights, as well <hi>Spaniards</hi> as Foreigners, which are ſo authentick and true, that, I ſay it over again, he who denies them has nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Senſe nor Reaſon. The Canon was aſtoniſh'd at the Medley Don <hi>Quixote</hi> made of Truths and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and no leſs to ſee how well-read he was in all things relating to the Atchievements of Knights-Errant; and therefore, I cannot deny, Sir, anſwer'd he, but that there is ſome Truth in what you have ſaid eſpecially in what relates to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Knights-Errant; and I will grant there were Twelve Peers of <hi>France,</hi> yet I will not believe they perform'd all thoſe Actions Archbiſhop <hi>Turpin</hi> aſcribes to them: I rather imagine they were brave Gentlemen made Choice of by the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> and call'd Peers, as being all equal in Valour and Quality; or if they were not, at leaſt they ought to have been ſo; and theſe compos'd a ſort of military Order, like thoſe of <hi>Sant Jago</hi> or <hi>Calatrava</hi> among us, into which all that are admitted are ſuppos'd, or ought to be, Gentlemen of Birth and known Valour. And as now we ſay a Knight of St. <hi>John</hi> or of <hi>Alcantara,</hi> ſo in thoſe Times they ſaid, A Knight who is one of the Twelve Peers, becauſe they were but Twelve of this military Order. Nor is it to be doubted but that there were ſuch Men as <hi>Bernardo del Carpio</hi> and the <hi>Cid,</hi> yet we have Reaſon to queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever they perform'd thoſe great Exploits that are aſcrib'd to them. As to the Pin, Count <hi>Plerre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </hi>'s Pin which you ſpoke of, and which you ſay ſtands by <hi>Babieca</hi>'s Saddle, I own my Ignorance, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I am ſo ſhort-ſighted, that tho' I ſaw the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle yet I did not perceive the Pin, which is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſtrange if it be ſo large as you deſcrib'd it. 'Tis there without Doubt, reply'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> by
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:54446:329"/>
the ſame Token they ſay it is kept in a Leathern Caſe to keep it from ruſting. That may very well be, ſaid the Canon, but upon the Word of a Prieſt I do not remember I ever ſaw it: Yet grant it were there, that does not enforce the Belief of ſo many <hi>Amadiſes,</hi> nor of ſuch a Multitude of Knights-Errant as the World talks of; nor is there any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo worthy a Perſon, ſo judicious, and ſo well qualify'd as you are, ſhou'd imagine there is any Truth in the wild Extravagancies contain'd in all the fabulous nonſenſical Books of Knight-Erran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. XXIII.</hi> The notable Diſpute between the Canon and Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> with other Matters.</head>
                           <p>VERY well, cry'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> then all thoſe Books muſt be Fabulous, tho' licens'd by Kings, approv'd by the Examiners, read with ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Satisfaction, and applauded by the better ſort and the meaner, rich and poor, learned and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, gentry and commonalty, and in ſhort, by all ſorts of Perſons of what State and Condition ſoever; and tho' they carry ſuch an Appearance of Truth, ſetting down the Father, Mother, Country, Kindred, Age, Place, and Actions to a tittle, and day by day, of the Knight and Knights of whom they treat? For ſhame Sir, continu'd he, forbear uttering ſuch Blaſphemies; and believe me, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe you to behave your ſelf as becomes a Man of Senſe, or elſe read them and ſee what Satisfaction you will receive. As for Inſtance, pray tell me, can there be any thing more delightful, than to read a lively Deſcription, which as it were brings before your Eyes the following Adventure. A vaſt Lake of boiling Pitch, in which an infinite mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Serpents, Snakes, Crocodiles, and other ſorts of fierce and terrible Creatures, are ſwimming and traverſing backwards and forwards, appears to a Knight-Errant's Sight. Then from the midſt of the Lake a moſt doleful Voice is heard to ſay theſe Words: O Knight, whoever thou art, who gazeſt
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:54446:330"/>
on the dreadful Lake, if thou wilt purchaſe the Bliſs conceal'd under theſe mournful Waters, make known thy Valour by caſting thy ſelf into the midſt of theſe black burning Surges; for unleſs thou doſt ſo, thou art not worthy to behold the mighty Wonders enclos'd in the ſeven Caſtles of the ſeven Fairies, that are ſeated under theſe gloomy Waves. And no ſooner have the laſt Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents of the Voice reach'd the Knight's Ears, but be, without making any further Reflection, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the Danger to which he expoſes himſelf, and even without laying aſide ponderous Armour; only recommending himſelf to Heaven and to his Lady, plunges himſelf into the middle of the burning Lake; and when leaſt he imagines it, or can gueſs where he ſhall ſtop, he finds himſelf on a ſudden in the midſt of verdant Fields, to which the <hi>Eliſian</hi> bear no Compariſon. There the Sky appears to him more tranſparent, and the Sun ſeems to ſhine with a redoubl'd Brightneſs. Next he diſcovers a moſt delightful Grove made up of beautiful ſhady Trees, whoſe Verdure and Variety regale his Sight, while his Ears are raviſh'd with the wild and yet melodious Notes of an infinite Number of pretty painted Birds, that hop and bill and ſport themſelves on the twining Boughs. Here he ſpies a pleaſing Rivulet, which, through its ſlowry Banks, glides along over the brighteſt Sand, and remurmurs over the whiteſt Pebbles that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimple its ſmooth Surface, while that, through its Liquid Chryſtal, feaſts the Eye with a Proſpect of Gold and Orient Pearl. There he perceives an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial Fountain form'd of party-colour'd Jaſper and poliſh'd Marble; and hard by another, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd in Groteſque, where the ſmall Cockle-ſhells plac'd in orderly Confuſion among the white and
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:54446:331"/>
yellow Shells, and mix'd with pieces of bright Chryſtal and counterfeit Emeralds, yield an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Sight; ſo that Art imitating Nature, ſeems here to out do her. At a diſtance, on a ſudden, he caſts his Eyes upon a ſtrong Caſtle, or ſtately Palace, whoſe Walls are of maſſy Gold, the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements of Diamonds, and the Gates of Hyacinths; in ſhort, its Structure is ſo wonderful, that tho' all the Materials are no other than Diamonds, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncles, Rubies, Pearls, Gold, and Emeralds, yet the Workmanſhip exceeds them in Value. But having ſeen all this, can any thing be ſo charming as to behold a numerous Train of beautiful Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels come out of the Caſtle in ſuch glorious and coſtly Apparel, as would be endleſs for me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, were I to relate theſe things as they are to be found in Hiſtory. Then to ſee the Beauty that ſeems the Chief of all the Damſels, take the bold Knight, who caſt himſelf into the burning Lake, by the Hand, and without ſpeaking one Word, lead him into the ſumptuous Palace, where he is caus'd to ſtrip as naked as he was born; then put into a delicious Bath, and perfum'd with precious Eſſences and odoriferous Oils; after which he puts on a fine Shirt, deliciouſly ſcented; and this done, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Damſel throws over his Shoulders a magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Robe worth at leaſt a whole City, if not more. What a Sight is it, when in the next place they lead him into another Room of State, where he finds the Tables ſo orderly cover'd, that he is ſurpriz'd and aſtoniſh'd? There they pour over his Hands, Water diſtill'd from Amber and odoriferous Flowers: He is ſeated in an Ivory Chair; and while all the Damſels that attend him obſerve a profound Silence, ſuch Variety of Dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties is ſerv'd up, and all ſo incomparably dreſs'd,
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:54446:331"/>
that Appetite is at a ſtand, doubting on which to ſatisfy its Deſire; at the ſame time his Ears are ſweetly entertain'd with Variety of excellent Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, none perceiving who makes it, or from whence it comes. But above all, what ſhall we ſay to ſee, after the Dinner is ended, and Tables taken away, the Knight left leaning back in his Chair, perhaps picking his Teeth, as is uſual, and then another Damſel, much more beautiful than any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, comes unexpectedly into the Room, and ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down by the Knight, begins to inform him what Caſtle that is, and how ſhe is inchanted in it; with many other Particulars, which ſurprize the Knight, and aſtoniſh thoſe that read his Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. I will enlarge no more upon this Matter, ſince from what has been ſaid, it may ſufficiently be inferr'd, that the reading of any Paſſage in any Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Knight-Errantry, muſt be very delightful and ſurprizing to the Reader. And do you, good Sir, believe me, and as I ſaid to you before, read theſe Books, which you may find will baniſh all Melancholy, if you are troubl'd with it, and ſweeten your Diſpoſition if it be harſh. This I can ſay for my ſelf, that ſince my being a Knight-Errant, I am brave, courteous, bountiful, well bred, generous, civil, bold, affable, patient, a Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer of Hardſhips, Impriſonment and Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: And tho' I have ſo lately been ſhut up in a Cage, like a Mad-man, I expect through the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of my Arm, Heaven favouring, and Fortune not oppoſing my Deſigns, to be a King within the compaſs of very few Days, that ſo I may give Proofs of my innate Gratitude and Liberality. For, on my Word, Sir, a poor Man is incapable of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erting his Liberality, tho' he be naturally never ſo well inclin'd. Now that Gratitude which only
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:54446:332"/>
conſiſts in Wiſhes, may be ſaid to be dead, as Faith without good Works is dead. Therefore it is, I wiſh Fortune would ſoon offer ſome Opportunity for me to become an Emperor, that I might give Proofs of my Generoſity, by advancing my Friends, but eſpecially this poor <hi>Sancho Pança</hi> my Squire, who is the harmleſſeſt Fellow in the World; and I would willingly give him an Earldom, which I have long ſince promis'd him, but that I fear he has not Judgment enough to govern his Eſtate.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Sancho</hi> hearing his Maſter's laſt Words; Well, well, Sir, ſaid he, never do you trouble your Head about that Matter; all you have to do is to get me this ſame Earldom, and let me alone to govern it: I can do as my Betters have done before me, I can put in a Deputy, or a Servant, that ſhall take all the Trouble off my Hands, while I, as a Great Man, ſhould loll at my Eaſe, receive my Rents, mind no Buſineſs, live merrily, and ſo let the World rub for <hi>Sancho.</hi> As to the Management of your Revenue, ſaid the Canon, a Deputy or Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, may do well, Friend; but the Lord himſelf is oblig'd to ſtir in the Adminiſtration of Juſtice, to which there is not only a Sufficiency to govern re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd, but a judicious Head alſo to diſtinguiſh nicely, conclude juſtly, and chuſe wiſely. I don't underſtand your Philoſophy, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> all I ſaid, and I'll ſay it again, is, That I wiſh I had as good an Earldom as I cou'd govern; for I have as great a Soul as another Man, and as great a Body as moſt Men: And the firſt thing I wou'd do in my Government, I wou'd have no Body to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul me, I wou'd be abſolute; and who but I: Now, he that's abſolute, can do what he likes; he that can do what he likes, can take his Pleaſure; he that can take his Pleaſure, can be content; and
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:54446:332"/>
he that can be content, has no more to deſire; ſo the Matter's over, and come what will come I'm ſatisfied: If an Iſland, welcome; if no Iſland, fare it well; we ſhall ſee our ſelves in no worſe a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as one blind Man ſaid to another. This is no ill Reaſoning of yours, Friend, ſaid the Canon, tho' there is much more to be ſaid upon this To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick of Earldoms, than you imagine. Undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> but I ſuit my Actions to the Example of <hi>Amadis de Gaul,</hi> who made his Squire <hi>Gandalin</hi> Earl of the Firm-Iſland; which is a fair Precedent for preferring <hi>Sancho</hi> to the ſame Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to which his Merit alſo lays an unqueſtionable Claim. The Canon ſtood amaz'd at Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s methodical and orderly Madneſs: And <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity in ſo eagerly contending for his Earldom, made the whole Company very good Sport.</p>
                           <p>By this Time the Canon's Servants had brought the Proviſion, and ſpreading a Carpet on the Graſs under the ſhady Trees, they ſat down to Dinner; when preſently they heard the Tinkling of a little Bell among the Copſes cloſe by them, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately afterwards they ſaw bolt out of the Thicket a very pretty She-Goat, ſpeckled all over with black, white, and brown Spots, and a Goatherd running after it, who in his familiar Dialect call'd to it to ſtay and return to the Fold; but the Fugitive ran towards the Company frighted and panting, and ſtopt cloſe by them, as if it had begg'd their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. The Goatherd overtaking it, caught it by the Horns, and in a chiding way, as if the Goat underſtood his Reſentments, you little wanton Nanny, ſaid he, you ſpotted Elf, what has made you trip ſo much of late? What Wolf has ſcar'd you thus, Huzzy! Tell me, little Fool, what is the matter? But the Cauſe is plain; thou art a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:54446:333"/>
and therefore never can'ſt be quiet: Curſe on your freakiſh Humours, and all theirs whom you ſo much reſemble; turn back, my Love, turn back, and tho' thou can'ſt not be content with thy Fold, yet there you may be ſafe among the reſt of your Fellows; for if you, that ſhould guide and direct the Flock, love wandring thus, what muſt they do, what will become of them? The Goatherd's Talk to his Goat was entertaining enough to the Company, eſpecially to the Canon, who calling to him, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thee honeſt Fellow, ſaid he, have a little Patience, and let your Goat take its Liberty a while; for, ſince it is a Female, as you ſay, ſhe will follow her natural Inclination the more you would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine it: Come then, and take a Bit, and a Glaſs of Wine with us, you may be better humour'd after that. He then reach'd him the Leg of a cold Rabbet, and ordering him a Glaſs of Wine; the Goat-herd drank it off, and returning the Thanks, was pacify'd. Gentlemen, ſaid he, I wou'd not have you think me a Fool, becauſe I talk ſo ſeriouſly to this ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Animal, for my Words bear a myſterious Meaning; I am indeed, as you ſee, Ruſtick and Unpoliſh'd; tho' not ſo ignorant, but that I can converſe with Men, as well as Brutes. That is no Miracle, ſaid the Curate, for I have known the Woods breed Learned Men, and ſimple Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotts contain Philoſophers. At leaſt, ſaid the Goat-herd, they harbour Men that have ſome Knowledge of the World; and to make good this Truth, if I thought not the Offer impertinent, or my Company troubleſome, you ſhou'd hear an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident which but too well confirms what you have ſaid. For my part, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote.</hi> I will hear you attentively, becauſe methinks your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing has ſomething in it that looks like an Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:54446:333"/>
of Knight-Errantry; and I dare anſwer, the whole Company will not ſo much bring their Parts in queſtion, as to refuſe to hear a Story ſo pleaſing, ſurpriſing and amuſing, as I fancy yours will prove. Then prithee Friend begin, for we will all give you our Attention. You muſt excuſe me for one, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> I muſt have a Word or two in private with this ſame Paſty at you little Brook; for I deſign to fill my Belly for to Morrow and next Day. We Squires of Knight-Errants ſhou'd always lay up for a rainy Day, and when we want Meat, chew the Cud upon what we laid in before hand. You're in the right, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid the Knight; but I have, for my part, ſatisfy'd my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Appetite, and now want only Refreſhment for my Mind, which I hope this honeſt Fellow's Story will afford me. All the Company agreed with Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> the Goatherd then ſtroaking his pretty Goat once or twice; Lie down thou ſpeckl'd Fool, ſaid he, lie by me here; for we ſhall have Time enough to return home. The Creature ſeem'd to underſtand him, for as ſoon as her Maſter ſat down, ſhe ſtretch'd her ſelf quietly by his ſide, and look'd up in his Face, as if ſhe wou'd let him know that ſhe minded what he ſaid; and then he began thus.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. XXIV.</hi> The Goatherd's Tale.</head>
                           <p>ABout three Leagues from this Valley, there is a Village, which tho' ſmall, yet is one of the Richeſt hereabouts. In it there lives a Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in very great Eſteem, and tho' its common for the Rich to be reſpected, yet is this Perſon more conſider'd for the Virtue, than for the Wealth he poſſeſſes. But what he accounted himſelf happieſt in, was a Daughter of ſuch extraordinary Beauty, Prudence, Wit and Virtue, that all who knew or beheld her, cou'd not but admire to ſee how Heaven and Nature had done their utmoſt to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſh her. When ſhe was but little ſhe was Handſome, and as ſhe grew ſhe ſtill grew more Handſome, till at the Age of Sixteen ſhe was moſt compleatly Beautiful. The Fame of her Beauty began to extend to the neighbouring Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages; but why ſay I Villages, it extended to the remoteſt Cities, and enter'd the Palaces of Kings, and the Ears of all manner of Perſons, who from all Parts flock'd to ſee her, as ſomething rare, or as a ſort of Prodigy. Her Father was ſtrictly care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of her, nor was ſhe leſs careful of her ſelf; for there are no Guards, Bolts or Locks, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a young Woman like her own Care and Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion — The Father's Riches and the Daughter's Beauty drew a great many, as well Strangers as Inhabitants of that Country, to ſue for her in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage;
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:54446:334"/>
but ſuch was the vaſt number of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders, as did but the more confound and divide the old Man in his Choice, upon whom to beſtow ſo valuable a Treaſure. Among the Crowd of her Admirers, was I; and good Reaſon I had to hope for Succeſs from the Knowledge her Father had of me, being a Native of the ſame Place, of a good Family, and in the Flower of my Years, of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Eſtate, and not to be deſpis'd for my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. With the very ſame Advantages, there was another Perſon of our Village who made Court to her at the ſame Time. This ſeem'd to hold all Inclination of the Father in ſuſpence, till his Daughter ſhould declare in favour of one of us: To bring this Affair therefore to the ſpeedier Iſſue, he reſolv'd to acquaint <hi>Lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra,</hi> for ſo was this Fair One call'd, that ſince we were Equals in all things, he left her entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly free to chooſe, which of us was moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to herſelf. An Example worthy of being imitated by all Parents, who have any regard for their Children. I don't mean that they ſhou'd be allow'd to chooſe in things Ill or Miſchievous; but only that propoſing to 'em ever thoſe things which are good, they ſhou'd be allow'd in them to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify their Inclination. I don't know how <hi>Leandra</hi> approv'd this Propoſal; this I only know, that her Father put us both off with the excuſe of his Daughter's being too young to be yet diſpos'd of; and that he treated us both in ſuch general Terms, as neither cou'd well pleaſe nor diſpleaſe us— My Rival's Name is <hi>Anſelmo,</hi> mine <hi>Eugenio,</hi> for 'tis neceſſary you ſhou'd know the Names of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons concern'd in this Tragedy, the Concluſion of which, tho' depending, yet may eaſily be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd likewiſe to be unfortunate. About that
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:54446:335"/>
time there came to our Village one <hi>Vicente de la Roſa,</hi> the Son of a poor labouring Man of the Neighbourhood. This <hi>Vicente</hi> came out of <hi>Italy,</hi> having been a Soldier there, and in foreign Parts. He was but a Boy of twelve Years old, when a Captain that happen'd to paſs by here, with his Company, took him out of this Country, and at the end of other twelve Years he return'd hither, habited like a Soldier, all gay and glorious in a thouſand various Colours, bedeck'd with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Toys of Chryſtal, and Chains of Steel. To Day he put on one piece of Finery, to Morrow another; but all falſe, counterfeit and worthleſs. The Country-people, who by Nature are mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and who living in Idleneſs are ſtill more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to Malice, obſerv'd this preſently, and count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his fine things, they found that indeed he had but three Suits of Cloaths, which were of a different colour with the Stockings and Garters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to 'em, yet did he manage 'em with ſo many Tricks and Inventions, that if one had not counted 'em, one wou'd have ſworn he had had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ten Suits, and above twenty Plumes of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.—Let it not ſeem Impertinent that I mention this particular of his Cloaths and Habit, ſince ſo much of the Story depends upon it. Seat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf upon a Bench under a large ſpreading Alder-Tree, which grows in our Street, he us'd to entertain us all with his Exploits, while we ſtood gaping and liſtning at the Wonders he recounted: There was not that Country, as he ſaid, upon the face of the Earth, which he had not ſeen, nor Battle which he had not been engag'd in; he had kill'd more <hi>Moors,</hi> for his own ſhare, than either <hi>Tunis</hi> or <hi>Argier</hi> cou'd hold, and had fought more Duels than <hi>Gante, Luna, Diego Garcia de Paredes,</hi> or
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:54446:335"/>
a thouſand others that he nam'd, yet in all of 'em had the better, and never got a Scratch, or loſt a drop of Blood. Then again he ſhew'd us the Scars of Wounds he had receiv'd, which tho' they were not to be perceiv'd, yet he gave us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand they were ſo many Musket-ſhots, which he had got in ſeveral Skirmiſhes and Rencounters. In ſhort, he treated all his Equals with an unparallel'd Arrogance, and even to thoſe who knew the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Birth, he did not ſtick to affirm, after his manner, that his own Arm was his Father, his Atchievements were his Pedigree, and that, bating his carrying Arms, he was as good a Man as the King.</p>
                           <p>Beſides all theſe Accompliſhments, he was a piece of a Muſitian, and cou'd thrumb a little up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Guitarr; but what his Excellency chiefly lay in, was Poetry; and ſo fond was he of ſhewing his Parts that way, that upon every trifling Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he was ſure to make a Copy of Verſes of a Mile or two in length. This Soldier, whom I have deſcrib'd, this <hi>Vicente de la Roſa,</hi> this Hero, this Gallant, this Muſician, this Poet, was often ſeen and view'd by <hi>Leandra,</hi> from a Window of her Houſe which look'd into the Street; ſhe was ſtruck with the Tinſel of his Dreſs; ſhe was charm'd with his Verſes, of which he took care to diſperſe a great many Copies; her Ears were pleas'd with the Exploits he related of himſelf; and in ſhort, as the Devil wou'd have it, ſhe fell in Love with him before ever he had the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to make his Addreſſes to her: And as in all Affairs of Love, that is the moſt eaſily manag'd, where the Lady's Affection is pre-ingag'd; ſo was it here no hard thing for <hi>Leandra</hi> and <hi>Vicente</hi> to have frequent meetings to concert their Matters;
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:54446:336"/>
and before ever any one of her many Suiters had the leaſt ſurmiſe of her Inclination, ſhe had gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd it; and leaving her Father's Houſe, had run away with this Soldier, who came off with greater Triumph in this Enterpriſe than in any of the reſt he made his boaſts of. The whole Village was ſurpris'd at this accident, as was every one that heard it. I was amaz'd, <hi>Anſelmo</hi> diſtracted, her Father in Tears, her Relations outragious, Juſtice is demanded; a party with Officers is ſent out, who traverſe the Roads, ſearch every Wood, and at the end of three Days find the poor fond <hi>Lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra</hi> in a Cave of one of the Mountains, naked to her Shift, deſpoil'd of all the Money and rich Jewels which ſhe took from home. They bring and preſent her to her Father; upon enquiry made into the cauſe of her Misfortune, ſhe confeſt inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly that <hi>Vicente de la Roſa</hi> had deceiv'd her, and upon promiſe of Marriage had prevail'd with her to leave her Father's Houſe, with the aſſurance of carrying her to the richeſt, but indeed the moſt debauch'd City of the World, which was <hi>Naples;</hi> that ſhe fooliſhly had given credit to him, and robbing her Father, had deliver'd the Treaſure into his Hands the firſt Night; that he carry'd her up a ſteep Mountain, and there confin'd her in that Cave where ſhe was found. In fine, ſhe ſaid, that tho' he had rifl'd her of all ſhe had, yet he had never attempted her Honour; but leaving her in that manner he fled. It was no eaſy matter to make any of us entertain a good opinion of the Soldiers Continence; but ſhe affirm'd it with ſo many repeated Aſſeverations, that in ſome meaſure it ſerv'd to comfort her Father in his Affliction, who valu'd nothing ſo much as his Daughter's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. The very ſame Day that <hi>Leandra</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:54446:336"/>
again, ſhe alſo diſappear'd from us, for her Father immediately clap'd her up in a Monaſtry in a Town not far off, in hopes that Time might wear off ſomething of her Diſgrace. Thoſe who were not intereſted in <hi>Leandra,</hi> excus'd her upon the account of her Youth. But thoſe who were acquainted with her Wit and Senſe, did not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute her Miſcarriage to her Ignorance, but to the Levity and Vanity of Mind natural to Woman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Since the Confinement of <hi>Leandra, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelmo</hi>'s Eyes cou'd never meet with an Object which cou'd give him either Eaſe or Pleaſure; I too cou'd find nothing but what look'd ſad and gloomy to me in the Abſence of <hi>Leandra.</hi> Our Melancholy increas'd, as our Patience de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd: We curſt a thouſand times the Soldier's finery and Trinkets, and rail'd at the Father's want of Precaution: At laſt we agreed, <hi>Anſelmo</hi> and I, to leave the Village, and to retire to this Valley, where he feeding a large flock of Sheep, and I as large a herd of Goats, all our own, we paſs our time under the Trees, giving vent to our Paſſions, ſinging in Conſort the Praiſes or Reproaches of the beauteous <hi>Leandra,</hi> or elſe ſighing alone make our Complaints to Heaven on our Misfortune. In imitation of us, a great many more of <hi>Leandra</hi>'s Lovers have come hither into theſe ſteep and craggy Mountains, and are alike emplov'd; and ſo many there are of 'em, that the Place ſeems to be turn'd to the old <hi>Arcadia</hi> we read of By the top of that Hill there is a number of the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds and their Cottages; there is not a part of it in which is not to be heard the n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

rails at her ill Qualities; in ſhort, all blame, but all adore her: Nay, ſo far does this Humour prevail, that here are thoſe who complain of her Diſdain, who never ſpoke to her; and others who make their boaſts of Favours which ſhe never granted to any; for as I intimated before, her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination was not known before her Diſgrace. There is not a hollow place of a Rock, a Bank of a Brook, or a ſhady Grove, where there is not ſome or other of theſe amorous Shepherds telling their doleful Stories to the Air and Winds. Eccho has learnt to repeat the name of <hi>Leandra, Leandra</hi> all the Hills reſound, the Brooks murmur <hi>Lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra,</hi> and 'tis <hi>Leandra</hi> that holds us all Inchanted, hoping without hope, and fearing without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what we fear. Of all theſe fooliſh People, the Perſon who ſhews the leaſt, and yet has the moſt Senſe, is my Rival <hi>Anſelmo,</hi> who forgetting all other cauſes of Complaint, complains only of her Abſence; and to his Lute, which he touches to Admiration, he joins his Voice in Verſes of his own compoſing, which declare the greatneſs of his Genius. For my part I take another Courſe, I think a better, I'm ſure an eaſier, which is, to ſay all the ill things I can of Womens Levity, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy, their broken Vows and Promiſes, of their Fondneſs of Show and Diſregard of Merit. This, Gentlemen, was the Occaſion of thoſe Words, which at my coming hither I addreſt to this Goat: for being a <hi>ſhe,</hi> I hate her, tho' ſhe is the beſt of my Herd. This is the Story which I promis'd to tell you; if you have thought it too long, I ſhall endeavour to requite your Patience in any thing I can ſerve you. Hard by is my Cottage, where I have ſome good freſh Milk and excellent Cheeſe, with ſeveral ſorts of Fruits,

                              <hi>CHAP. XXV.</hi> Of the Combat between <hi>Don Quixote</hi> and the Goatherd: With the rare Adventure of the Penitents, which the Knight hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily accompliſh'd with the ſweat of his Brows.</head>
                           <p>THE Goatherd's Story was mightily lik'd by the whole Company, eſpecially by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, who particularly minded the manner of his relating it, that had more of a Scholar and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, than of a rude Goatherd; which made him conclude the Curate had reaſon to ſay, that even the Mountains breed Scholars and Men of Senſe. They all made large proffers of their Friendſhip and Service to <hi>Eugenio,</hi> but Don <hi>Quixote</hi> exceeded 'em all, and addreſſing himſelf to him, Were I, ſaid he, at this time in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of undertaking any Adventure, I wou'd cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly begin from this very Moment to ſerve you; I wou'd ſoon releaſe <hi>Leandra</hi> out of the Nunnery, where undoubtedly ſhe is detain'd againſt her will; and in ſpight of all the oppoſition cou'd be made by the Lady Abbeſs and all her Adherents, I wou'd return her to your Hands, that you might have the ſole diſpoſal of her, ſo far, I mean, as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Laws of Knighthood, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:54446:338"/>
forbid that any Man ſhou'd offer the leaſt violence to a Damſel; yet (I truſt in Heaven) that the Power of a friendly Magician will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt the force of a malicious Inchanter; and whenever this ſhall happen, you may aſſure your ſelf of my Favour and Aſſiſtance, to which I am oblig'd by my Profeſſion, that injoins me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Oppreſs'd.</p>
                           <p>The Goatherd, who till then had not taken the leaſt notice of him, now looking earneſtly on him, and finding his diſmal Countenance and wretched Habit were no great incouragement for him to expect a performance of ſuch mighty matters, whiſper'd the Barber who ſate next him. Pray Sir, ſaid he, who is this Man that talks ſo extravagantly? For I proteſt I never ſaw ſo ſtrange a Figure in all my Life. Whom can you imagin it ſhou'd be, reply'd the Barber, but the famous Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> the Eſtabliſher of Juſtice, The Avenger of Injuries, The Protector of Damſels, The Terror of Giants, and the Invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Combats? The account you give of this Perſon, return'd the Goatherd, is much like what we read in <hi>Romances</hi> and Books of Chivalry of thoſe doughty Dons, who for their mighty Proweſs and Atchievements, were call'd Knight-Errants; and therefore I dare ſay you do but jeſt, and that this Gentleman's Brains have deſerted their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                           <p>Thou art an impudent inſolent Varlet, cry'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> 'tis thy Paper-ſcull that is unfit to hold a rational Soul; I have more Brains than the Proſtitute thy Mother had about her when ſhe carry'd thy Lump of Nonſenſe in her Womb. With that, ſnatching up a Loaf that was near him, he ſtruck the Goatherd ſo furious a Blow with
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:54446:338"/>
it, that he almoſt levell'd his Noſe with his Face. T'other not accuſtom'd to ſuch Salutations, no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er perceiv'd how ſcurvily he was treated, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Reſpect to the Table-cloth, Napkins, or to thoſe who were eating, he leap'd furiouſly on Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and taking Hold on his Collar with both his Hands, had certainly ſtrangl'd him, had not <hi>Sancho Pança</hi> come in that very Nick of Time, and griping him faſt behind, thrown him back on the Table, bruiſing Diſhes, breaking Glaſſes, ſpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and overturning all that lay upon it. Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote</hi> ſeeing himſelf freed, fell violently again upon the Goatherd, who, all beſmear'd with Blood, and trampl'd to Pieces under <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Feet, grop'd here and there for ſome Knife or Fork to take a fatal Revenge; but the Canon and Curate took Care to prevent his Purpoſe, and in the mean while, by the Barber's Aſſiſtance, the Goatherd got Don <hi>Quixote</hi> under him, on whom he let fall ſuch a Tempeſt of Blows, as caus'd as great a Shower of Blood to pour from the poor Knight's Face as had ſtream'd from his own. The Canon and Curate were ready to burſt with laughing, the Officers danc'd and jump'd at the Sport, every one cry'd Halloo! as Men uſe to do when two Dogs are ſnarling or fighting; <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho Pança</hi> alone was vex'd, and rav'd becauſe he cou'd not quit himſelf from the ſtrict Embraces of one of the Canon's Servingmen, who kept him from aſſiſting his Maſter. In ſhort, all were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly merry, except the bloody Combatants, who had mawl'd one another moſt miſerably, when on a Sudden they heard the Sound of a Trumpet ſo doleful, that it made 'em turn to liſten towards that Part from whence it ſeem'd to come: But he who was moſt troubl'd at this diſmal Alarm was Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> therefore tho' he lay under the
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:54446:339"/>
Goatherd full ſore againſt his Will, and was moſt lamentably bruis'd and batter'd, Friend Devil, cry'd he to him, (for ſure nothing leſs cou'd have ſo much Valour and Strength as to ſubdue my Forces) let us have a Ceſſation of Arms but for a ſingle Hour, for the dolorous Sound of that Trumpet ſtrikes my Soul with more Horrour, than thy hard Fiſts do my Ears with Pain, and methinks excite me to ſome new Adventure. With that the Goatherd, who was as weary of beating as of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beaten, immediately gave him a Truce; and the Knight once more getting on his Feet, directed his then not haſty Steps to the Place whence the mournful Sound ſeem'd to come, and preſently ſaw a Number of Men all in White, like Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, deſcending from a riſing Ground. The real Matter was this: The People had wanted Rain for a whole Year together, wherefore they appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Rogations, Proceſſions, and Diſciplines through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all that Country, to implore Heaven to open its Treaſury, and ſhow'r down Plenty upon 'em; and to this End the Inhabitants of a Village near that Place came in Proceſſion to a devout Hermitage built on one of the Hills which ſurrounded that Valley.</p>
                           <p>Don <hi>Quixote</hi> taking Notice of the ſtrange Habit of the Penitents, and never reminding himſelf that he had often ſeen the like before, fancy'd immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately it was ſome new Adventure, and he alone was to engage in it, as he was oblig'd by the Laws of Knight-Errantry; and that which the more increas'd his Frenzy, was his miſtaking an Image which they carry'd (all cover'd with Black) for ſome great Lady, whom theſe miſcreant and diſcourteous Knights, he thought, were carrying away againſt her Will. As ſoon as this Whimſy
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:54446:339"/>
took him in the Head, he mov'd with what Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he cou'd towards <hi>Rozinante,</hi> who was feeding up and down upon the Plains and diſmounting his Bridle from the Pummel, and his Target which hung on that, he bridl'd him in an Inſtant; then taking his Sword from <hi>Sancho,</hi> he got in a Trice on <hi>Rozinante</hi>'s Back; where embracing his Target, and addreſſing himſelf aloud to all there preſent, O va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous Company, cry'd he, you ſhall now perceive of how great Importance it is to Mankind, that ſuch illuſtrious Perſons as thoſe who profeſs the Order of Knight-Errantry ſhou'd exiſt in the World; now, I ſay, you ſhall ſee by my freeing that noble Lady, who is there baſely and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly carry'd away Captive, that Knights-Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers ought to be held in the higheſt and greateſt Eſtimation. So ſaying, he ſtruck <hi>Rozinante</hi> with his Heels for want of Spurs; and forcing him to a Hand-gallop (for 'twas never read in any Part of this true Hiſtory that <hi>Rozinante</hi> did ever run full Speed) he poſted to encounter the Penitents, in Spight of all the Curate, Canon, and Barber cou'd do to hinder him; much leſs cou'd <hi>Sancho Pança</hi>'s Outcries detain him, Maſter! Sir! Don <hi>Quixote!</hi> bawl'd out the poor Squire, whither are you poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? are you bewitch'd? does the Devil drive and ſet you on, thus to run againſt the Church? Ah Wretch that I am! — See, Sir! That is a Proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Penitents, and the Lady they carry is the Image of the immaculate Virgin, our bleſſed La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Take Heed what you do, for at this Time it may be certainly ſaid you are out of your Wits—. But <hi>Sancho</hi> might as well have kept his Breath for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother uſe, for the Knight was urg'd with ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a Deſire to encounter the white Men and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe the mourning Lady, that he heard not a Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable

of it, or if he had, he wou'd not have turn'd back at the King's expreſs Command. At laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come near the Proceſſion, and ſtopping <hi>Rozi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nante,</hi> that already had a great Deſire to reſt a little, in a diſmal Tone and with a hoarſe Voice, Ho! cry'd he, you there, who cover your Faces, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps becauſe you are aſham'd of your ſelves, and of the Crime you are now committing, give Heed and Attention to what I have to ſay! — The firſt who ſtopt at this Alarm were thoſe who carry'd the Image; when one of the four Prieſts that ſung the Litanies, ſeeing the ſtrange Figure that Don <hi>Quixote</hi> made, and the Leanneſs of <hi>Rozinante,</hi> with other Circumſtances which he obſerv'd in the Knight ſufficient to have forc'd Laughter, preſently made him this Anſwer; Good Sir! if you have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to ſay to us ſpeak it quickly; for theſe poor Men whom you ſee are very much tir'd, therefore we neither can, nor is it reaſonable we ſhou'd, ſtand thus in Pain to hear any thing that can't be deliver'd in two Words. I will ſay it in one, reply'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> which is this; I charge you immediately to releaſe that beautiful Lady, whoſe Tears and Looks full of Sorrow evidently ſhew you carry her away by Violence, and have done her ſome unheard of Injury. This do, or I who was born to puniſh ſuch Outrages, will not ſuffer you to advance one Step with her, till ſhe is entirely poſſeſs'd of that Liberty ſhe ſo earneſtly deſires and ſo juſtly deſerves. This laſt Speech made 'em all conclude that the Knight was certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtracted, and caus'd a general Laughter: But this prov'd like Oil to Fire, and ſo inflam'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> that laying his Hand on his Sword, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more Words, he preſently aſſaulted thoſe who carry'd the Image. At the ſame Time one of them
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:54446:340"/>
quitting his Poſt, came to encounter our Heroe with a wooden Fork, on which he ſupported the Bier whenever they made a Stand, and warding with it a weighty Blow which Don <hi>Quixote</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd and diſcharg'd at him, the Fork was cleft in two; but he who had the remaining Piece in his Hand return'd the Knight ſuch a Thwack on his left Shoulder, that his Target not being able to reſiſt ſuch ruſtick Force, the poor unfortunate Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was ſtruck to the Ground and miſerably bruis'd.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Sancho Pança,</hi> who had follow'd him as faſt as his Breath and Legs wou'd permit, ſeeing him fall, cry'd out to his Adverſary to forbear ſtriking him, urging that he was a poor enchanted Knight, and one who in his whole Life had never done any Man Harm. But 'twas not <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Arguments that held the Country-fellow's Hands, the only Motive was, that he fear'd he had kill'd him, ſince he cou'd not perceive he ſtirr'd either Hand or Foot; wherefore tucking his Coat up to his Girdle with all poſſible Expedition, he ſcour'd over the Fields like a Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hound. Mean while Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Companions haſten'd to the Place where he lay, and thoſe of the Proceſſion, who ſaw 'em come running towards them, attended by the Officers of the Holy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood with their Croſs-bows, began to have Apprehenſions of ſome ill Deſign againſt 'em from the approaching Party; wherefore drawing up in a Body about the Image, the Diſciplinants lifting up their Hoods, and graſping faſt their Whips, as the Prieſts did their Tapers, they expected the Aſſault with the greateſt Bravery, reſolving to defend themſelves and offend their Enemy as long and as much as poſſible: But Providence had order'd the Matter much better than they cou'd hope; for
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:54446:341"/>
while <hi>Sancho</hi> who had thrown himſelf on his Maſter's Body was lamenting his Loſs, and the ſuppos'd Death of ſo noble and generous a Lord, in the moſt ridiculous Manner that e'er was heard, the Curate of the Knight's Party was come up with the other who came in the Proceſſion, and was immediately known by him, ſo that their Acquaintance put an End to the Fears which both Sides were in of an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement. Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Curate in few Words ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the other with the Knight's Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; whereupon he and the whole Squadron of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents went over to ſee whether the unfortunate Knight were living or dead, and heard <hi>Sancho Pança</hi> with Tears in his Eyes bewailing over his Maſter: O Flower of Knighthood, cry'd he, that with one ſingle perlous Knock art come to an untimely End! Thou Honour of thy Family, and Glory of all <hi>La Mancha!</hi> nay, and of the whole varſal World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; which, now it has loſt thee, will be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run by Miſcreants and Outlaws, who will no longer be afraid to be mauld for their Miſdeeds. O bountiful above all the <hi>Alexanders</hi> in the World! thou who haſt rewarded me but for poor eight Months Service with the beſt Iſland that is waſh'd by Salt Water! Thou who wert humble to the Proud and haughty to the Humble! Thou who durſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake Perils, and patiently endure Affronts! Thou who wert in Love, no Body knows why! True Pattern of good Men, and Scourge of the wicked, ſworn Foe to all Reprobates! and to ſay all at once that Man can ſay, thou Knight-Errant!</p>
                           <p>The woful Accents of the Squire's Voice at laſt recall'd Don <hi>Quixote</hi> to himſelf; when after a deep Sigh, the firſt thing he thought of was his abſent <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> O charming <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> cry'd he, the Wretch that lingers baniſh'd from your ſight
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:54446:341"/>
indures far greater Miſeries than this! And then looking on his faithful Squire, Good <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid he, help me once more into the Inchanted Chariot; for I am not in a condition to mount at preſent; this Shoulder is all broke to pieces. With all my heart, my good Lord, reply'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> and pray let me adviſe you to go back to our Village with thoſe Gentlemen who are your ſpecial Friends. At home we may think of ſome other Journey that may be more to the purpoſe than this. With reaſon haſt thou ſpoken, <hi>Sancho,</hi> reply'd Don <hi>Quixote:</hi> It will become our Wiſdom to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active till the malevolent Aſpects of the Planets which now reign be over. This grave Reſolution was highly commended by the Canon, Curate, and Barber, who had been ſufficiently diverted by <hi>Sancho Pança</hi>'s ridiculous Lamentation. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was plac'd in the Waggon as before, The Proceſſioners recover'd their former Order, and paſt on about their Buſineſs. The Goatherd took his leave of the whole Company. The Curate ſatisfy'd the Officers for their Attendance, ſince they would ſtir no farther. The Canon deſir'd the Curate to ſend him an account of Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Condition from that time forward, having a mind to know whether his Phrenzy abated or increas'd; and then took his leave to continue his Journy. Thus the Curate, the Barber, Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and <hi>Sancho Pança</hi> were left together; as alſo the good <hi>Rozinante,</hi> that bore all theſe Paſſages as patiently as his Maſter. The Waggoner then yoak'd his Oxen, and having ſet Don <hi>Quixote</hi> on a Truſs of Hay, jogg'd on after his ſlow accuſtom'd pace that way the Curate had directed. In ſix days time they reach'd the Knight's Village: 'Twas about noon when they enter'd the Town; and as
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:54446:342"/>
this happen'd to be on a Sunday, all the People were in the Market-place, thro the middle of which Don <hi>Quixote's</hi> Cart muſt of neceſſity paſs. Every body was curious to know what was in it; and the People were ſtrangely ſurpriz'd when they ſaw and knew their Townſman. While they were gaping and wondering, a little Boy ran to the Knight's Houſe, and gave intelligence to the Houſe-keeper and Niece, that their Maſter was return'd, and very lean, pale, and frightful as a Ghoſt, ſtretch'd out at length on a Bundle of Hay in a Waggon, and drawn along by a Team of Oxen.</p>
                           <p>'Twas a piteous Sight to ſee the wailing of thoſe two poor Creatures; the Blows too which they gave themſelves, with the Curſes and Execrations they thunder'd out againſt all Books of Chivalry, were almoſt as numerous as their Sighs and Tears: But the heighth of their lamenting was when Don <hi>Quixote</hi> entr'd the Door. Upon the noiſe of his Arrival <hi>Sancho Pança</hi>'s Wife made haſte thither to inquire after her good Man, who, ſhe was inform'd, went a Squiring with the Knight. As ſoon as ever ſhe ſet Eyes on him, the queſtion ſhe ask'd him was this: Is the Aſs in health, or no? <hi>Sancho</hi> anſwer'd, he was come back in better health than his Maſter Well, ſaid ſhe, Heaven be prais'd for the good News. But hark you, my Friend! con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd ſhe; what have you got by this new Squire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? Have you brought me home e'er a Gown or Petticoat, or Shooes for my little Boys? In troth, ſweet Wife, reply'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> I have brought thee none of theſe things; I am loaded with better things. Ay? ſaid his Wife, that's well; Prethee let me ſee ſome of them fine things; for I vow I've a hugeous mind to ſhe 'em; the ſight of 'em
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:54446:342"/>
will comfort my poor Heart, which has been like to burſt with Sorrow and Grief ever ſince you went away. I'll ſhew 'em thee when we come home, return'd <hi>Sancho;</hi> in the mean time reſt ſatsfy'd; for, if Heaven ſee good that we ſhall once again come abroad in ſearch of other Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, within a little time after, at my return, thou ſhalt find me ſome Earl, or the Governour of ſome Iſland; ay, of one of the very beſt in the whole World. I wiſh with all my heart this may come to paſs, reply'd the good Wife; for, by my troth, Husband, we want it ſorely. But what do you mean by that ſame word Iſlands? for believe me I don't underſtand it. All in good time, Wife, ſaid <hi>Sancho;</hi> Honey is not made for an Aſſe's Mouth: I'll tell thee what 'tis hereafter. Thou wilt be amaz'd to hear all thy Servants and Vaſſals ne'er ſpeak a word to thee without an't pleaſe you Madam, an't like your Ladyſhip, and your Honour. What doſt thou mean, <hi>Sancho,</hi> by Ladyſhip, Iſlands, and Vaſſals, ask'd <hi>Joan Pança?</hi> For ſo ſhe was call'd, tho her Husband and ſhe were nothing a-kin, only 'tis a Cuſtom in <hi>La Mancha</hi> that the Wives are there call'd by their Husbands Sirnames. Prithee <hi>Joan,</hi> ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> dont't trouble thy head to know theſe Matters all at once, and in a heap, as a body may ſay. Yet, by the way, one thing I will aſſure thee, That nothing in the varſal World is better for an honeſt Man, than to be Squire to a Knight-Errant while he's hunting of Adventures. 'Tis true, moſt Adventures he goes about do not anſwer a Man's Expectation ſo much as he cou'd wiſh; for of a hundred that are met with, ninety and nine are wont to be crabbed and unlucky ones. This I know to my coſt: I my ſelf have got well kick'd and toſs'd in ſome of 'em,
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:54446:343"/>
and ſoundly drub'd and belabour'd in others; yet, for all that, 'tis rare ſport to be a watching for ſtrange Chances, to croſs Foreſts, to ſearch and beat up and down in Woods, to ſcramble over Rocks, to viſit Caſtles, and take up Quarters in an Inn at pleaſure, and all the while the Devil a Croſs to pay.</p>
                           <p>Theſe were the Diſcourſes with which <hi>Sancho Pança</hi> and his Wife <hi>Joan</hi> entertain'd one another, while the Houſe-keeper and Niece undreſt Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and put him into his Bed; where he lay looking very earneſtly on 'em, but cou'd not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin where he was. The Curate charg'd the Niece to be very careful and tender of her Uncle, and to be very watchful, leſt he ſhou'd make a third Sally; telling 'em what difficulty he had to get him home again. Here the Women began their Out-crys again: Here the Books of Knight-Errantry were again execrated and damn'd to the bottomleſs Pit. Here they beg'd thoſe curſed bewitching <hi>Chimeras</hi> and Lies might be thrown down into the very Centre, to the Helliſh Father of 'em: For, they were ſtill almoſt diſtracted with the fear of loſing their Maſter and Uncle afreſh, immediately upon his Recovery; which indeed ſucceeded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Fear. But, tho the Author of this Hiſtory has been very curious and diligent in his inquiry after Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Atchievements in his third Expedition in queſt of Adventures, yet he cou'd never learn a perfect account of 'em, at leaſt from any Author of Credit. Fame and Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alone have preſerv'd ſome particulars of 'em in the Memoirs of ſeveral Inhabitants of <hi>La Mancha;</hi> as, that after the Knight's third Sally, he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at certain famous Tilts and Tournaments made in the City of <hi>Saragoſa,</hi> where he met with
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:54446:343"/>
Occaſions worthy the exerciſe of his Senſe and Valour: But how the Knight dy'd, our Author neither cou'd nor ever ſhou'd have learn'd, if by good Fortune he had not met with an antient Phyſician, who had a Leaden Box in his poſſeſſion, which, as he aſſur'd me, was found in the Ruins of an old Hermitage, as it was rebuilding. In this Box were certain Scrolls of Parchment written in <hi>Gothic</hi> Characters, but containing Verſes in the Spaniſh Tongue, in which many of his noble Acts were ſung, and <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo</hi>'s Beauty cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, <hi>Rozinante</hi>'s Figure deſcrib'd, and <hi>Sancho Pança</hi>'s Fidelity applauded. They likewiſe gave an account of Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Sepulchre, with ſeveral Epitaphs and Elogies on his Life and Manners. Thoſe that cou'd be thorowly read and tranſcrib'd, are here added by the faithful Author of this New and Incomparable Hiſtory; deſiring no other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe or Reward of the Readers for all his Labour and Pains in ſearching all the large and old Records of <hi>La Mancha</hi> to perfect this matchleſs Piece, but that they will be pleas'd to give it as much credit as judicious Men uſe to give to Books of Knight-Errantry, which are now a days are ſo generally taking. This is the utmoſt of his Ambition, and will be his Satisfaction, and will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe incourage him to furniſh 'em with other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Entertainment; which, tho poſſibly not altogether ſo true as this, yet it may be as fancyful and diverting. The firſt Words in the Parchment found in the Leaden Box are theſe:</p>

                     <p>'TIS a Hardſhip that I am deſtitute of other Means to acknowledge my Obligations, than by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding the Forfeiture of my Pretences to your Favour; and that I am forced to repay your Acts of Generoſity in this manner, by an Impoſition on your Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity: But the Muſes are of that Sex, which, if once obliged, think they have a Right ſtill to perſecute their Benefactor.</p>
                     <p>The Encouragement You are pleas'd to give my Attempt upon <hi>Don Quixote</hi> was one great Motive to my Proſecution of the Deſign; and, to crown my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours with a Succeſs anſwerable, I muſt beg you to Patronize what you ſo generouſly promoted. But abating theſe Apologies for my Preſumption, I have
<pb facs="tcp:54446:347"/>
one unanſwerable Plea, as I am a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator: I muſt do my Author Juſtice; and if I have learn'd any thing of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the Writer, by examining his Work, the Great <hi>Cervantes,</hi> were he now alive, would have laid the Original where I depoſite the Copy: He would have choſen a Perſon, whoſe Illuſtrious Birth might blazon his Book with Honour, whoſe Knowledge in polite Learning might ſilence the Tongues of Criticiſm, and whoſe Perſonal Vertues might ſtop even the Mouth of Envy. He would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have call'd for Protection to ſome Influence ſuperior to his own; and where could the Great <hi>Cervantes</hi> find it, but in the Name of <hi>BOYLE,</hi> a Name that Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, Poetry and Literature have dreſs'd with all their Charms, that the World might know it for their Darling! I need nor, Sir, particularize the Branches of your Illuſtrious Houſe that are digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd that way. Fame has them upon Record, and they may be found in all the private Studies of <hi>England,</hi> all the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Libraries in <hi>Europe;</hi> but moſt of all, Sir, in your Self.</p>
                     <p>'Tis a Reflection, Sir, upon Epiſtles Dedicatory, that all Writers addreſs their
<pb facs="tcp:54446:347"/>
Patrons much after the ſame manner: But Men ſhould conſider that there is a Tranſmigration of Vertue from one Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Perſon to another, and that whatever has been ſaid of <hi>Maecenas,</hi> ſhould for the ſame Reaſon be ſaid of You. His Capacity for arduous Affairs was high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evident, from his great Share in the Management of Publick Buſineſs. Your Employments in the State, with Your Aſſiduity in the Senate, make you an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament to your Station, and a Benefit to your Country. He was famous for his countenancing of Parts and Learning, and you are no leſs eminent for your Encouragement of Arts and Ingenuity. The Subject of our Praiſe is the ſame, the <hi>Roman</hi> is every way here, but there wants a <hi>Virgil</hi> or a <hi>Horace</hi> to make the Parallel compleat. Had I the Spirit of the Poet, as you have the Qualifications of the Patron, I would with leſs Bluſhing, and more Aſſurance, have ventur'd to own my ſelf,</p>

                        <hi>THE</hi> Author's PREFACE.</head>
                     <p>BLeſs me! Reader, gentle or ſimple, or whatever you be, how impatiently by this time muſt you expect this Preface, ſuppoſing it to be nothing but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful Invectives againſt the Author of the<note n="*" place="bottom">A Perſon who wrote himſelf a Native of <hi>Torde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillas,</hi> Publiſhed an Impertinent Book by that Name, Printed at <hi>Tarragona,</hi> while our Author was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his ſecond Part for the Preſs.</note> 
                        <hi>ſecond</hi> Don <hi>Quixote.</hi> But I muſt beg your Pardon; for I ſhall ſay no more of him than every body ſays, that <hi>Tordeſillas</hi> is the Place where he was begotten, and <hi>Tarragona</hi> the Place where he was Born; and thought it be univerſally ſaid, that even a Worm, when trod upon, will turn again, yet I'm reſolv'd for once to croſs the Proverb. You perhaps now would have me call him Coxcomb, Fool, and Mad-man; but I'm of another Mind; and ſo let his Folly be its own Puniſhment. But there is ſomething which I cannot ſo ſilently paſs over: He is pleas'd to upbraid me with my Age: Indeed had it been in the Power of
<pb facs="tcp:54446:348"/>
Man to ſtop the Career of Time, I would not have ſuffer'd the Old Gentleman to have laid his Fingers on me. Then he reflectingly tells me of the Loſs of one of my Hands; as if that Maim had been got in a ſcandalous or drunken Quarrel in ſome Tavern, and not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the moſt memorable<note n="*" place="bottom">The Battle of <hi>Lepanto.</hi>
                        </note> Occaſion that either paſt, or preſent Ages have beheld, and which perhaps Futurity will never parallel. If my Wounds do not redound to my Honour in the thoughts of ſome of thoſe that look upon 'em, they will at leaſt ſecure me the Eſteem of thoſe that know how they were gotten. A Soldier makes a nobler Figure as he lies Bleeding in the Bed of Honour, than in an Inglorious Flight; and I am ſo far from being aſham'd of the loſs of my Hand, that were it poſſible to recall the ſame Opportunity, I ſhou'd think my Wounds but a ſmall Price for the Glory of ſharing in that Prodigious Action. The Scars in a Soldier's Face and Breaſt, are the Stars that by a Laudable Imitation guide others to the Port of Honour and Glory. Beſides, it is not the Hand, but the Underſtanding of a Man, that may be ſaid to Write; and thoſe Years that he is pleas'd to quarrel with, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways improve the latter.</p>
                     <p>I am not wholly inſenſible of his Epithets of Ignorant and Envious; but I take Heaven to Witneſs, I never was acquainted with any
<pb facs="tcp:54446:349"/>
Branch of Envy beyond a ſacred, generous, and ingenuous Emulation, which could never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage me to abuſe a Clergy-man, eſpecially if made the more Reverend by a Poſt in the Inquiſition: And if any ſuch Perſon thinks himſelf affronted, as that Author ſeems to hint, he is mightily miſtaken; for I have a Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for his Parts, admire his Works, and have an awful Regard for the Efficacious Virtue of his Office.</p>
                     <p>I muſt return this fine Dogmatical Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man my hearty Thanks for his Criticiſm up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Novels: He is pleas'd very Judiciouſly to ſay, that they have more of Satyr than of Morality; and yet owns that the Novels are good. Now I thought that if a Thing was good, it muſt be ſo in every reſpect.</p>
                     <p>Methinks, Reader, I hear you blame me for ſhewing ſo little Reſentment, and uſing him ſo gently; but pray conſider, 'tis not good to bear too hard upon a Man that is ſo over-modeſt, and ſo much in Affliction; for certainly this muſt needs be a Miſerable Soul: He has not the Face, poor Man, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in Publick; but, conſcious of his wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Circumſtances, conceals his Name, and counterfeits his Country, as if he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Treaſon, or ſome other puniſhable Crime: Well then, if ever you ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to fall into his Company, pray in Pity tell him from me, that I have not the leaſt Quarrel in the World with him: For I am not Ignorant of the Temptations of <hi>Satan;</hi> and of all his
<pb facs="tcp:54446:349"/>
Imps, the Scribbling Devil is the moſt Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible. When that Demon is got into a Man's Head, he takes the Poſſeſſion for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, and full of his falſe Ability, falls <hi>ſlap daſh</hi> to Writing and Publiſhing, which gets him as much Fame from the World, as he has Money from the Bookſellers, and as little Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from the Bookſellers as he has Fame from the World. But if he won't believe what you ſay, and you be diſpos'd to be merry, pray tell him this Story.</p>
                     <p>Once upon a time, there was a Mad-man in <hi>Sevil</hi> that hit upon one of the prettieſt out-of-the-way Whims that ever Mad-man in this World was Poſſeſs'd withal. He gets him a hollow Cane, ſmall at one end, and catching hold of a Dog in the Street, or any where elſe, he clapp'd his Foot on one of the Cur's Legs, and holding up his Hind-Leg in his Hand, he fitted his Cane to the Dog's Back-ſide, and blew him up as round as a Ball; then giving him a Thump or two on the Guts, and turning to the By-ſtanders, who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a great many upon ſuch Occaſions: Well, Gentlemen, ſaid he, What do you think? Is it ſuch an eaſe Matter to blow up a Dog? And what think you, Sir, Is it ſuch an eaſie matter to Write a Book? But if this Picture be not like him, pray, Honeſt Reader, tell him this other Story of a Dog and a Mad-man.</p>
                     <p>There was a Mad-man at <hi>Cordova,</hi> who made it his Buſineſs to carry about the Streets up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:54446:350"/>
his Head a huge Stone of a pretty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable Weight; and whenever he met with a Dog without a Maſter, eſpecially ſuch a ſurly Cur as would ſtalk up to his Noſe, he very fairly dropp'd his Load all at once, ſouſe, upon him: The poor Beaſt would howl, and growl, and clapping his Tail between his Legs, limp'd away without ſo much as looking behind him, for two or three Streets length at leaſt. The Mad-man, mightily pleas'd with his new De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, ſerv'd every Dog that had Courage to look him in the Face, with the ſame Sauce; till one Day it was his Fortune to meet with a Sportſman's Dog, a Capmaker's by Trade, though that's neither here nor there. The Dog was mightily valu'd by his Maſter, but that was more than the Mad-man knew; for <hi>ſlap</hi> went the Stone upon the poor Dog. The Animal being almoſt cruſh'd to Death, ſet up his Throat, and yelp'd moſt piteouſly; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that his Maſter knowing 'twas his Dog by the Howl, runs out, and touch'd with the Injury, whips up a Stick that was at Hand, lets drive at the Mad-man, and belabours him to ſome Purpoſe, crying out at every Blow, you Son of a Bitch, abuſe my Spaniel! You Inhumane Raſcal, did not you know that my Dog was a Spaniel? And ſo thwack'd the poor Lunatick, till he had not a whole Bone in his Skin. At laſt he crawl'd from under his Clutches, and it was a whole Month before he could lick himſelf whole again. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, out he came once more with his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
<pb facs="tcp:54446:350"/>
and heavier it was than the former; but coming by the ſame Dog again, though he had Month's Mind to give him t'other Dab; yet recollecting himſelf, and ſhrugging up his Shoulders: No, quoth he, I muſt have a care, this Dog's a Spaniel. In ſhort, all Dogs he met, whether Maſtiffs or Hounds, were down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Spaniels to him ever after. Now the Moral of the Fable is this, this Author's Wit is the Mad-man's Stone, and 'tis likely he will be cautious how he lets it fall for the future.</p>
                     <p>One Word more, and I have done with him. Pray tell the mighty Man, That as to his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces of taking the Bread out of my Mouth, I ſhall only Anſwer him with a piece of an Old Song, <hi>God Proſper long our Noble King, our Lives and Safeties all,</hi>— and ſo Peace be with him. Long live the great <hi>Conde de Lemos,</hi> whoſe Humanity, and celebrated Liberality ſuſtain me under the moſt ſevere Blows of Fortune! And may the eminent Charity of the Cardinal of <hi>Toledo,</hi> make an Eternal Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his Fame! Had I never Publiſh'd a Word, and were as many Books Publiſh'd againſt me, as there are Letters in <hi>Mingo Revulgo</hi>'s Poems; yet the Bounty of theſe two Princes that has taken Charge of me, without any Solliciting, or Adulation, were ſufficient in my Favour: And I think my ſelf Richer and Greater in their Eſteem, than I would of any Profitable Honour that can be Purchas'd at the ordinary rate of Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb facs="tcp:54446:351"/>
The Indigent Man may attain their Favour, but the Vicious cannot. Poverty may partly Eclipſe a Gentleman, but cannot to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally Obſcure him; and thoſe Glimmerings of Ingenuity that peep through the Chinks of a narrow Fortune, have always gain'd the Eſteem of the truly Noble and Generous Spirits.</p>
                     <p>Now, Reader, I have done with him and you, only give me leave to tell you, that this ſecond Part of Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> which I now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent you, is cut by the ſame Hand, and of the ſame Piece with the firſt. Here you have the Knight once more fitted out, and at laſt brought to his Death, and fairly laid in his Grave; that no Body may preſume to raiſe any more Stories of him. He has committed Extravagancies enough already, he's ſorry for't, and that's enough. Too much of one thing clogs the Appetite, but Scarcity makes every thing go down.</p>
                     <p>I forgot to tell you, that my <hi>Perſiles</hi> is almoſt finiſh'd, and expects to kiſs your Hands in a little time, and the ſecond Part of the <hi>Galatea</hi> will ſhortly put in for the ſame Honour.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>CID HAMET Benengeli</hi> relates in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Part of this Hiſtory, and Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s third Salley, that the Curate and the Barber were almoſt a whole Month without giving him
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:54446:352"/>
a Viſit; leſt calling to mind his former Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies, he might take occaſion to renew 'em. However, they fail'd not every Day to ſee his Niece, and his Houſe-keeper, whom they charg'd to treat and cheriſh him with great Care, and to give him ſuch Diet as might be moſt proper to chear his Heart, and comfort his Brain, whence in all likelyhood his Diſorder wholly proceeded. They anſwered, that they did ſo, and would continue it to their utmoſt power; the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they obſerv'd, that ſometimes he ſeem'd to be in his right Senſes. This News was very welcome to the Curate and the Barber, who look'd on this Amendment as an Effect of their contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, in bringing him home in the Inchanted Waggon, as 'tis Recorded in the laſt Chapter of the firſt Part of this moſt important, and no leſs punctual Hiſtory. Thereupon they reſolv'd to give him a Viſit, and make tryal themſelves of the progreſs of a Cure, which they thought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt impoſſible. They alſo agreed not to ſpeak a Word of Knight-Errantry, leſt they ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger a Wound ſo lately clos'd and ſo tender. In ſhort, they went to ſee him, and found him ſitting up in his Bed in a Waſte-coat of green Bays, and a red <hi>Toledo</hi>-Cap on his Head: But the poor Gentleman was ſo wither'd and waſted, that he look'd like a meer Mummy. He receiv'd 'em very civilly, and when they enquir'd of his Health, gave 'em an account of his Condition, expreſſing himſelf very handſomly, and with a great deal of Judgment. After they had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd a while of ſeveral Matters, they fell at laſt on State-Affairs and Forms of Government, Correcting this Grievance, and Condemning that, Reforming one Cuſtom, Rejecting another, and Eſtabliſhing new Laws, as if they had been the
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:54446:352"/>
                           <hi>Lycurgus</hi>'s or <hi>Solon</hi>'s of the Age; till they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd and new modell'd the Common-wealth at ſuch a rate, that they ſeem'd to have clapp'd it into a Forge, and drawn it out wholly different from what it was before. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> reaſon'd with ſo much Diſcretion on every Subject, that his two Viſitants now undoubtedly believ'd him in his right Senſes.</p>
                        <p>His Niece and Houſe-keeper were preſent at theſe Diſcourſes; and hearing him give ſo many marks of a ſound Underſtanding, thought they could never return Heaven ſufficient thanks, for ſo extraordinary a Bleſſing. But the Curate, who wonder'd at this ſtrange amendment, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to try whether Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was perfectly recover'd, thought fit to alter the Reſolution he had taken to avoid entering into any Diſcourſe of Knight-Errantry; and therefore began to talk to him of News, and among the reſt, that it was credibly reported at Court, that the Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior was advancing with a vaſt Army, and no Body knew where the Tempeſt would fall; that all Chriſtendom was alarm'd, as it us'd to be almoſt every Year; and that the King was providing for the Security of the Coaſts of <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> and the Iſland of <hi>Malta.</hi> His Majeſty, ſaid Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote,</hi> acts the part of a moſt prudent Warriour, in putting his Dominions betimes in a Poſture of Defence; for by that Precaution he prevents the ſurprizes of the Enemy: But yet if my Counſel were to be taken in this Matter, I would adviſe another ſort of Preparation which I fancy his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty little thinks of at preſent. Now Heaven aſſiſt thee, poor Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> (ſaid the Curate to himſelf, hearing this) I am afraid thou art now tumbling from the top of thy Madneſs, to the very bottom of Simplicity. Thereupon the Barber,
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:54446:353"/>
who had preſently made the ſame Reflection, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd Don <hi>Quixote</hi> to Communicate to 'em this mighty Project of his; for, ſaid he, who knows but after all, it may be one of thoſe that are only to find a Place in the Liſt of impertinent Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions uſually given to Princes. No, good Mr. Trimmer, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> my Project is not impertinent, but highly adviſeable. I meant no harm in what I ſaid, Sir, reply'd the Barber, only we generally find, moſt of theſe Projects that are offer'd to the King, are either Impracticable or Whimſical, or tend to the detriment of the King or Kingdom. But mine, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impoſſible nor Ridiculous; far from that, 'tis the moſt eaſie, the moſt thoroughly weigh'd, and the moſt conciſe, that ever can be devis'd by Man. Methinks you are too long before you let us know it, Sir, ſaid the Curate. To deal freely with you, reply'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> I ſhould be loath to tell it you here now, and have it reach the Ear of ſome Privy-Counſellor to morrow, and ſo afterwards ſee the fruit of my Invention reap'd by ſome Body elſe. As for me, ſaid the Barber, I give you my Word here, and in the Face of Heaven, never to tell it, either to King, Queen, Rook, Pawn, or Knight, or any earthly Man: An Oath I learn'd out of the Romance of the Curate, in the Preface to which he tells the King who it was that Robb'd him of his hundred Doublons, and his Ambling Mule. I know nothing of the Story, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> but I have reaſon to be ſatisfied with the Oath, becauſe I'm confident Maſter Barber is an honeſt Man. Tho' he were not, ſaid the Curate, I'll be his Surety in this matter, and will engage for him, that he ſhall no more ſpeak of it, than if he were dumb, under what Penalty you pleaſe. And who ſhall anſwer for you, Mr. Curate, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:54446:353"/>
Don <hi>Quixote?</hi> My Profeſſion, reply'd the Curate, which binds me to Secrecy. Body of me then! cry'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> what has the King to do more but to cauſe publick Proclamation to be made, enjoyning all the Knight-Errants that are diſpers'd in this Kingdom, to make their Perſonal appearance at Court upon a certain Day. For though but half a dozen ſhould meet, there may be ſome one among 'em, who even alone might be able to deſtroy the whole united Force of <hi>Turkey.</hi> For pray obſerve well what I ſay, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and take me along with ye. Do you look upon it as a new thing for one Knight-Errant alone to Rout an Army of two hundred thouſand Men, with as much eaſe as if all of 'em joyn'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether had but one Throat, or were made of Sugar-paſte? You know how many Hiſtories are full of theſe Wonders. Were but the Renown'd Don <hi>Bellianis</hi> living now, with a Vengeance on me, (for I'll Curſe no Body elſe) or ſome Knight of the innumerable Race of <hi>Amadis de Gaul,</hi> and he met with theſe <hi>Turks,</hi> what a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> woeful Condition would they be in! However, I hope Providence will in Pity look down upon his People, and raiſe up, if not ſo prevalent a Champion as thoſe of former Ages, at leaſt, ſome one who may perhaps rival them in Courage; Heaven knows my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; I ſay no more. Alas! ſaid the Niece, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, I'll lay my Life, my Uncle has ſtill a han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kering after Knight-Errantry. I will die a Knight-Errant, cry'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and ſo let the <hi>Turks</hi> Land where they pleaſe, how they pleaſe, and when they pleaſe, and with all the Forces they can Muſter; once more I ſay, Heaven knows my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Gentlemen, ſaid the Barber, I beg leave to tell you a ſhort Story of ſomewhat that happen'd at <hi>Sevil:</hi> Indeed it falls out as pat as if it had
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:54446:354"/>
been made for our preſent purpoſe, and ſo I have a great mind to tell it. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> gave Conſent, the Curate and the reſt of the Company were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to hear; and thus the Barber began.</p>
                        <p>A certain Perſon being Diſtracted, was put into the Mad-houſe at <hi>Sevil</hi> by his Relations. He had Studied the Civil-Law, and taken his Degrees at <hi>Oſſuna;</hi> though, had he taken 'em at <hi>Salamanca,</hi> many are of opinion he would have been mad too. After he had liv'd ſome Years in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, he was pleas'd to fancy himſelf in his right Senſes, and upon this conceit wrote to the Archbiſhop, beſeeching him with great earneſtneſs, and all the colour of Reaſon imaginable, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe him out of his Miſery by his Authority, ſince by the Mercy of Heaven he was wholly freed from any diſorder in his Mind; only his Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he ſaid, kept him in ſtill to enjoy his Eſtate, and deſign'd, in ſpight of Truth, to have him Mad to his dying Day. The Archbiſhop, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by many Letters, which he wrote to him on that Subject, all Penn'd with Senſe and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, order'd one of his Chaplains to enquire of the Governour of the Houſe into the truth of the matter, and alſo to Diſcourſe with the Party, that he might ſet him at large, in caſe he found him free from Diſtraction. Thereupon the Chaplain went, and having ask'd the Governor what condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Graduate was in? Was anſwer'd, that he was ſtill Mad, that ſometimes indeed he would talk like a Man of excellent Senſe, but preſently after he would relapſe into his former Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies, which at leaſt ballanc'd all his rational Talk, as he himſelf might find, if he pleas'd to Diſcourſe him. The Chaplain being reſolv'd to make the Experiment, went to the Mad-man, and convers'd with him above an Hour, and in all
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:54446:354"/>
that time could not perceive the leaſt diſorder in his Brain; far from that, he deliver'd himſelf with ſo much ſedateneſs, and gave ſuch direct and pertinent Anſwers to every Queſtion, that the Chaplain was oblig'd to believe him ſound in his Underſtanding; nay, he went ſo far, as to make a plauſible Complaint againſt his Keeper, alledging, that, for the lucre of thoſe Preſents which his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations ſent him, he repreſented him to thoſe who came to ſee him, as one who was ſtill diſtracted, and had only now and then lucid Intervals; but that after all, his greateſt Enemy was his Eſtate, the Poſſeſſion of which his Relations being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to reſign, they would not acknowledge the Mercy of Heaven, that had once more made him a rational Creature. In ſhort, he pleaded in ſuch a manner, that the Keeper was ſuſpected, his Relations were cenſur'd as Covetous and Unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and he himſelf was thought Maſter of ſo much Senſe, that the Chaplain reſolv'd to take him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him, that the Archbiſhop might be able to ſatisfy himſelf of the Truth of the whole Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. In order to this, the Credulous Chaplain deſir'd the Governour to give the Graduate the Habit which he had brought with him at his firſt coming. The Governour us'd all the Arguments which he thought might diſſwade the Chaplain from his Deſign, aſſuring him, that the Man was ſtill Frantick and diſorder'd in his Brain. But he could not prevail with him to leave the Mad-man there any longer, and therefore was forc'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the Archbiſhop's Order, and return'd the Man his Habit, which was neat and decent.</p>
                        <p>Having now Put off his Madman's Weeds, and finding himſelf in the Garb of rational Creatures, he begg'd of the Chaplain, for Charity's ſake, to permit him to take leave of his late Companions in
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:54446:355"/>
Affliction. The Chaplain told him he would bear him Company, having a mind to ſee the Mad-folks in the Houſe. So they went up Stairs, and with them ſome other People that ſtood by. Preſently the Graduate came to a kind of a Cage, where lay a Man that was outrageouſly Mad, though at that Inſtant ſtill and quiet; and addreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to him, Brother, ſaid he, have you any Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to command me? I am juſt going to my own Houſe, thanks be to Heaven, which, of its infinite Goodneſs and Mercy, has reſtor'd me to my Senſes. Be of good Comfort, and put your Truſt in the Father of Wiſdom, who will, I hope, be as Merciful to you as he has been to me. I'll be ſure to ſend you ſome choice Victuals, which I would have you eat by all means; for I muſt needs tell you, that I have Reaſon to imagine, from my own Experience, that all our Madneſs proceeds from keeping our Stomachs empty of Food, and our Brains full of Wind. Take heart then, my Friend, and be chearful; for, this deſponding in Misfortunes impairs our Health, and hurries us to the Grave. Juſt over againſt that Room lay another Mad-man, who having liſten'd with an envious Attention to all this Diſcourſe, ſtarts up from an old Mat on which he lay ſtark naked; Who's that, cry'd he aloud, that's going away ſo well recover'd, and ſo wiſe? 'Tis I, Brother, that am going, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the Graduate; I have now no need to ſtay here any longer; for which Bleſſing I can never ceaſe to return my humble and hearty Thanks to the infinite Goodneſs of Heaven. Dr. quoth the Mad-man, have a Care what you ſay, and let not the Devil delude you. Stir not a Foot, but keep ſnug in your old Lodging, and ſave your ſelf the curſed Vexation of being brought back to your

Kennel. Nay, anſwer'd the other, I'll warrant you there will be no Occaſion for my coming hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther again; I know I am perfectly Well. You Well! cry'd the Mad-man, we ſhall ſoon ſee that. — Farewell, but, by the Sovereign <hi>Jupiter,</hi> whoſe Majeſty I repreſent on Earth, for this very Crime alone, for ſetting thee at large, I ſay, and preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuouſly affirming that thou art ſound in thy Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects, I will take ſuch a ſevere Revenge on this whole City, that it ſhall be remember'd with Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror from Age to Age, and for ever and aye. Doſt thou not know, my poor Brainleſs Thing in a Gown, that this is in my Power? I that am the Thundring <hi>Jove,</hi> that graſp in my Hands the red-hot Bolts of Heaven, with which I keep the threaten'd World in awe, and might reduce it all to Aſhes. But ſtay, I will commute the fiery Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, which this ignorant Town deſerves, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another: I will only ſhut up the Flood-gates of the Skies, ſo that there ſhall not fall a Drop of Rain upon this City, nor on all the neighbouring Country round about it for three Years together; to begin from the very Moment that gives Date to this my inviolable Execration. Thou free! thou well, and in thy Senſes! and I here, mad, diſtemper'd, and confin'd! By my Thunder, I will no more indulge the Town with Rain, than I would hang my ſelf. As every one there was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to theſe loud and frantick Threats, the Graduate turn'd to the Chaplain, and taking him by the Hand, Sir, ſaid he, let not that Mad-man's Threats trouble you. Never mind him; for, if he be <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and will not let it Rain, I am <hi>Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi> the Parent and God of the Waters, and it ſhall Rain as often as I pleaſe, where ever Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhall require it. However, anſwer'd the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, good Mr. <hi>Neptune,</hi> 'tis not convenient to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:54446:356"/>
Mr. <hi>Jupiter:</hi> Therefore be pleas'd to ſtay here a little longer, and ſome other Time at convenient Leiſure, I may chance to find a better Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to wait on you, and bring you away. The Keeper and the reſt of the Company could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear Laughing, which put the Chaplain almoſt out of Countenance. In ſhort, Mr. <hi>Neptune</hi> was diſrob'd again, ſtay'd where he was, and there's an end of the Story.</p>
                        <p>Well, Mr. Barber, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and this is your Tale which you ſaid came ſo pat to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe, that you could not forbear telling it! Ah, Good-man Cut-beard, Good-man Cut-beard! How blind muſt he be that can't ſee thro' a Sieve! Is it poſſible your pragmatical Worſhip ſhould not know that Compariſons made between Wit and Wit, Courage and Courage, Beauty and Beauty, Birth and Birth, are always Odious and ill taken. I am not <hi>Neptune</hi> the God of the Waters, good Mr. Barber; neither do I pretend to ſet up for a wiſe Man when I am not ſo. All I aim at, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make the World ſenſible how much they are to blame, in not labouring to revive thoſe moſt happy Times, in which the Order of Knight-Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantry was in its full Glory. But indeed, this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Age of ours is unworthy the Enjoyment of ſo great a Happineſs, which former Ages could boaſt, when Knights-Errant took upon themſelves the Defence of Kingdoms, the Protection of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, the Relief of Orphans, the Puniſhment of Pride and Oppreſſion, and the Reward of Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Moſt of your Knights now-a-days keep a greater Ruſtling with their Sumptuous Garments of Damask, Gold-Brocade, and other coſtly Stuffs, than with the Coats of Mail, which they ſhould glory to wear. No Knight now will lie on the hard Ground in the open Field, expos'd to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:54446:356"/>
Air, from Head to Foot enclos'd in pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous Armour: Where are thoſe now, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking their Feet out of the Stirrups, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leaning on their Lances, like the Knights-Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Old, ſtrive to diſappoint invading Sleep, rather than indulge it? Where is that Knight, who having firſt travers'd a ſpacious Foreſt, climb'd up a ſteep Mountain, and journey'd over a diſmal bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Shore, waſh'd by a turbulent tempeſtuous Sea, and finding on the Brink a little Skiff deſtitute of Sails, Oars, Maſt, or any kind of Tackling, is yet ſo bold as to throw himſelf into the Boat with an undaunted Reſolution, and reſigns himſelf to the implacable Billows of the Main, that now mount him to the Skies, and then hurry him down to the moſt profound Receſſes of the Waters; till, with his inſuperable Courage, ſurmounting at laſt the Hurricane, even in its greateſt Fury, he finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf above three thouſand Leagues from the Place where he firſt embark'd, and leaping aſhore in a remote and unknown Region, meets with Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that deſerve to be recorded, not only on Parchment, but on <hi>Corinthian</hi> Braſs. But now, alas! Sloth and Effeminacy triumph over Vigilance and Labour, Idleneſs over Induſtry, Vice over Vertue, Arrogance over Valour, and the Theory of Arms over the Practice, that true Practice, which only liv'd and flouriſh'd in thoſe Golden Days, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe Profeſſors of Chivalry. For, where ſhall we hear of a Knight more Valiant and more Honourable than the Renowned <hi>Amadis de Gaul?</hi> Who more diſcreet than <hi>Palmerin</hi> of <hi>England?</hi> Who more Affable and Complaiſant than <hi>Tirante the White?</hi> Who more Gallant than <hi>Liſuarte</hi> of <hi>Greece?</hi> Who more Cut and Hack'd, or a greater Cutter and Hacker than Don <hi>Bellianis?</hi> Who more intrepid than <hi>Perion</hi> of <hi>Gaul?</hi> Who more Daring than <hi>Felixmarte</hi> of <hi>Hyrcania?</hi> Who more Sincere
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:54446:357"/>
than <hi>Eſplandian?</hi> Who more Courteous than <hi>Ciri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ongilio</hi> of <hi>Thrace?</hi> Who more Brave than <hi>Rodomont?</hi> Who more Prudent than King <hi>Sobrino?</hi> Who more Deſperate than <hi>Rinaldo?</hi> Who more Invincible than <hi>Orlando?</hi> And who more Agreeable or more Courteous than <hi>Rogero?</hi> from whom, (according to <hi>Turpin</hi> in his Geography) the Dukes of <hi>Ferrara</hi> are Deſcended? All theſe Champions, Mr. Curate, and a great many more that I could mention, were Knights-Errant, and the very Light and Glory of Chivalry; now, ſuch as theſe are the Men I would adviſe the King to employ; by which means his Majeſty would be effectually ſerv'd, and freed from a vaſt Expence, and the <hi>Turk</hi> would tear his very Beard for Madneſs. For my part, I don't deſign to ſtay where I am, becauſe the Chaplain will not fetch me out; tho', if <hi>Jupiter,</hi> as Mr. Barber ſaid, will ſend no Rain, here ſtands one that will, and can Rain, when he pleaſes. This I ſay, that Good-man Baſon here may know I underſtand his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Truly, good Sir, ſaid the Barber, I meant no ill, Heaven is my Witneſs, my Intent was good; and therefore I hope your Worſhip will take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing amiſs. Whether I ought to take it amiſs or no, reply'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> is beſt known to my ſelf. Well, ſaid the Curate, I have hardly ſpoken a Word yet; and before I go, I would gladly be eas'd of a Scruple, which Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Words ſtarted within me, and which grates and gnaws my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Mr. Curate may be free with me in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Matters, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and ſo may well tell his Scruple; for 'tis no Pleaſure to have a Burden upon one's Conſcience. With your leave then, Sir, ſaid the Curate, I muſt tell you, that I can by no means prevail with my ſelf to believe, that all this Multitude of Knights-Errant, which your Worſhip has mention'd, were ever real Men of
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:54446:357"/>
this World, and true ſubſtantial Fleſh and Blood; but rather, that whatever is ſaid of 'em is all Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Fiction, Lies and Dreams, related by Men rather half aſleep than awake. This is indeed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miſtake, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> into which many have been led, who do not believe there ever were any of thoſe Knights in the World. And in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Companies, I have many Times had occaſion to vindicate that manifeſt Truth from the almoſt univerſal Error, that is entertain'd to its Prejudice, Sometimes my Succeſs has not been anſwerable to the Goodneſs of my Cauſe, though at others is has; being ſupported on the Shoulders of Truth, which is ſo apparent, that I dare almoſt ſay, I have ſeen <hi>Amadis de Gaul</hi> with theſe very Eyes. He was a tall comely Perſonage, of a good and lively. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, his Beard well ſhaped and black, his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect at once awful and affable: A Man of few Words, ſlowly provok'd, and quickly pacify'd. And, as I have given you the Picture of <hi>Amadis,</hi> I fancy I could readily delineate all the Knights-Errant that are to be met with in Hiſtory: For once apprehending, as I do, that they were juſt ſuch as their Hiſtories report 'em, 'tis an eaſy mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to gueſs their Features, Statures and Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by the Rules of ordinary Philoſophy, and the Account we have of their Atchievements, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Humours. Pray, good Sir, quoth the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, how tall then might the Giant <hi>Morgante</hi> be? Whether there ever were Giants or no, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> is a Point much controverted among the Learned. However, the Holy Writ, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deviate an Atom from Truth, informs us there, were ſome, of which we have an Inſtance in the account it gives us of that huge <hi>Philiſtine, Goliah,</hi> who was ſeven Cubit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> and a half high; which is a prodigious Stature. Beſides, in <hi>Sicily</hi> Thigh-bones
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:54446:358"/>
and Shoulder-bones have been found of ſo immenſe a Size, that from thence of Neceſſity we muſt conclude by the certain Rules of Geometry, that the Men to whom they belong'd were Giants, as big as huge Steeples. But, for all this, I cannot poſitively tell you how big <hi>Morgante</hi> was; though I am apt to believe he was not very tall, and that which makes me inclinable to believe ſo, is, that in the Hiſtory which gives us a particular account of his Exploits, we read, that he often us'd to lie under a Roof. Now if there were any Houſe that could hold him, 'tis evident he could not be of an extraordinary bigneſs. That muſt be granted, ſaid the Curate, who took ſome Pleaſure in hearing him talk at that ſtrange Rate, and therefore ask'd him what his Sentiments were of the Faces of <hi>Rinaldo</hi> of <hi>Montalbon, Orlando,</hi> and the reſt of the twelve Peers of <hi>France,</hi> who had all of 'em been Knights-Errant? As for <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> I dare venture to ſay, he was broad-fac'd, of a rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Complexion, his Eyes ſparkling and large, very Captious, extremely Cholerick, and a Favourer of Robbers and profligate Fellows. As for <hi>Rolando, Rotolando,</hi> or <hi>Orlando</hi> (for all theſe ſeveral Names are given him in Hiſtory) I am of Opinion and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure my ſelf, that he was of a mean Stature, broad-ſhoulder'd, ſomewhat bandy-legg'd, brown-viſag'd, red-bearded, very hairy on his Body, ſurly-look'd, no Talker, but yet very civil and good-humour'd. If <hi>Orlando</hi> was no handſomer than you tell us, ſaid the Curate, no wonder if the fair <hi>Angelica</hi> ſlighted him, and preferr'd the brisk, pretty, charming, downy-chinn'd young <hi>Moor</hi> before him; neither was ſhe to blame to neglect the Roughneſs of the one for the ſoft Embraces of the other. That <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica,</hi> Mr Curate, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> was a diſſolute Damſel, a wild flirting wanton Creature, and
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:54446:358"/>
ſomewhat capricious to boot. She left the World as full of her Impertinences as of the Fame of her Beauty. She deſpis'd a thouſand Princes, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of the moſt valiant and diſcreet Knights in the whole World, and took up with a paultry beardleſs Page, that had neither Eſtate nor Honour, and who could lay Claim to no other Reputation, but that of being grateful, when he gave a Proof of his Affection to his Friend <hi>Dardinel.</hi> And indeed, even that great Extoller of her Beauty, the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated <hi>Arioſto,</hi> either not daring, or rather not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to rehearſe what happen'd to <hi>Angelica,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhe had ſo baſely Proſtituted her ſelf (which Paſſages doubtleſs could not be very much to her Reputation) that very <hi>Arioſto,</hi> I ſay, dropp'd her Character quite, and left her with theſe Verſes.</p>

                        <p>And without doubt this was a kind of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy; for the Denomination of <hi>Vates,</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a Prophet, is common to thoſe whom we otherwiſe call Poets. Accordingly indeed this Truth has been made evident; for in Proceſs of Time, a famous <hi>Andaluſian</hi> Poet wept for her, and celebrated her Tears in Verſe; and another emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and choice Poet of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> made her Beauty his Theme. But, pray Sir, ſaid the Barber, among ſo many Poets that have written in that Lady <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica</hi>'s Praiſe, did none of 'em ever write a Satyr upon her? Had <hi>Sacripante,</hi> or <hi>Orlando</hi> been Poets, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> I make no Queſtion but they would have handl'd her to ſome purpoſe; for there's nothing more common than for caſt Poets, when diſdain'd by their feign'd or falſe Miſtreſſes, to revenge themſelves with Satyrs and<pb n="650" facs="tcp:54446:359"/>
Lampoons; a Proceeding certainly unworthy a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Spirit. However, I never yet did hear of any Defamatory Verſes on the Lady <hi>Angelica,</hi> tho' ſhe made to much Miſchief in the World. That's a Miracle indeed, cry'd the Curate. But here they were interrupted by a Noiſe below in the Yard, where the Niece and the Houſe-keeper, who had left 'em ſome Time before, were very Obſtrepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, which made 'em all haſten to know what was the Matter.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the memorable Quarrel between <hi>Sancho Pança,</hi> and Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Niece and Houſe-keeper; with other pleaſant Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages.</head>
                        <p>THE Hiſtory informs us, that the Occaſion of the Noiſe which the Niece and Houſe-keeper made, was <hi>Sancho Pança</hi>'s endeavouring to force his way into the Houſe, while they at the ſame Time held the Door againſt him to keep him out. What have you to do in this Houſe, ye Paunch gutted Squob, cry'd one of 'em? Go, go, keep to your own home, Friend. 'Tis all along of you, and no body elſe, that my poor Maſter is Diſtracted; Debauch'd, and carry'd a Rambling all the Country over. Thou Houſe-keeper for the Devil, reply'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> 'Tis I that am Diſtracted, Debauch'd, and carried a Rambling, and not your Maſter.

<pb n="651" facs="tcp:54446:359"/>
wide of the Matter. 'Twas he that inveigled me from my Houſe and Home with his Colloguing, and ſaying he would give me an Iſland, which is not come yet, and I ſtill wait for. May'ſt thou be Choak'd with thy Plaguy Iſlands, cry'd the Niece, thou curſed Paunch! And what are your Iſlands? Any thing to Eat, Good-man Greedy-gut, ha? Hold you there, anſwer'd <hi>Sancho!</hi> They are not to Eat, but to Govern; and better Governments than any four Cities. or as many Heads of the King's beſt Corporations. For all that, quoth the Houſe-keeper, thou com'ſt not within theſe Doors, thou Bundle of Wickedneſs, and Sack-full of Roguery! Go, govern your own Houſe, Work you la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy Rogue! To the Plough, and ne'er trouble your Jolter-head about Iſlands or Oylets. The Curate and the Barber took a great deal of Pleaſure to hear this Dialogue. But Don <hi>Quixote</hi> fearing leſt <hi>Sancho</hi> ſhould not keep within Bounds, but blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-out ſome Diſcoveries prejudicial to his Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, while he ripp'd up a pack of little fooliſh Slander, call'd him in, and enjoyn'd the Women to be ſilent <hi>Sancho</hi> enter'd, and the Curate and the Barber took leave of Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Cure, conſidering how deep his folly was rooted in his Brain, and how bewitch'd he was with his ſilly Knight-Errantry. Well, Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, ſaid the Curate to the Barber, now do I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect nothing better of our Gentleman, than to hear ſhortly he is gone upon another Ramble. Nor I neither, anſwer'd the Barber; but I don't wonder ſo much at the Knight's Madneſs, as at the Sillineſs of the Squire, who thinks himſelf ſo ſure of the Iſland, that I fancy all the Art of Man cou'd never beat it out of his Scull. Heaven mend 'em, ſaid the Curate! In the mean time let us obſerve 'em; we ſhall find what will be the Event of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="652" facs="tcp:54446:360"/>
Extravagance of the Knight, and the fooliſheſs of the Squire. One wou'd think they had been caſt in one Mould; and indeed the Maſter's Madneſs without the Man's Impertinence, were not worth a Ruſh. 'Tis ſo, ſaid the Barber, and now they are together, methinks I long to know what paſſes between 'em. I don't doubt but the two Women will be able to give an account of that, for they are not of a Temper to withſtand the Temptation of Liſtening. Mean while Don <hi>Quixote</hi> having Lock'd himſelf up with his Squre, they had the following Colloquy. I take it very ill, ſaid he, <hi>Sancho,</hi> that you ſhou'd report, as you do, that I enticed you out of your paltry Hut, when you know, that I my ſelf, left my own Manſion-Houſe. We ſet out together, continu'd together, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd together. We ran the ſame Fortune, and the ſame Hazards together. If thou haſt been toſs'd in a Blanket once, I have been batter'd and bruis'd a hundred Times, and that's all the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage I have had above thee. And reaſon good, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd <hi>Sancho;</hi> for you your ſelf uſe to ſay, that Ill-luck and Croſs-Bitings are oftner to light on the Knights than on their Squires. Thou art miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, <hi>Sancho,</hi> reply'd Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb will tell thee, that <hi>Quando caput dolet,</hi> &amp;c. Nay, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I underſtand no Language but my own. I mean, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> that when the Head akes, all the Members partake of the Pain: So then, as I am thy Maſter, I am alſo thy Head; and as thou art my Servant, thou art one of my Members; it follows therefore, that I cannot be ſenſible of Pain, but thou too ought'ſt to be affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it; and likewiſe that nothing of ill can befall thee, but I muſt bear a Share. Right, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> but yet when I, as a Limb of you, was toſs'd in a Blanket, my Head was pleas'd to ſtay
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:54446:360"/>
a' t'other ſide the Wall, and ſaw me frisking in the Air, without going Snacks in my Bodily Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Thou art greatly miſtaken, <hi>Sancho,</hi> anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> if thou think'ſt I was not ſenſible of thy Suff'rings: For I was then more Tortur'd in Mind, than thou waſt tormented in Body; but let us adjourn this Diſcourſe till ſome other Time, which doubtleſs will afford us an Opportunity to redreſs paſt Grievances I pray thee tell me now what does the Town ſay of me? What do the Neighbours, what do the People think of me? What ſay the Gentry, and the better ſort? How do the Knights diſcourſe of my Valour, my high Feats of Arms, and my courteous Behaviour? What Thoughts do they entertain of my Deſign to raiſe from the Grave of Oblivion the Order of Knight-Errantry, and reſtore it to the World? In ſhort, tell me freely and ſincerely whatever thou haſt heard; neither enlarg'd with flattering Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, nor leſſen'd by any Omiſſion of my Diſpraiſe; for 'tis the Duty of Faithful Servants to lay Truth before their Maſters in its Honourable Nakedneſs. And I would have thee know, <hi>Sancho,</hi> that if it were to appear before Princes, in its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Simplicity, and diſrobed of the odious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe of Flattery, we ſhould ſee happier Days; this Age would be chang'd into an Age of Gold, and former Times compar'd to this, would be call'd the Iron Age. Remember this, and be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd, that I may hear thee impart a faithful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of theſe Matters. That I will, with all my Heart, anſwer'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſo your Worſhip will not take it amiſs, if I tell what I have heard, juſt as I heard it, and neither better nor worſe. Nothing ſhall provoke me to Anger, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> ſpeak freely, and without any Circumlocution. Why then, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> firſt and foremoſt you
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:54446:361"/>
are to know, that the common People take you for a downright Mad-man, and me for one that has not much Guts in his Brains. The Gentry ſay, that not being content to keep within the Bounds of Gentility, you have taken upon you to be a <hi>Don,</hi> and ſet up for a Knight, and Right Worſhipful, with a ſmall Vineyard, and two Acres of Land, a Tatter before, and another behind. The Knights forſooth, take Pepper i'th' Noſe, and ſay, they don't like to have your ſmall Gentry think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as good as they, eſpecially your Old-faſhion'd Country Squires that mend and Lamp-black their own Shoes, and darn ye their old black Stockings themſelves with a Needleful of Green Silk. All this does not affect me, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> for I always wear good Cloaths, and never have 'em patch'd. 'Tis true, they may be a little torn ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, but that's more with my Armour than my long Wearing. As for what relates to your Prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs, (ſaid <hi>Sancho</hi> proceeding) together with your Feats of Arms, your courteous Behaviour, and your Undertaking, there are ſeveral Opinions about it. Some ſay he's Mad, but a pleaſant ſort of a Mad-man; others ſay he's Valiant, but his Luck is nought; others, he's Courteous, but damn'd Impertinent. And thus they ſpend ſo many Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts upon you, and take us both ſo to pieces, that they leave neither you nor me a ſound Bone in our Skins. Conſider <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> that the more eminently Vertue ſhines, the more 'tis expos'd to the Perſecution of Envy. Few or none of thoſe Famous Heroes of Antiquity, could eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the Venomous Arrows of Calumny. <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> that moſt Couragious, Prudent and Valiant Captain, was mark'd, as being Ambitious, and neither ſo clean in his Apparel, nor in his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners as he ought to have been. <hi>Alexander,</hi> whoſe
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:54446:361"/>
mighty Deeds gain'd him the Title of the Great, was charg'd with being addicted to Drunkenneſs. <hi>Hercules,</hi> after his many Heroick Labours was-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd of Voluptuouſneſs and Effeminacy. Don <hi>Galaor,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Amadis de Gaul,</hi> was tax'd with being Quarrelſome, and his Brother himſelf with being a Whining, Blubbering Lover. And therefore, my <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſince ſo many Worthies have not been free from the Attacks of Detraction, well may I be content to bear my Share of that Epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Calamity, if it be no more than thou haſt told me now. Body of my Father! quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> there's the Buſineſs; you ſay well, if this were all: But they don't ſtop here. Why, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> what can they ſay more? More, cry'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> Oddſnigs! we are ſtill to flea the Cat's Tail. You have had nothing yet but Apple-Pies and Sugar-Plumbs. But if you have a Mind to hear all thoſe Slanders and Back-bitings that are about Town concerning your Worſhip, I'll bring you one anon that ſhall tell you every kind of thing that's ſaid of you, without bating you an Ace on't; <hi>Bartholomew Carraſco</hi>'s Son I mean, who has been a Scholard at the Verſity of <hi>Salamanca,</hi> and is got to be a Batchelor of Arts. He came laſt Night, you muſt know, and as I went to bid him welcome home, he told me, that your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Hiſtory is already in Books, by the Name of the moſt Renowned Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha.</hi> He ſays I am in too, by my own Name of <hi>Sancho Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ça,</hi> and eke alſo my Lady <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo;</hi> nay, and many things that paſs'd betwixt no body but us two, which I was amaz'd to hear, and cou'd not for my Soul imagine, how the Devil he that ſet 'em down cou'd come by the Knowledge of 'em. I dare aſſure thee, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> that the Author of our Hiſtory muſt be ſome
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:54446:362"/>
Sage Inchantor, and one of thoſe, from whoſe uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Knowledge, none of the things which they have a Mind to Record can be conceal'd. How ſhould he be a Sage and an Inchanter, quoth <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho?</hi> The Batchelor <hi>Sampſon Carraſco,</hi> for that's the Name of my Tale's Maſter, tells me, he that wrote the Hiſtory, is call'd <hi>Cid Hamet,</hi>

That may very well be, anſwer'd <hi>Sancho.</hi> But if you'll have me fetch you the young Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard, I'll fly to bring him hither. Truly, Friend, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> thou wilt do me a particular Kindneſs; for what thou haſt already told me, has ſo ſill'd me with Doubts and Expectations, that I ſhall not eat a Bit that will do me good till I am inform'd of the whole Matter. I'll go and fetch him, ſaid <hi>Sancho.</hi> With that, leaving his Maſter, he went to look for the Batchelor, and having brought him along with him a while after, they all had a very pleaſant Dialogue.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>DON <hi>Quixote</hi> remain'd ſtrangely penſive, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the Batchelor <hi>Carraſco,</hi> from whom he hop'd to hear News of himſelf, Recorded and Printed in a Book, as <hi>Sancho</hi> had inform'd him: He could not be perſwaded that there was ſuch a Hiſtory extant, while yet the Blood of thoſe Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies he had cut off had ſcarce done reeking on the Blade of his Sword; ſo that they could not have already finiſh'd and printed the Hiſtory of his Mighty Feats of Arms. However, at laſt he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that ſome Learned Sage had, by the way of Inchantment, been able to commit them to the Preſs, either as a Friend, to extol his Heroick At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements above the Nobleſt Performances of the moſt Famous Knights-Errant, or as an Enemy, to fully and annihilate the Luſtre of his great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits, and debaſe 'em below the moſt inferiour Actions that ever were mention'd of any of the meaneſt Squires. Though (thought he to himſelf) the Actions of Squires were never yet Recorded; and after all, if there were ſuch a Book Printed, ſince it was the Hiſtory of a Knight-Errant, it could not chuſe but be Pompous, Lofty, Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent and Authentick. This Thought yielded him a while ſome ſmall Conſolation; but then he relaps'd into Melancholick Doubts and Anxieties,
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:54446:363"/>
when he conſider'd that the Author had given himſelf the Title of <hi>Cid,</hi> and conſequently muſt be a <hi>Moor:</hi> A Nation from whom no Truth could be expected, they all being given to impoſe on others with Lies and fabulous Stories, to Falſify and Counterfeit, and very fond of their own Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera's. He was not leſs uneaſie, leſt that Writer ſhould have been too laviſh in treating of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, to the Prejudice of his Lady <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo</hi>'s Honour. He earneſtly wiſh'd, that he might find his own inviolable Fidelity celebrated in the Hiſtory, and the Reſervedneſs and Decency which he had always ſo Religiouſly obſerved in his Paſſion for her; ſlighting Queens, Empreſſes, and Damſels of every degree for her ſake, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the dangerous impulſes of natural Deſire. <hi>Sancho</hi> and <hi>Carraſco</hi> found him thus agitated and perplex'd with a thouſand melancholick Fancies, which yet did not hinder him from receiving the Stranger with a great deal of Civility.</p>
                        <p>This Batchelour, though his Name were <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> was none of the biggeſt in Body, but a very great Man at all manner of Drollery; he had a Pale and bad Complexion, but good Senſe. He was about four and twenty years of Age, round Viſag'd, flat Nos'd, and wide Mouth'd, all ſigns of a malicious Diſpoſition, and of one that would delight in nothing more than in making Sport for himſelf, by Ridiculing others; as he plainly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd when he ſaw Don <hi>Quixote.</hi> For, falling on his Knees before him, admit me to kiſs your Honour's Hand, cry'd he, moſt Noble Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote;</hi> for by the Habit of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> which I wear, (though indeed I have as yet taken but the four firſt of the Holy Orders) you are certainly one of the moſt Renowned Knights-Errant that ever was, or ever will be through the whole extent of the
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:54446:363"/>
habitable Globe. Bleſt, may the Sage <hi>Cid Hamet Benengeli</hi> be, for inriching the World with the Hiſtory of your mighty Deeds; and more than Bleſt, that curious Virtuoſo, who took care to have it Tranſlated out of the <hi>Arabick</hi> into our vulgar Tongue, for the univerſal Entertainment of Mankind! Sir, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> making him riſe, is it then poſſible that my Hiſtory is extant, and that it was a <hi>Moor,</hi> and one of the Sages that Penn'd it? 'Tis ſo notorious a Truth, ſaid the Batchelour, that I do not in the leaſt doubt but at this Day there have already been Publiſh'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove twelve thouſand Copies of it. <hi>Portugal, Barce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona,</hi> and <hi>Valencia,</hi> where they have been Printed, can Witneſs that, if there were occaſion. 'Tis ſaid, that 'tis alſo now in the Preſs at <hi>Antwerp.</hi> And I verily believe there's ſcarce a Language into which it is not to be Tranſlated. Truly, Sir, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> one of the things that ought to yield the greateſt Satisfaction to a Perſon of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Virtue, is to live to ſee himſelf in good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation in the World, and his Actions publiſh'd in Print. I ſay in good Reputation, for otherwiſe there's no Death but would be preferable to ſuch a Life. As for a good Name and Reputation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd <hi>Carraſco,</hi> your Worſhip has gain'd the Palm from all the Knight-Errants that ever liv'd: For, both the <hi>Arabian</hi> in his Hiſtory, and the Chriſtian in his Verſion, have been very Induſtrious to do Juſtice to your Character; your peculiar Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, your Intrepidity and greatneſs of Spirit in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronting Danger; your Conſtancy in Adverſities, your Patience in ſuffering Wounds and Afflictions; your Modeſty and Continence in that Amour, ſo very <hi>Platonick,</hi> between your Worſhip and my Lady <hi>Donna Dulcinea del Toboſo.</hi> Odsbobs! cry'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> I never heard her call'd ſo before, that
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:54446:364"/>
                           <hi>Donna</hi> is a new kick; for ſhe us'd to be call'd only my Lady <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo;</hi> in that, the Hiſtory is out already. That's no material Objection, ſaid <hi>Carraſco.</hi> No, certainly, added Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> But pray, good Mr. Batchelor, on which of all my Adventures does the Hiſtory ſeem to lay the greateſt ſtreſs of Remark? As to that, anſwer'd <hi>Carraſco,</hi> the Opinions of Men are divided accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Taſtes: Some cry up the Adventure of the Wind-mills, which appear'd to your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſo many <hi>Briareus</hi>'s and Giants. Some are for that of the Fulling-mills: Others ſtand up for the Deſcription of the two Armies, that afterwards prov'd two Flocks of Sheep. Others prize moſt the Adventure of the dead Corps that was carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Segovia.</hi> One ſays that none of them can compare with that of the Galley-Slaves; another, that none can ſtand in Competition with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture of the <hi>Benedictine</hi> Giants and the Valorous <hi>Biſcayner.</hi> Pray, Mr. Batchelor, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> is there nothing ſaid of that of the <hi>Yangueſians,</hi> an't pleaſe you, when our precious <hi>Rozinante</hi> was ſo Mawl'd for offering to take a little Carnal Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with their Mares? There's not the leaſt thing omitted, anſwer'd <hi>Carraſco;</hi> the Sage has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted all with the niceſt punctuality imaginable; ſo much as the Capers which honeſt <hi>Sancho</hi> fetch'd in the Blanket. I fetch'd none in the Blanket quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but in the Air; and that too, oftner than I cou'd ha' wiſh'd, the more my Sorrow. In my Opinion, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> there is no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Hiſtory in the World, where you ſhall not find variety of Fortune; much leſs any Story of Knight-Errantry, where a Man cannot always be ſure of good Succeſs. However, ſaid <hi>Carraſco,</hi> ſome who have read your Hiſtory, wiſh that the Author had ſpar'd himſelf the pains of Regiſt'ring
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:54446:364"/>
ſome of that infinite number of Drubs which the Noble Don <hi>Quixote</hi> receiv'd. There lies the Truth of the Hiſtory, quoth <hi>Sancho.</hi> Thoſe things in human Equity, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> might very well have been omitted; for Actions that neither impair nor alter the Hiſtory, ought rather to be bury'd in Silence than related, if they redound to the Diſcredit of the chief Perſon. Certainly <hi>Aeneas</hi> was never ſo Pious as <hi>Virgil</hi> repreſents him, nor <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> ſo Prudent as he is made by <hi>Homer.</hi> I am of your Opinion ſaid <hi>Carraſco;</hi> but 'tis one thing to write like a Poet, and another thing to write like an Hiſtorian. 'Tis ſufficient for the firſt to deliver matters as they ought to have been, whereas the laſt muſt relate 'em as they were really tranſacted, without adding or omitting any thing, upon any pretence whatever. Well, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> if this ſame <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Lord be once got into the Road of Truth, a hundred to one but among my Maſter's Rib-roaſtings he has not forgot mine; for they never took Meaſure of his Worſhip's Shoulders, but they were pleas'd to do as much for my whole Body: But 'twas no Wonder; for 'tis his own Rule, that if once his Head aches, every Limb muſt ſuffer too. <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> you are an arch unlucky Knave; upon my Honour you can find Memory when you have a mind to have it. Nay, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> though I were minded to forget the Rubs and Drubs I ha' ſuffer'd, the Bumps and Tokens that are yet freſh on my Ribs would not let me. Hold your Tongue, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and let the Learned Batchelor proceed, that I may know what the Hiſtory ſays of me. And of me too, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> for they tell me I am one of the top Parſons in't. Perſons, you ſhould ſay, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid <hi>Carraſco,</hi> and not Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Hey-day! quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> have we got ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:54446:365"/>
Corrector of hard Words. If this be the Trade, we ſhall never ha' done. May I be curs'd, ſaid <hi>Carraſco,</hi> if you be not the ſecond Perſon in the Hiſtory, honeſt <hi>Sancho;</hi> nay, and ſome there are who had rather hear you talk than the beſt there; though ſome there are again that will ſay, you were horribly Credulous to flatter your ſelf with having the Government of that Iſland, which your Maſter here preſent promis'd you. While there's Life there's Hope, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> when <hi>Sancho</hi> is grown Mature with Time and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he may be better qualify'd for a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than he is yet. Odsbodikins! Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> if I been't fit to Govern an Iſland at theſe Years, I ſhall never be a Governor, though I live to the Years of <hi>Methuſalah;</hi> but there the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief lies, we have Brains enough, but we want the Iſland. Come, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> hope for the beſt; truſt in Providence; all will be well, and perhaps better than you imagine: But know, there's not a Leaf on any Tree that can be mov'd without the permiſſion of Heaven. That's very true, ſaid <hi>Carraſco;</hi> and I dare ſay, <hi>Sancho</hi> ſhall not want a thouſand Iſlands to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, much leſs one, that is, if it be Heaven's Will. Why not, quoth <hi>Sancho?</hi> I ha' ſeen Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors in my time, who, to my thinking, could not come up to me paſſing the Sole of my Shooes, and yet forſooth, they call'd them your Honour, and they eat their Victuals all in Silver. Ay, ſaid <hi>Carraſco,</hi> but theſe were none of your Governors of Iſlands, but of other eaſie Governments: Why, Man, theſe ought at leaſt to know their Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar. Ay, ay, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> give me but a <hi>gray Mare</hi> once, and I ſhall know her well enough, I'll warrant ye. But leaving the Government in the Hands of him that will beſt provide for me, I
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:54446:365"/>
muſt tell you, Maſter Batchelor <hi>Sampſon Carraſco,</hi> I am huge glad that as your Author has not forgot me, ſo he has not given an Ill Character of me; for by the Faith of a truſty Squire, had he ſaid any thing that did not become<note n="*" place="bottom">A Name the <hi>Spaniards</hi> deſire to be diſtinguiſh'd from the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Moors</hi> by.</note> an <hi>Old Chriſtian</hi> as I am, I had rung him ſuch a Peal, that the Deaf ſhould have heard me. That were a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, ſaid <hi>Carraſco.</hi> Miracle me no more Miracles, cry'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> let every Man take care how he talks, or how he writes of other Men, and not ſet down at Random, Higgle-de-piggledy, what ever comes into his Noddle. One of the faults found with this Hiſtory, ſaid <hi>Carraſco,</hi> is, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has thruſt into't a Novel, which he calls <hi>The Curious Impertinent;</hi> not that 'tis ill Writ; or the Deſign of it to be miſlik'd; but becauſe it is not in its right place, and has no coherence with the Story of Don <hi>Quixote.</hi> I'll lay my Life, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> the Son of a Mungrel has made a Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mawfry of it all. Now, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that he who attempted to write my Hiſtory, is not one of the Sages, but ſome ignorant prating Fool, who would needs be meddling and ſet up for a Scribbler, without the leaſt grain of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to help him out; and ſo he has done like <hi>Orbaneja,</hi> the Painter of <hi>Ubeda,</hi> who being ask'd what he Painted, anſwer'd, as it may hit; and when he had ſcrawl'd out a Miſ-ſhapen Cock, was forc'd to write underneath it in <hi>Gothick</hi> Letters, <hi>This is a Cock.</hi> At this rate, I believe he has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd in my Hiſtory, ſo that it will require a Commentary to explain it. Not at all, anſwer'd <hi>Carraſco,</hi> for he has made every thing ſo plain,
<pb n="664" facs="tcp:54446:366"/>
that there's not the leaſt thing in't but what any one may underſtand. Children handle it, Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters read it, Men underſtand it, and Old People Applaud it. In ſhort, 'tis univerſally ſo thumb'd, ſo glean'd, ſo ſtudi'd, and ſo known, that if the People do but ſee a Lean Horſe, they preſently cry, there goes <hi>Rozinante.</hi> But none apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the reading it more than your Pages: There's ne'er a Nobleman's Antichamber where you ſhan't find a Don <hi>Quixote.</hi> No ſooner has one laid it down, but another takes it up. One asks for it here, and there 'tis ſnatch'd up by another. In a Word, 'tis eſteem'd the moſt Pleaſant and leaſt Dangerous Diverſion that ever was ſeen, as being a Book that does not betray the leaſt indecent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, nor ſo much as a profane Thought. To write after another manner, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> were not to write Truth but Falſhood; and thoſe Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torians who are guilty of that, ſhould be puniſh'd like thoſe who Counterfeit the Lawful Coin. But I cannot conceive what could move the Author to ſtuff his Hiſtory with Foreign Novels and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, not at all to the Purpoſe, while there was a ſufficient Number of my own to have exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd his Pen. Without doubt they ſhould obſerve the Proverb. <hi>Ne'er ſtuff the Cuſhion with Straw, if you have Down enough.</hi> And certainly, had he alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether confin'd himſelf to my Thoughts, my Sighs, my Tears, my laudable Deſigns, my Adventures, he might yet have ſwell'd his Book to as great a Bulk at leaſt as all <hi>Toſtatus</hi>'s Works. I have alſo reaſon to believe, Mr Batchelor, that to compile a Hiſtory or write any Book whatſoever, is a more difficult Task than Men imagine. There's need of a vaſt Judgement and a ripe Underſtanding. It belongs to none but great Genius's to expreſs themſelves with Grace and Elegance, and draw
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:54446:366"/>
the Manners and Actions of others to the Life. The moſt Artful Part in a Play is the Fool's, and therefore a Fool muſt not pretend to write it. On the other ſide, Hiſtory is in a manner a ſacred thing, ſo far as it contains Truth; for where Truth is, the Supreme Father of it may alſo be ſaid to be, at leaſt in as much as concerns Truth. However there are Men, that will make you Books and turn 'em looſe into the World, with as much diſpatch as they would do a Diſh of Fritters. There's no Book ſo bad, ſaid the Batchelor, but ſome good thing may be found in it. That's true, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> yet 'tis a common thing for Men, who had gain'd a very great Reputation by their Writings, before they Printed them, to loſe it afterwards quite, or at leaſt the greateſt part. The Reaſon's plain, ſaid <hi>Carraſco,</hi> their Faults are more eaſily diſcover'd after their Books are Printed, as being then more read, and more narrowly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd; the rather if the Author has been much cry'd up before, the ſeverity of the ſcrutiny is ſo much the greater. All thoſe that have rais'd themſelves a Name by their Ingenuity, great Poets and Celebrated Hiſtorians, are moſt commonly, if not always, envy'd by a ſort of Men, who delight in Cenſuring the Writings of others, though they never Publiſh'd any of their own. That's no Wonder, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> for there are many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, that could make but very dull Preachers, and yet are very quick at finding faults and ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in other Men's Sermons. All this is truth, reply'd <hi>Carraſco;</hi> and therefore I could wiſh theſe Cenſurers would be more merciful and leſs ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous, and not dwell ungenerouſly upon ſmall Spots, that are in a manner but ſo many Atoms on the Face of the clear Sun which they murmur at. <hi>Si aliquando bonus dormitat Homerus,</hi> let 'em
<pb n="666" facs="tcp:54446:367"/>
conſider how many Nights he kept himſelf awake to bring his Noble Works to light as little darken'd with Defects as might be. Nay, many times it may happen that what is Cenſur'd for a Fault is rather an Ornament, like Moles that ſometimes add to the Beauty of the Face. And when all is ſaid, he that Publiſhes a Book runs a very great Hazard, ſince nothing can be more impoſſible than to compoſe one that may ſecure the Approbation of every Reader. Sure, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> that which treats of me can have pleas'd but few. Quite contrary, ſaid <hi>Carraſco,</hi> for as <hi>Stultorum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitus eſt numerus,</hi> ſo an infinite Number has admir'd your Hiſtory. Only ſome there are who have tax'd the Author with want of Memory or Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity; becauſe he has forgot to give an account, who it was that ſtole <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Dapple; for that Particular is not mention'd there; only we find by the Story that it was ſtol'n; and yet by and by we find him riding the ſame Aſs again, without any previous light given us into the matter. Then they ſay, that the Author forgot to tell the Reader, what <hi>Sancho</hi> did with thoſe hundred pieces of Gold he found in the Portmanteau in <hi>Sierra Morena;</hi> for there's not a Word ſaid of 'em more; and many People have a great mind to know what he did with 'em, and how he ſpent 'em; which is one of the moſt material Points, in which the Work is defective. Maſter <hi>Sampſon,</hi> quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I an't now in a condition to caſt up my Accompts, for I'm taken ill of a ſudden with ſuch a wambling in the Stomach, and find my ſelf ſo maukiſh, that if I don't ſee and fetch it up with a ſup or two of good old Bub, I ſhall waſte like the ſnuff of a farthing Candle. I have that Cordial at home, and my Chuck ſtays for me. When I have had my Dinner, I am for you, and will ſatisfy you,
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:54446:367"/>
or any Man that wears a Head, about any thing in the World, either as to the Loſs of the Aſs, or the laying out of thoſe ſame Pieces of Gold. This ſaid, without a Word more, or waiting for a Reply, away he went. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> deſir'd and entreated the Batchelor to ſtay and do Pennance with him. The Batchelor accepted his Invitation, and ſtay'd. A Couple of Pigeons were got ready to mend their Commons. All Dinner-time they diſcours'd about Knight-Errantry, <hi>Carraſco</hi> hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouring him all the while. After they had ſlept out the Heat of the Day, <hi>Sancho</hi> came back, and they renew'd their former Diſcourſe.</p>

from <hi>Dapple,</hi> both ſaddly bruis'd and tir'd with our late Skirmiſhes, fell faſt aſleep, and ſlept as ſoundly as if we had had four Feather-beds under us; but I eſpecially was as ſerious at it as any Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſe; ſo that the Thief, whoever he was, had Leiſure enough to clap four Stakes under the four Corners of the Pack-Saddle, and then leading a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Aſs from between my Legs, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perceiv'd by me in the leaſt, there he fairly left me mounted. This is no new thing, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> nor is it difficult to be done: With the ſame Stratagem <hi>Sacripante</hi> had his Steed ſtol'n from under him by that notorious Thief <hi>Brunelo</hi> at the Siege of <hi>Albraca.</hi> It was broad Day, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> going on, when I, half awake and half aſleep, began to ſtretch my ſelf in my Pack-ſaddle; but with my Stirring down came the Stakes, and down came I ſouſe, with a confounded Squelch on the Ground. Preſently I look'd for my Aſs, but no Aſs was to be found. Oh how thick the Tears trickl'd from my Eyes, and what a piteous Moan I made! If he that made our Hiſtory has forgot to ſet it down Word for Word, I wou'd not give a Ruſh for his Book, I'll tell him that. Some Time after, I can't juſt tell you how long it was, as we were going with my Lady the Princeſs <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comicona,</hi> I knew my Aſs again, and he that rid him, though he went like a Gypſy; and who ſhou'd it be, d'ye think, but <hi>Gines de Paſſamonte,</hi> that Son of Miſchief, that Crack-Rope, whom my Maſter and I ſav'd from the Galleys. The Miſtake does not lie there, ſaid <hi>Carraſco;</hi> but only that the Author ſets you upon the ſame Aſs that was loſt, before he gives an Account of his being found. As to that, reply'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> I don't know very well what to ſay. If the Man made a Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der who can help it? But mayhaps 'twas a Fault
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:54446:368"/>
of the Printer. I make no Queſtion of that, ſaid <hi>Carraſco;</hi> but pray what became of the hundred Pieces? were they ſunk? I fairly ſpent 'em on my ſelf, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> and on my Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; they help'd me to lay my Spouſe's Clack, and made her take ſo patiently my rambling and trotting after my Maſter Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> for had I come back with empty Pockets, and without my Aſs, I muſt have look'd for a rueful Greeting. And now if you have any more to ſay to me, here am I, ready to anſwer the King himſelf; for what has any Body to meddle or make whether I found or found not, or ſpent or ſpent not? If the Knocks and Swadlings that have been beſtow'd on my Carcaſs in our Jaunts, were to be rated but at three <hi>Maravedis</hi> apiece, and I to be ſatisfy'd Ready-Caſh for every one, a hundred Pieces of Gold more would not pay for half of them; and therefore let every Man lay his Finger on his Mouth, and not run Hand over Head, and miſtake Black for White and White for Black; for every Man is as Heaven made him, and ſometimes a great deal worſe. Well, ſaid the Batchelor, if the Author prints another Edition of the Hiſtory, I'll take ſpecial Care he ſhan't forget to inſert what honeſt <hi>Sancho</hi> has ſaid, which will make the Book as good again. Pray, good Mr. Batchelor, ask'd Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote,</hi> are there any other Emendations requiſite to be made in this Hiſtory? Some there are, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd <hi>Carraſco,</hi> but none of ſo much Importance as thoſe already mention'd. Perhaps the Author promiſes a Second Part, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote?</hi> He does, ſaid <hi>Carraſco;</hi> but he ſays he cannot find it, neither can he diſcover who has it: So that we doubt whether it will come out or no; as well for this Reaſon, as becauſe ſome People ſay that <hi>Second Parts</hi> are never worth any thing, others cry
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:54446:369"/>
there's enough of Don <hi>Quixote</hi> already: However many of thoſe that love Mirth better than Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, cry out, Give us more <hi>Quixotery;</hi> let but Don <hi>Quixote</hi> appear, and <hi>Sancho</hi> talk, be it what it will, we are ſatisfy'd. And how ſtands the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor affected? ſaid the Knight. Truly, anſwer'd <hi>Carraſco,</hi> as ſoon as ever he can find out the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which he is now looking for with all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Induſtry, he is reſolv'd to ſend it immediately to the Preſs, though more for his own Profit than through any Ambition of Applauſe. What, quoth <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> does he deſign to do it to get a Penny by't? nay, then we are like to have a rare Hiſtory indeed, we ſhall have him botch and whip it up, like your Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors on <hi>Eaſter-Eve,</hi> and give us a Huddle of Flim-flams that will never hang together; for your haſty Work can never be done as it ſhould be. Let Mr. <hi>Moor</hi> take Care how he goes to work; for, my Life for his, I and my Maſter will ſtock him with ſuch a Heap of Stuff in Matter of Adventures and odd Chances, that he'll have enough not only to write a Second Part but an hundred. The poor Fellow, belike, thinks we do nothing but ſleep on a Hay-mow; but let us once put Foot into the Stirrup, and he'll ſee what we are about: This at leaſt I'll be bold to ſay, that if my Maſter would be rul'd by me, we had been in the Field by this Time, undoing of Miſdeeds and righting of Wrongs, as good Knights-Errant uſe to do. Scarce had <hi>Sancho</hi> made an End of his Diſcourſe, when <hi>Rozinante</hi>'s Neighing reach'd their Ears. Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote</hi> took it for a lucky Omen, and reſolv'd to take another Turn within three or four Days. He diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd his Reſolutions to the Batchelor, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted him to know which Way he ſhou'd ſteer his Courſe. The Batchelor advis'd him to take the Road of <hi>Saragoſa</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Arragon,</hi> a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:54446:369"/>
Tournament being ſhortly to be perform'd at that City on St. <hi>George</hi>'s Feſtival; where by worſting all the <hi>Arragonian</hi> Champions he might win immortal Honour, ſince to out-tilt them would be to out-rival all the Knights in the Univerſe. He alſo applauded his Deſign, but withal admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd him not to be ſo deſperate in expoſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Dangers, ſince his Life was not his own, but theirs who in Diſtreſs ſtood in want of his Aſſiſtance and Protection. That's it now, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that makes me ſometimes ready to run mad, Mr. Batchelor; for my Maſter makes no more to ſet upon an hundred armed Men, than a young hungry Taylor to guttle down half a Dozen of Cucumbers. Body of me! Maſter Batchelor, there's a Time to retreat as well as a Time to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſail; <hi>Sant Jago</hi> and <hi>hey for the Honour of</hi> Spain muſt not always be the Cry: For I've heard Somebody ſay, and, if I an't miſtaken, 'twas my Maſter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that Valour lies juſt half-way between Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Cowheartedneſs; and if it be ſo, I would not have him run away without there's a Reaſon for't, nor would I have him fall on when there's no Good to be got by't. But above all things I wou'd have him to know, if he has a Mind I ſhou'd go with him, that the Bargain is he ſhall fight for us both, and that I am ty'd to nothing but to look after him and his Victuals and Cloaths: So far as this comes to, I will fetch and carry like any Water-Spaniel; but to think I'll lug out my Sword, though it be but againſt poor Rogues, and ſorry Shirks, and Hedge-birds, y'troth I muſt beg his Diverſion. For my Part, Mr. Batchelor, 'tis not the Fame of being thought valiant that I aim at, but that of being deem'd the very beſt and truſtieſt Squire that ever follow'd the Heels of a Knight-Errant: And if, after all my Services, my
<pb n="672" facs="tcp:54446:370"/>
Maſter Don <hi>Quixote</hi> will be ſo kind as to give me one of thoſe many Iſlands which his Worſhip ſays he ſhall light on, I ſhall be much beholding to him; but if he does not, why then I am born, d'ye ſee, and one Man muſt not live to rely on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, but on his Maker. Mayhaps the Bread I ſhall eat without Government, will go down more ſavourily than if I were a Governour; and what do I know but that the Devil is providing me one of theſe Governments for a Stumbling-block, that I may ſtumble and fall, and ſo break my Jaws, and ding out my Butter-Teeth. I was born <hi>Sancho,</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> I mean to die; and yet for all that, if fairly and ſquarely, with little Trouble and leſs Danger, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven would beſtow on me an Iſland, or ſome ſuch-like Matter, I'm no ſuch Fool neither, d'ye ſee, as to refuſe a good thing when 'tis offer'd me. No, I remember the old Saying, When the Aſs is given thee, run and take him by the Halter; and when good Luck knocks at thy Door, let him in, and keep him there. My Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid <hi>Carraſco,</hi> you have ſpoken like any Univerſity-Profeſſor: However truſt in Heav'ns Bounty, and the noble Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and he may not only give thee an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland, but even a Kingdom. One as likely as the other, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> and yet let me tell you, Mr. Batchelor, the Kingdom which my Maſter is to give me, you ſhan't find it thrown into an old Sack; for I have felt my own Pulſe, and find my ſelf ſound enough to rule Kingdoms and govern I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlands; I ha' told my Maſter as much before now. Have a Care <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid <hi>Carraſco,</hi> Honours change Manners; perhaps when you come to be a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour you will ſcarce know your own Mother. This, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> may happen to thoſe that were born in a Ditch, but not to thoſe whoſe Souls are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, as mine is, four Fingers thick with good old
<pb n="673" facs="tcp:54446:370"/>
Chriſtian Fat. No, do but think how good-condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd I be, and then you need not fear I ſhou'd do dirtily by any one. Grant it good Heaven, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote!</hi> we ſhall ſee when the Government comes, and methinks I have it already before my Eyes. After this he deſir'd the Batchelor, if he were a Poet, to oblige him with ſome Verſes on his deſign'd Departure from his Miſtreſs <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo,</hi> every Verſe to begin with one of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of her Name, ſo that joining every firſt Letter of every Verſe together, they might make <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo.</hi> The Batchelor told him, that though he were none of the famous Poets of <hi>Spain,</hi> who, they ſay, were but three and a half, he would endeavour to make that Acroſtick; though he was ſenſible this would be no eaſy Task, there being ſeventeen Letters in the Name; ſo that if he made four Stanzas of four Verſes apiece, there wou'd be a Letter too much; and if he made his Stanzas of five Lines, ſo as to make a double <hi>Decima</hi> or a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dondilla,</hi> there wou'd be three Letters too little; however he wou'd ſtrive to drown a Letter, and ſo take in the whole Name in ſixteen Verſes. Let it be ſo by any Means, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> for no Woman will believe that thoſe Verſes were made for her where her Name is not plainly to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern'd. After this 'twas agreed they ſhould ſet out within a Week. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> charg'd the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelor not to ſpeak a Word of all this, eſpecially to the Curate, Mr. <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Barber, his Niece, and his Houſe-keeper, leſt they ſhou'd obſtruct his honourable and valorous Deſign. <hi>Carraſco</hi> gave him his Word, and having deſir'd Don <hi>Quixote</hi> to ſend an Account of his good or bad Succeſs at his Conveniency, took his Leave, and left him; and <hi>Sancho</hi> went to get every thing ready for his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>

                        <p>THE Tranſlator of this Hiſtory, being come to this fifth Chapter, thinks fit to inform the Reader, that he holds it to be Apocryphal; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it introduces <hi>Sancho</hi> ſpeaking in another Style than could be expected from his ſlender Capacity, and ſaying things of ſo refin'd a Nature, that it ſeems impoſſible he cou'd know 'em. However, he thought himſelf oblig'd to render it in our Tongue, to maintain the Character of a faithful Tranſlator, and therefore he goes on in this manner.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sancho</hi> came home ſo Chearful and ſo Merry, that his Wife read his Joy in his Looks as far as ſhe cou'd ſee him. Being impatient to know the Cauſe, My Dear, cry'd ſhe, what makes you ſo Merry? I ſhou'd be more Merry, my Chuck, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> wou'd but Heaven ſo order it, that I were not ſo well pleas'd as I ſeem to be. You ſpeak Riddles Husband quoth ſhe; I don't know what you mean by ſaying, you ſhould be more merry if you were not ſo well pleas'd; for, tho' I am ſilly enough, I can't think a Man can take Pleaſure in not being Pleas'd. Look ye, <hi>Tereſa,</hi> quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I am Merry, becauſe, I am once more going to ſerve my Maſter Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> who is reſolv'd to have t'other Frolick, and go a hunting after Adventures, and I muſt go with him; for he needs muſt, whom the Devil drives.
<pb n="675" facs="tcp:54446:371"/>
What ſhould I lie ſtarving at home for? The Hopes of finding another Parcel of Gold like that we ſpent, rejoices the Cockles of my Heart: But then it grieves me to leave thee, and thoſe ſweet Babes of ours; and wou'd Heaven but be pleas'd to let me live at home dry-ſhod, in Peace and Quietneſs, without gadding over Hill and Dale, through Brambles and Briars (as Heaven might well do with ſmall Coſt, if it wou'd, and with no manner of Trouble, but only to be wiling it ſhould be ſo) why then 'tis a clear caſe that my Mirth wou'd be more firm and ſound, ſince my preſent Gladneſs is mingl'd with a Sorrow to part with thee. And ſo I think I have made out what I have ſaid, that I ſhould be Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier if I did not ſeem ſo well pleas'd. Look you, <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth the Wife, ever ſince you have been a Member of a Knight-Errant, you talk ſo round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Buſh, that no body can underſtand you. 'Tis enough, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that he underſtands me who underſtands all things; and ſo ſcatter no more Words about it, Spouſe. But be ſure you look carefully after <hi>Dapple</hi> for theſe three Days, that he may be in good Caſe, and fit to bear Arms; dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his Pittance, look out his Pannel and all his Harneſs, and let every thing be ſet to rights; for we are not going to a Wedding, but to roam about the World, and to make our Party good with Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, and Dragons, and Hobgoblins, and to hear nothing but hiſſing, and yelling, and roaring, and howling, and bellowing; all which wou'd yet be but Sugar-Plumbs, if we were not to meet with <hi>Yangueſian</hi> Carriers, and Inchanted <hi>Moors.</hi> Nay, as for that, Husband, quoth <hi>Tereſa,</hi> I am apt enough to think you Squires-Errant don't eat their Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's Bread for nothing, and therefore it ſhall be my daily Prayer that you may quickly be freed from that plaguy Trouble. Troth, Wife, quoth

                           <hi>Sancho,</hi> were not I in hopes to ſee my ſelf e'er it be long, Governour of an Iſland, o' my Conſcience I ſhou'd drop down Dead on the Spot. Not ſo, my Chicken, quoth the Wife, <hi>Let the Hen live, though it be with Pip.</hi> Do thou live, and let all the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments in the World go to the Devil. Thou cam'ſt out of thy Mother's Belly without Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thou haſt liv'd hitherto without Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and thou may'ſt be carry'd to thy long Home without Government, when it ſhall pleaſe the Lord. How many People in this World live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Government, yet do well enough, and are well look'd upon? There's no Sauce in the World like Hunger, and as the Poor never want that, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways eat with a good Stomach. But look ye, my Precious, if it ſhou'd be thy good Luck to get a Government, prithee don't forget your Wife and Children. Take notice that little <hi>Sancho</hi> is already full fifteen, and 'tis thought fit he go to School, if his Uncle the Abbot mean to leave him ſomething in the Church. Then there's <hi>Mary Sancha,</hi> your Daughter; I dare ſay the Burden of Wedlock will never be the Death of her, for I ſhrewdly gueſs, ſhe longs as much for a Husband, as you do for a Government; and when all comes to all, better my Daughter ill Marry'd, than well kept. I good footh! Wife, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> if it be Heaven's bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Will that I get any thing by Government, I'll ſee and Match <hi>Mary Sancha</hi> ſo well, that ſhe ſhall, at leaſt, be call'd my Lady. By no means, Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, cry'd the Wife, let her Match with her Match: If from clouted Shooes you ſet her upon high Heels, and from her Coarſe Ruſſet Coat you put her into a Fardingale, and from plain <hi>Moll</hi> and <hi>Thee</hi> and <hi>Thou,</hi> go to call her Madam, and your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſhip, the poor Girl won't know how to behave herſelf, but will every foot make a Thouſand Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:54446:372"/>
and ſhew her home-ſpun Country-Breeding. Tuſh! Fool, anſwer'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> 'twill be but two or three Years Prenticeſhip; and then you'll ſee how ſtrangely ſhe'll alter, your Ladyſhip and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of State will become her, as if they had been made for her; and ſuppoſe they ſhould not, what is it to any Body? Let her but be a Lady, and let what will happen. Good <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth the Wife, don't look above your ſelf; I ſay, keep to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, that ſays, Birds of a Feather flock together. 'Twould be a fine thing, e'trow! for us to go and throw away our Child on one of your Lordlings, or Right Worſhipfuls, who, when the Toy ſhou'd take him in the Head, would find new Names for her, and call her Country <hi>Joan,</hi> Plough-Jobber's Bearn, and Spinſter's Web. No, no, Husband, I han't bred the Girl up as I ha' done, to throw her away at that rate, I'll warrant ye. Do thee but bring home Money, and leave me to get her a Husband. Why, there's <hi>Lope Tocho,</hi> old <hi>John Tocho</hi>'s Son, a hale jolly young Fellow, and one whom we all know, I have obſerv'd he caſts a Sheep's Eye at the Wench, he's one of our Inches, and will be a good Match for her; then we ſhall always have her under our Wings, and be all as one, Father and Mother, Children and Grand-Children, and Heaven's Peace and Bleſſing will always be with us. But ne'er talk to me of Marrying her at your Courts, and Great Men's Houſes, where ſhe'll underſtand no body, and no body will underſtand her. Why, thou Beaſt, cry'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> thou Wife for <hi>Barrabas,</hi> why doſt thou hinder me from Marrying my Daughter to one that will get me Grand-Children that may he call'd your Honour and your Lordſhip? Han't I always heard my Betters ſay, That he who will not when he may, when he will he ſhall have nay? When good Luck is knocking at our Door, is't fit
<pb n="678" facs="tcp:54446:373"/>
to ſhut him out? No, no, let us make Hay while the Sun ſhines, and ſpread our Sails before this proſperous Gale. [This Mode of Locution, and the following Huddle of Reflexions and Apoph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegms, ſaid to have been ſpoken by <hi>Sancho,</hi> made the Tranſlator of this Hiſtory ſay, he held this Chapter Apocryphal.] Canſt thou not perceive, thou ſenſeleſs Animal, ſaid <hi>Sancho</hi> going on, that I ſhall venture over Head and Ears to light on ſome good gainful Government, that may free our Ancles from the Clog of Neceſſity, and Marry <hi>Mary Sancha</hi> to whom I pleaſe? Then thoul't ſee how Folks will call thee my Lady <hi>Tereſa Pança,</hi> and thou'lt ſit in the Church with thy Carpets and Cuſhions, and lean and loll in State, though the beſt Gentlewoman in the Town burſt with Spight and Envy. No, no, remain as you are, ſtill in the ſame Poſture, neither higher nor lower, like a Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the Hangings Go to, let's have no more of this, little <hi>Sancha</hi> ſhall be a Counteſs in ſpight of thy Teeth, I ſay. Well, well, Husband, quoth the Wife, have a Care what you ſay, for I fear me theſe high Kicks will be my <hi>Molly</hi>'s undoing. Yet do what you will, make her a Dutcheſs or a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, but I'll never give my Conſent. Look ye, Yoke-Fellow, for my part, I ever lov'd to ſee eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing upon the ſquare, and can't abide to ſee Folks take upon them when they ſhould not. I was Chriſten'd plain <hi>Tereſa,</hi> without any Fiddle-faddle, or Addition of Madam, or your Ladyſhip. My Father's Name was <hi>Caſcajo;</hi> and becauſe I Married you, they call me <hi>Tereſa Pança,</hi> though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed by right I ſhould have been call'd <hi>Tereſa Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cajo:</hi> But where the Kings are, there are the Laws; and I am e'en contented with that Name without a Flouriſh before it, to make it longer and more tedious than 'tis already; neither will I make my
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:54446:373"/>
ſelf any body's Laughing-ſtock. I'll give 'em no Cauſe to cry, (when they ſee me go like a Counteſs, or a Governour's Madam,) Look, look, how Madam Hog-waſh ſtruts along! 'Twas but t'other Day ſhe'd tug ye a Diſtaff, capp'd with Hemp, from Morning till Night, and would go to Maſs with her Coat over her Head for want of a Hood; yet now look how ſhe goes in her Fardingale; and her rich Trimmings and Fallals, no leſs than a whole Tradeſman's Shop about her mangy Back, as if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very body did not know her. No, Husband, if it pleaſe Heaven but to keep me in my ſeven Senſes, or my five, or as many as I have, I'll take Care to tye up People's Tongues from ſetting me out at this rate. You may go, and be a Governour, or an Iſlander, and look as big as Bull-Beef an you will; but by my Grand-mother's Daughter, neither I nor my Girl will budge a Foot from our Thatch'd Houſe. Better a broken Leg than a Crack in my Credit; and let them ſeek for Jointures who can't work with their ten Fingers. March you and your Don <hi>Quixote</hi> together, to your Iſlands and Adventures, and leave us here to our ſorry For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: I'll warrant you Heaven will better it, if we live as we ought to do. I wonder tho' who made him a Don; neither his Father nor his Grandſire ever had that Feather in their Caps. The Lord help thee, Woman! quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> what a heap of Stuff haſt thou twiſted together without Head or Tail! What have thy <hi>Caſcajo's,</hi> thy Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingales and Fallals, thy old Saws, and all this Tale of a roaſted Horſe, to do with what I have ſaid? Hark thee me, Gammer Addlepate, (for I can find no better Name for thee, ſince thou'rt ſuch a blind Buzzard as to miſs my Meaning, and ſtand in thy own Light) ſhould I ha' told thee that my Girl was to throw herſelf Head foremoſt from the
<pb n="680" facs="tcp:54446:374"/>
top of ſome Steeple, or to trot about the World like a Gypſie, or, as the Infanta <hi>Donna Urraca</hi> did, then thou might'ſt have ſome Reaſon not to be of my Mind. But if in the twinkling of an Eye, and while one might toſs a Pan-cake, I clap you a Don and a Ladyſhip upon the back of her; if I fetch her out of her Straw, to ſit under a Stately Bed's-Teaſter; and ſquat her down on more Velvet-Cuſhions, then all the <hi>Almohada</hi>'s of <hi>Morocco</hi> had <hi>Moors</hi> in their Generation, why ſhould'ſt thou be againſt it, and not be pleas'd with what pleaſes me? Shall I tell you why, Husband, anſwer'd <hi>Tereſa;</hi> 'tis becauſe of the Proverb, <hi>He that covers thee, diſcovers thee.</hi> A poor Man is ſcarce minded, but every one's Eyes will ſtare upon the Rich; and if that rich Man has formerly been Poor, this ſets others a grumbling and back-biting; and your evil Tongues will ne'er ha' done, but ſwarm about the Streets like Bees, and buz their Stories into People's Ears. Look you, <hi>Tereſa,</hi> ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> mind what I ſay to thee, I'll tell thee things that perhaps thou ne'er heard'ſt of in thy Life: Nor do I ſpeak of my own Head, but what I heard from that good Father who Preach'd i' our Town all laſt <hi>Lent.</hi> He told us, if I an't miſtaken, that all thoſe things which we ſee before our Eyes do appear, hold and exiſt in our Memories much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and with a greater ſtreſs than things paſs'd. [All theſe Reaſons which are here offer'd by <hi>Sancho,</hi> are another Argument to perſwade the Tranſlator to hold this Chapter for Apocryphal, as exceeding the Capacity of <hi>Sancho.</hi>] From thence it ariſes, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> going on, that when we happen to ſee a Perſon well Dreſs'd, richly Equipp'd, and with a great Train of Servants, we find our ſelves mov'd and prompted to pay him Reſpect, in a manner, in ſpight of our Teeth, tho' at that very moment our
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:54446:374"/>
Memory makes us call to remembrance ſome low Circumſtances, in which we had ſeen that Perſon before. Now this Ignominy, be it either by reaſon of his Poverty, or mean Parentage, as 'tis already paſs'd, is no more, and only that which we ſee before our Eyes remains. So then, if this Perſon, whom Fortune has rais'd to that heighth out of his former Obſcurity, by his Father's means, be well-bred, Generous and Civil to all Men, and does not affect to vye with thoſe that are of noble Deſcent, aſſure thy ſelf, <hi>Tereſa,</hi> no body will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what he was, but look upon him as what he is, unleſs it be your envious Spirits, from whoſe Taunts no proſperous Fortune can be free. I don't underſtand you, Husband, quoth <hi>Tereſa;</hi> even follow your own Inventions, and don't puzzle my Brains with your Harangues and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricks. If y'are ſo devolv'd to do as ye ſay — Reſolv'd, you ſhou'd ſay, Wife, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> and not devolv'd. Prithee, Husband, ſaid <hi>Tereſa,</hi> let's ha' no Words about that Matter: I ſpeak as Heaven's pleas'd I ſhou'd; and for hard Words, I give my ſhare to the Curate. All I have to ſay now, is this; if you hold ſtill in the Mind of being a Governour, pray e'en take your Son <hi>Sancho,</hi> along with you; and henceforth train him up to your Trade of Governing; for 'tis but fitting that the Son ſhould be brought up to the Father's Calling. When once I am a Governour, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I'll ſend for him by the Poſt, and I'll ſend thee Money withal; for I dare ſay, I ſhall want none; there never wants thoſe that will lend Governours Money when they have none.

However, I tell you again, e'en follow your own Inventions; you Men will be Maſters, and we poor Women are born to bear the clog of Obedience, tho' our Husbands have no more Senſe than a Cuckoo.

                        <p>WHile <hi>Sancho Pança,</hi> and his Wife <hi>Tereſa Caſcajo,</hi> had the foregoing impertinent Dialogue, Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Niece and Houſe-keeper were not idle, gueſſing by a thouſand Signs that the Knight intended a Third Sally. Therefore they endeavour'd by all poſſible means to divert him from his fooliſh Deſign; but all to no purpoſe, for this was but Preaching to a Rock, and Hammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cold ſtubborn Steel. But among other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:54446:375"/>
in ſhort, Sir, quoth the Houſe-keeper, if you will not be Rul'd, but will needs run wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring over Hill and Dale, like a ſtray Soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Heaven and Hell, ſeeking for Miſchief, for ſo I may well call the hopeful Adventures which you go about, I'll never leave complaining to Heaven and the King, till there's a ſtop put to't ſome way or other. What Anſwer Heaven will vouchſafe to give thee, I know not, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> neither can I tell what return his Majeſty will make to thy Petition; this I know, that were I King, I would excuſe my ſelf from anſwering the infinite Number of impertinent Memorials that diſturb the Repoſe of Princes. I tell thee, Woman, among the many other Fatigues which Royalty ſuſtains, 'tis one of the greateſt to be oblig'd to hear every one, and to give Anſwer to all People. Therefore pray trouble not his Majeſty with any thing concerning me. But, pray Sir, tell me, reply'd ſhe, are there not a many Knights in the King's Court? I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> that for the Ornament, the Grandeur, and the Pomp of Royalty, many Knights are, and ought to be maintain'd there. Why then, ſaid the Woman, would it not be better for your Worſhip to be one of thoſe brave Knights, who ſerve the King their Maſter on Foot in his Court. Hear me, Sweet-heart, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> all Knights cannot be Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, nor can all Courtiers be Knight-Errants. There muſt be of all ſorts in the World; and though we were all to agree in the common Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of Knights, yet there would be a great difference between the one and the other. For your Courtiers, without ſo much as ſtirring out of their Chambers, or the Shade and Shelter of the Court, can journey over all the Univerſe in a
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:54446:376"/>
Map, without the Expence and Fatigue of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling, the Heat, the Cold, the Hunger and the Thirſt; while we, who are the true Knight-Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, Expos'd to thoſe Extremities, and all the Inclemencies of Heaven, by Night and by Day, on Foot as well as on Horſe-back, meaſure the whole ſurface of the Earth with our own Feet. Nor are we only acquainted with the Pictures of our Enemies, but with their very Perſons, ready upon all Occaſions and at all Times to engage 'em, without ſtanding upon Trifles, or the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of meaſuring Weapons, ſtripping, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining whether our Opponents have any holy Relicks or other ſecret Charms about 'em, whether the Sun be duly divided, or any other punctilios and circumſtances obſerv'd among private Dueliſts; things which thou underſtandeſt not, but I do; And muſt further let thee know, that the true Knight-Errant, though he meet ten Giants, whoſe tall aſpiring Heads not only touch but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-top the Clouds, each of 'em ſtalking with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Legs like huge Towers, their ſweeping Arms like Maſts of Mighty Ships, their ſtaring Eyes like large Mill-wheels, and glowing like Fiery Furnaces; yet is he ſo far from being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to meet them, that he muſt Encounter them with a Gentle Countenance, and an undaunted Courage, Aſſail them, Cloſe with them, and if poſſible, Vanquiſh and Deſtroy 'em all in an inſtant; nay, though they came arm'd with the Scales of a certain Fiſh, which they ſay is harder then Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, and inſtead of Swords had dreadful Sabres of keen Damask or Steel, or mighty Maces with Points of the ſame Metal, as I have ſeen them more than twice I have condeſcended to tell thee thus much, that thou may'ſt ſee the vaſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between Knights and Knights; and I
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:54446:376"/>
think 'twere to be wiſh'd that all Princes knew ſo far how to make the Diſtinction, as to give the Preheminence to this firſt ſpecies of Knight-Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, among whom there have been ſome whoſe Fortitude has not only been the Defence of our Kingdom, but of many more, as we read in their Hiſtories. Ah! Sir, ſaid the Niece, have a care what you ſay; all the Stories of Knight-Errants are nothing but a pack of Lies and Fables, and if they are not burnt, they ought at leaſt to wear a Sanbenito, the Badge of Hereſy, or ſome other mark of Infamy, that the World may know 'em to be wicked, and perverters of good Manners. Now by the powerful ſuſtainer of my Being, cry'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> wert thou not ſo nearly related to me, wert thou not my own Siſter's Daughter, I would take ſuch Revenge for the Blaſphemy thou haſt uttered, as would reſound thro' the whole Univerſe. Who ever heard of the like Impudence! That a young Baggage, who ſcarce knows her Bobbins from a Bodkin, ſhou'd preſume to put in her Wood, and Cenſure the Hiſtories of Knight-Errants! What would Sir <hi>Amadis</hi> have ſaid, had he heard this! But he undoubtedly would have forgiven thee, for he was the moſt Courteous and Complaiſant Knight of his Time, eſpecially to the fair Sex, being a great Protector of Damſels; but thy Words might have reach'd the Ears of ſome, that would have Sacrific'd thee to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation; for all Knights are not poſſeſs'd of Civility or good Nature, ſome are Rough and Revengeful; and neither are all thoſe that aſſume the Name, of a Diſpoſition ſuitable to the Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſome indeed were of the right Stamp, but others are either Counterfeit, or of ſuch an Allay as cannot bear the Touch-ſtone, though they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sight. Inferiour Mortals there are, who
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:54446:377"/>
aim at Knighthood, and ſtrain to reach the height of Honour; and High-born Knights there are, who ſeem fond of groveling in the Duſt, and being loſt in the Crowd of inferiour Mortals. The firſt raiſe themſelves by Ambition or by Vertue, the laſt debaſe themſelves by Negligence or by Vice; ſo that there is need of a diſtinguiſhing Underſtanding to judge between theſe two ſorts of Knights, ſo near ally'd in Name, and ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in Actions. Bleſs me! dear Uncle, cry'd the Niece, that you ſhould know ſo much, as to be able if there was Occaſion to get up into a Pulpit, or Preach<note n="*" place="bottom">A common thing in <hi>Spain</hi> for the Fryars, in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary fit of Zeal, to preach in any part of the Street or Market-Place.</note> in the Streets, and yet be ſo ſtrangely miſtaken, ſo groſly blind of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, as to fancy a Man of your Years and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity can be ſtrong and Valiant, that you can ſet every thing right, and force ſtubborn Malice to bend, when you your ſelf ſtoop beneath the Burden of Age, and what's yet more odd, that you are a Knight, when 'tis well known, you are none? For tho' Gentlemen may be Knights, a poor Gentleman can't purchace a Knight-hood. Therefore you ſay well, Niece, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> and as to to this laſt Obſervation, I could tell you things that you would admire at con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Families; but becauſe I will not mix Sacred things with Profane, I wave the Diſcourſe. However, liſten both of you, and for your further Inſtruction know, that all the Lineages and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcents of Mankind, are reduceable to theſe four Heads; Firſt, of thoſe, who like a Pyramid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd, from a very ſmall and obſcure beginning,
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:54446:377"/>
have rais'd themſelves to a ſpreading and prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Magnitude, of which the Family of the <hi>Ottomans</hi> is an Inſtance, while they derive the greatneſs of their preſent Power and Empire from the baſe and groveling beginning of a poor groveling Shepherd. A Second, are the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-part to this, whoſe Honours from large Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, have dwindl'd into leſs compaſs, and at laſt been extenuated till vaniſh'd into nothing, of which there is an infinite number of Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; for all your <hi>Egyptian</hi> Monarchs, your <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi> and <hi>Ptolemies,</hi> your <hi>Caeſars</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all the Swarm (if I may uſe that Name) of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs, Princes and Potentates, <hi>Medes, Aſſyrians, Perſians, Greeks</hi> and <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and all theſe migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty things are ended in a Point; the ſhadow of their greatneſs ſerves now only to obſcure their mean Succeſſors, who are loſt in the ignoble Crowd of vulgar Mortals. A third ſort there are, who, deriving their greatneſs from a Noble Spring, ſtill preſerve the Dignity and Character of their original Splendour. The laſt is, of thoſe whoſe Beginning, Continuance and Ending, are Mean, and altogether Obſcure, ſuch are the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People, which I hate to mention, being only the Lumber and Ballaſt of the World, and only thrown in as Ciphers to encreaſe the general Summ, their utmoſt Attempts deſerving no further Renown nor Elogy. Now, my good natur'd Souls, you may at leaſt draw this reaſonable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference from what I have ſaid of this promiſcuous diſpenſation of Honours, and this uncertainty and confuſion of Deſcent, That Vertue, Wealth, and Liberality in the preſent Poſſeſſor, are the moſt juſt and undiſputable Titles to Nobility; for the advantages of Pedigree without theſe qualifications, ſerve only to make Vice more conſpicuous. The
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:54446:378"/>
great Man that is Vicious, will be greatly Vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the rich Miſer is only a covetous Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar; for, not he who poſſeſſes, but that ſpends and enjoys his Wealth, is the rich and the happy Man; nor he neither who barely ſpends, but who does it with Diſcretion. The poor Knight indeed, cannot ſhew he is one by his Magnificence, but yet by his Vertue, Affability, Civility, and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Behaviour, he may diſplay the chief In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients that enter into the Compoſitions of Knight-hood; and though he cannot claim Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality, wanting Riches to ſupport it, his Charity may recompence that Defect; for an Alms of two Maravedis cheerfully beſtow'd upon an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent Beggar, by a Man in poor Circumſtances, ſpeaks him as Liberal as the larger Donative of a Vain-glorious Rich-man before a Fawning Crowd. Theſe Accompliſhments will always ſhine thro' the Clouds of Fortune, and at laſt break through 'em with Splendor and Applauſe. There are two paths to Dignity and Wealth, Arts and Arms. Arms I have choſen, and the Influence of the Planet <hi>Mars</hi> that preſided at my Nativity, led me to that adventurous Road. So that all your At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to ſhake my Reſolution are in vain; for in ſpight of all Mankind, I will purſue what Heaven has fated, Fortune ordain'd, what Reaſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, and (which is more) what my Inclination demands. I am ſenſible of the many Troubles and Dangers that attend the proſecution of Knight-Errantly, but I alſo know what infinite Honours and Rewards are the conſequence of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. The path of Vertue is narrow, and the way of Vice eaſie and open; but the difference in the end is as conſiderable. The latter is a broad Road indeed, and down-hill all the way, but Death and Contempt are always met at the end of
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:54446:378"/>
the Journey; whereas the former leads to Glory and Life, not a Life that ſoon muſt have an end, but an immortal Being. For I know, as our great<note n="*" place="bottom">

                        <p>THE Houſe-keeper no ſooner ſaw her Maſter and <hi>Sancho</hi> lock'd up together, but ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſurmis'd the Drift of their cloſe Conference, and concluding that no leſs than Villanous Knight-Errantry would prove the Reſult of this private Interview, ſhe flung her Veil over her Head, and quite caſt down with Sorrow and Vexation, trudg'd away to ſeek <hi>Sampſon Carraſco,</hi> the Batchelor of Arts; depending on his Wit and Eloquence, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade his Friend Don <hi>Quixote</hi> from his frantick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. She found him walking in the Yard of his Houſe, and fell preſently on her Knees before him in a cold Sweat, and with all the Marks of a diſorder'd Mind. What's the Matter, Woman, ſaid he, (ſomewhat ſurpriz'd at her Poſture and Confuſion) what has befallen you, that you look as if you were ready to give up the Ghoſt? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſaid ſhe, dear Sir, but that my Maſter's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting, he's departing, that's moſt certain. How! cry'd <hi>Carraſco.</hi> What d'you mean? Is his Soul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting out of his Body? No, anſwer'd the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but all his Wits are quite and clean depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He means to be Gadding again into the wide World, and is upon the Spur now the third Time to hunt after Ventures, as he calls 'em, though I don't know why he calls thoſe Chances ſo. The
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:54446:379"/>
firſt time he was brought home was athwart an Aſs, and almoſt cudgel'd to pieces. T'other Bout he was forc'd to ride home in a Waggon, coop'd up in a Cage, where he would make us believe he was Inchanted; and the poor Soul look'd ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, that the Mother that bore him would not have known the Child of her Bowels; ſo meager, wan, and wither'd, and his Eyes ſo ſunk and hid in the utmoſt nook and corner of his Brain, that I am ſure I ſpent about ſix hundred Eggs to cocker him up again; ay, and more too, as Heaven and all the World's my Witneſs, and the Hens that laid 'em can't deny it. That I believe ſaid the Batchelor, for your Hens are ſo well bred, ſo fat and ſo good, that they won't ſay one thing and think another for the World. But is this all? Has no other ill Luck befaln you, beſides this of your Maſter's intended Ramble? No other, Sir, quoth ſhe. Then trouble your Head no farther, ſaid he, but get you home, and as you go, ſay me the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of St <hi>Apollonia,</hi> if you know it, then get me ſome warm Bit for Breakfaſt, and I'll come to you preſently, and you ſhall ſee Wonders. Dear me, quoth ſhe, the Prayer of St. <hi>Polonia!</hi> Why, 'tis on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good for the Tooth-ach, but his Ailing lies in his Skull. Gammer, ſaid he, don't diſpute with me: I know what I ſay. Have I not commenc'd Batchelour of Arts at <hi>Salamanca,</hi> and do you think I have my Degree for nothing? With that away ſhe goes, and he went preſently to find the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, to conſult with him about what ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd in due Time.</p>
                        <p>When <hi>Sancho</hi> and his Maſter were lock'd up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Room, there paſs'd ſome Diſcourſe between them, of which the Hiſtory gives a very punctual and impartial Account. Sir, quoth <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> to his Maſter, I have at laſt reluc'd my Wife,
<pb n="692" facs="tcp:54446:380"/>
to let me go with your Worſhip where-ever you'll have me. Reduc'd, you would ſay, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and not reluc'd. Look you, Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> if I an't miſtaken, I have wiſh'd you once or twice not to ſtand correcting my Words, if you underſtand my Meaning: If you don't, why then do but ſay to me, <hi>Sancho,</hi> Devil, or what you pleaſe, I underſtand thee not; and if I don't make out my Meaning plainly, then take me up; for I am ſo forcible — I underſtand you not, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote</hi> interrupting him, for I can't gueſs the Meaning of your <hi>Forcible.</hi> Why, ſo Forcible, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> is as much as to ſay, Forcible. That is, I am ſo and ſo as it were. Leſs and leſs do I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thee, ſaid the Knight. Why then, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> there's an end of the Matter, it muſt e'en ſtick there for me, for I can ſpeak no better. Oh! now, quoth Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> I fancy I gueſs your Meaning, you mean Docible, I ſuppoſe, implying that you are ſo ready and apprehenſive, that you will preſently obſerve what I ſhall teach you. I'll lay an even Wager now, ſaid the Squire, you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood me well enough at firſt, but you had a Mind to put me out, meerly to hear me put your fine Words out-a-joint. That may be, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> but prithee tell me, what ſays <hi>Tereſa?</hi> Why, an't pleaſe you, quoth <hi>Sancho, Tereſa</hi> bids me make ſure Work with your Worſhip, and that we may have leſs Talking and more Doing; that 'tis good to be certain; that Paper ſpeaks when Beards never wag; that a Bird in Hand is worth two in the Buſh. One <hi>Hold-faſt</hi> is better than two <hi>I'll give thee;</hi> and I ſay a Woman's Counſel is not worth much, yet he that deſpiſes it, is no wiſer than he ſhould be — I believe ſo too, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> but pray good <hi>Sancho,</hi> proceed; for thou art in an excellent Strain; thou talk'ſt moſt ſententiouſly to Day.

                           <hi>Sancho,</hi> as you better know your-ſelf than I do, that we're all mortal Men, here to Day and gone to Morrow; as ſoon goes the young Lamb to the Spit, as the old Weather; no Man can tell the Length of his Days; for Death is deaf, and when he knocks at the Door, Mercy on the Porter. He's in Poſt haſte, neither fair Words nor foul, Crowns, nor Mitres can ſtay him, as the Report goes, and as we are told from the Pulpit. All this I grant, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote:</hi> But what would you infer from hence? Why, Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> all I would be at is, that your Worſhip allow me ſo much a<note n="*" place="bottom">The Cuſtom of <hi>Spain</hi> is to pay their Servants Wages by the Month.</note> Month for my Wages, whilſt I ſtay with you, and that the aforeſaid Wages be paid me out of your Eſtate. For I'll truſt no longer to Rewards, that mayhaps may come late, and mayhaps not at all. I'd be glad to know what I get, be 't more or leſs. A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in one's own Pocket, is better than much in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Man's Purſe. 'Tis good to keep a Neſt-Egg. Every little makes a mickle; while a Man gets he never can loſe. Should it happen indeed, that your Worſhip ſhould give me this ſame Iſland, which you promis'd me, though 'tis what I dare not ſo much as hope for, why then I an't ſuch an ungrateful, nor ſo unconſcionable a Muck-worm, but that I am willing to ſtrike off upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, for what Wages I receive, Cantity for Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity. Would not Quantity have been better than Cantity, ask'd Don <hi>Quixote?</hi> ho! I underſtand you now, cry'd <hi>Sancho?</hi> I dare lay a Wager I ſhould have ſaid Quantity and not Cantity; but no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for that, ſince you knew what I meant. Yes, <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth the Knight, I have div'd to the very
<pb n="694" facs="tcp:54446:381"/>
bottom of your Thought, and underſtand now the aim of all your numerous ſhot of Proverbs. Look you, Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> I ſhou'd never ſcruple to pay thee Wages, had I any Example to warrant ſuch a Practice. Nay, could I find the leaſt glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Precedent thro' all the Books of Chivalry that ever I read, for any Yearly or Monthly Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, your Requeſt ſhould be granted. But I have read all, or the greateſt part of the Hiſtories of Knight-Errants, and find that all their Squires depended purely on the Favour of their Maſters, for a Subſiſtence; till by ſome ſurprizing turn in the Knight's Fortune, the Servants were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd to the Government of ſome Iſland, or ſome equivalent Gratuity, at leaſt they had Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and a Title conferr'd on 'em as a Reward. Now Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> if you will depend upon theſe hopes of Preferment, and return to my Service, 'tis well; if not, get you home, and tell your Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent Wife, that I will not break through all the Rules and Cuſtoms of Chivalry, to ſatisfy her ſordid Diffidence and yours; and ſo let there be no more words about the Matter, but let us part Friends; and remember this, that if there be Vetches in my Dove-houſe, 'twill want no Pigeons. Good Arrears are better than ill Pay; and a Fee in Reverſion is better than a Farm in Poſſeſſion. Take notice too, there's Proverb for Proverb, to let you know that I can pour out a Volley of 'em as well as you. In ſhort, if you will not go along with me upon Courteſy, and run the ſame For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune with me, Heav'n be with you and make you a Saint; I do not queſtion but I ſhall get me a Squire, more Obedient, more Careful, and leſs Saucy and Talkative than you.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sancho</hi> hearing his Maſter's firm Reſolution, 'twas cloudy weather with him in an inſtant, he
<pb n="695" facs="tcp:54446:381"/>
was ſtruck dumb with Diſappointment, and down ſunk at once his Heart to his Girdle, for he verily thought he could have brought him to any terms, through a vain opinion that the Knight would not for the World go without him. While he was thus dolefully bury'd in Thought, in came <hi>Sampſon Carraſco</hi> and the Niece, very eager to hear the Batchelor's Arguments, to diſſwade Don <hi>Quixote</hi> from his intended Sally. But <hi>Sampſon,</hi> who was a rare Comedian, preſently embracing the Knight, and beginning in a high ſtrain, ſoon diſappointed her. O Flower of Chivalry, cry'd he, refulgent glory of Arms, living Honour and Mirrour of our <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nation, may all thoſe who prevent the third Expedition which thy Heroick Spirit medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, he loſt the Labyrinth of their perverſe Deſires, and find no thread to lead 'em to their Wiſhes. Then turning to the Houſe-keeper, you have no need now to ſay the Prayer of St. <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> ſaid he, for I find it written in the Stars, that the Illuſtrious Champion muſt no longer delay the proſecution of Glory; and I ſhould injure my Conſcience, ſhou'd I preſume to diſſwade him from the Benefits that ſhall redound to Mankind by exerting the ſtrength of his formidable Arm, and the innate Vertues of his Heroick Soul. Alas! his Stay deprives the oppreſs'd Orphans of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, Damſels of a Deliverer, Champions of their Honour, Widows of an obliging Patron, and Marry'd Women of a vigorous Comforter; and delays a thouſand other important Exploits and Atchievements, which are the Duty, and neceſſary Conſequences of the honourable Order of Knight-Errantry. Go on then, my Graceful, my Valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> rather this very Day than the next, let your Greatneſs be upon the Wing, and if any thing be wanting towards the compleating
<pb n="696" facs="tcp:54446:382"/>
of your Equipage, I ſtand forth to ſupply you with my Life and Fortune, and ready, if it be thought expedient, to attend your Excellence as a Squire, an Honour which I am ambitious to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Well, <hi>Sancho,</hi> (ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> hearing this, and turning to his Squire) did I not tell thee I ſhould not want Squires; behold who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers me his Service, the moſt excellent Batchelor of Arts, <hi>Sampſon Carraſco,</hi> the perpetual Darling of the Muſes and Glory of the <hi>Salamanca</hi>-Schools, ſound and active of Body, patient of Labour, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ur'd to Abſtinence, ſilent in Misfortune, and in ſhort, endow'd with all the Accompliſhments that conſtitute a Squire. But forbid it Heav'n, that to indulge my private Inclinations I ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to weaken the whole Body of Learning, by removing from it ſo ſubſtantial a Pillar, ſo vaſt a Repoſitory of Sciences, and ſo eminent a Branch of the Liberal Arts. No, my Friend, remain thou another <hi>Sampſon</hi> in thy Country, be the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the delight of thy ancient Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; I ſhall content my ſelf with any Squire, ſince <hi>Sancho</hi> does not vouchſafe to go with me. I do, I do, (cry'd <hi>Sancho</hi> relenting with Tears in his Eyes) I do vouchſafe; it ſhall never be ſaid of <hi>Sancho Pança,</hi> no longer Pipe no longer Dance. Nor have I a heart of Flint, Sir; for all the World knows, and eſpecially our Town, what the whole Generation of the <hi>Pança</hi>'s has ever been: Beſides, I well know, and have already found by a many good Turns, and more good Words, that your Worſhip has had a good will towards me all along; and if I have done otherwiſe than I ſhould, in ſtanding upon Wages, or ſo, it was meerly to humour my Wife, who, when once ſhe's ſet upon a thing, ſtands digging and hammering at a Man like a Cooper at a Tub, till ſhe clinches the
<pb n="697" facs="tcp:54446:382"/>
Point. But hang it, I am the Husband, and will be her Husband, and ſhe's but a Wife, and ſhall be a Wife. None can deny but I am a Man every Inch of me, where-ever I am, and I will be a Man at home in ſpight of any Body; ſo that you've no more to do, but to make your Will and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but be ſure you make the Conveyance ſo firm, that it can't be rebuk'd, and then let's be gone as ſoon as you pleaſe, that Maſter <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Soul may be at Reſt; for he ſays his Conſcience won't let him be quiet, till he has ſet you upon another Journey thro' the World; and I here again offer my ſelf to follow your Worſhip, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to be Faithful and Loyal, as well, nay, and better than all the Squires that ever waited on Knight-Errants. The Batchelor was amaz'd to hear <hi>Sancho Pança</hi> expreſs himſelf after that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and though he had read much of him in the firſt part of his Hiſtory, he could not believe him to be ſo pleaſant a Fellow as he is there repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. But hearing him now talk of rebuking inſtead of revoking Teſtaments and Conveyances, he was induc'd to Credit all that was ſaid of him, and to conclude him one of the moſt ſolemn Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Age, nor could he imagine that the World ever ſaw before ſo extravagant a Couple as the Maſter and the Man.</p>
                        <p>Don <hi>Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> embrac'd, becoming as good Friends as ever, and ſo with the approbation of the Grand <hi>Carraſco,</hi> who was then the Knight's Oracle, it was decreed, that they ſhould ſet out at the expiration of three Days, in which time all Neceſſaries ſhould be provided, eſpecially a whole Helmet, which Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ſaid he was reſolv'd by all means to purchaſe. <hi>Sampſon</hi> offer'd him one which he knew he could eaſily get of a Friend, and which look'd more dull with the Mold and
<pb n="698" facs="tcp:54446:383"/>
Ruſt, than bright with the luſtre of the Steel. The Niece and the Houſe-keeper made a woful Out-cry, they tore their Hair, ſcratch'd their Faces, and howl'd like common Mourners at Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, lamenting the Knight's departure, as it had been his real Death, and Curſing <hi>Carraſco</hi> moſt unmercifully, though his Behaviour was the reſult of a contrivance Plotted between the Curate the Barber and himſelf. In ſhort, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> and his Squire having got all things in a readineſs, the one having pacify'd his Wife, and the other his Niece and Houſe-keeper, towards the Evening, without being ſeen by any Body but the Batchelor, who would needs accompany them about half a League from the Village, they ſet forward for <hi>Toboſo.</hi> The Knight mounted his <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> his truſty <hi>Dapple,</hi> his Wallet well ſtuff'd with Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and his Purſe with Money, which Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote</hi> gave him to defray Expences. At laſt <hi>Sampſon</hi> took his Leave, deſiring the Champion to give him from time to time an Account of his Succeſs, that according to the Laws of Friendſhip, he might ſympathize in his good or evil Fortune. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> made him a Promiſe, and then they parted; <hi>Sampſon</hi> went home, and the Knight and Squire continu'd their Journey for the great City of <hi>Toboſo.</hi>

                        <p>BBeſſed be the mighty <hi>Alla,</hi> ſays <hi>Hamet Benen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geli,</hi> at the beginning of his eighth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; bleſſed be <hi>Alla.</hi> Which Ejaculation he thrice repeated, in conſideration of the Bleſſing, that Don <hi>Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> had once more taken the Field again, and that from this Period the Readers of their delightful Hiſtory may date the Knight's Atchievements, and the Squire's Pleaſantries; and he entreats 'em to forget the former heroical Tranſactions of the wonderful Knight, and ſix their Eyes upon his future Exploits, which take Birth from his ſetting out for <hi>Toboſo,</hi> as the former began in the Fields of <hi>Montiel.</hi> Nor can ſo ſmall a Requeſt be thought unreaſonable, conſidering his performance in proſpect, which begins in this manner.</p>
                        <p>Don <hi>Quixote</hi> and his Squire were no ſooner part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Batchelor, but <hi>Rozinante</hi> began to neigh, and <hi>Dapple</hi> to bray; which both the Knight and the Squire interpreted as good Omens, and moſt fortunate Preſages of their ſucceſs; tho' the truth of the Story is, that as <hi>Dapple</hi>'s braying exceeded <hi>Rozinante</hi>'s neighing, <hi>Sancho</hi> concluded that his Fortune ſhou'd out-rival and eclipſe his Maſter's; which inference I will not ſay he drew from ſome Principles in Judicial Aſtrology, in which he was undoubtedly well grounded, tho'
<pb n="700" facs="tcp:54446:384"/>
the Hiſtory is ſilent in that particular; however 'tis recorded of him, that oftentimes upon the falling or ſtumbling of his Aſs, he wiſh'd he had not gone abroad that Day, and from ſuch acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents prognoſticated nothing but diſlocation of Joints, and breaking of Ribs, and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his fooliſh Character, this was no bad Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quixote</hi> to him, I find the approaching Night will overtake us, e'er we can reach <hi>Toboſo,</hi> where before I enter upon any Expedition, I am reſolv'd to pay my Vows, receive my Benediction, and take my Leave of the Peerleſs <hi>Dulcinea;</hi> being aſſur'd after that of happy Events, in the moſt dangerous Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; for nothing in this World inſpires a Knight-Errant with ſo much Valour, as the Smiles and favourable Aſpects of his Miſtreſs. I am of your Mind, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but I am afraid, Sir, you will hardly come at her, to ſpeak with her, at leaſt not meet her in a place where ſhe may give you her Bleſſing, unleſs ſhe throw it you over the Mud-Wall of the Yard, where I firſt ſaw her, when I carried her the news of your Mad Pranks, in the midſt of <hi>Sierra Morena.</hi> Mud-Wall, doſt thou ſay, cry'd Don <hi>Quixote!</hi> Miſtaken Fool, the Wall cou'd have no exiſtence but in thy muddy Underſtanding: 'Tis a meer Creature of thy dirty Fancy; for that never duly celebrated Paragon of Beauty and Gentility, was then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly in ſome Court, in ſome ſtately Gallery, or Walk, or as 'tis properly call'd in ſome ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and Royal Palace. It may be ſo, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> tho' ſo far as I can remember, it ſeem'd to me neither better nor worſe than a Mud-Wall. 'Tis no matter, reply'd the Knight, let us go thither; I will viſit my dear <hi>Dulcinea;</hi> let me but ſee her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tho' it be over a Mud-Wall, thro' a Chink of a
<pb n="701" facs="tcp:54446:384"/>
Cottage, or the Pales of a Garden, at a Lettice, or any where; which way ſoever the leaſt Beam from her bright Eyes reaches mine, it will ſo enlighten my Mind, ſo fortify my Heart, and invigorate every faculty of my Being, that no Mortal will be able to rival me in Prudence and Valour. Troth! Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> when I beheld that ſame Sun of a Lady, methought it did not ſhine ſo bright, as to caſt forth any Beams at all; but mayhaps the reaſon was, that the Duſt of the Grain ſhe was winnowing, rais'd a Cloud about her Face, and made her look ſomewhat dull. I tell thee again, Fool, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> thy Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination is duſty and foul; will it never be beaten out of thy ſtupid Brain, that my Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi> was winnowing? Are ſuch Exerciſes us'd by Perſons of her Quality, whoſe Recreations are always noble, and ſuch as diſplay an air of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſuitable to their Birth and Dignity? Can'ſt thou not remember the Verſes of our Poet, when he recounts the Employments of the four Nymphs at their Chryſtal-Manſions, when they advanc'd their Heads above the Streams of the lovely <hi>Tagus,</hi> and ſat upon the Graſs, working thoſe rich Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broideries, where Silk and Gold, and Pearl em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſs'd, were ſo curiouſly interwoven, and which that ingenious Bard ſo Artfully deſcribes? So was my Princeſs employ'd when ſhe bleſs'd thee with her ſight, but the envious malice of ſome baſe Necromancer faſcinated thy Sight, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents whatever is moſt grateful to me in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent and diſpleaſing Shapes. And this makes me fear, that if the Hiſtory of my Atchievements, which they tell me is in Print, has been written by ſome Magician who is no well-wiſher to my Glory, he has undoubtedly deliver'd many things with Partiality, miſrepreſented my Life, inſerting
<pb n="702" facs="tcp:54446:385"/>
a hundred falſhoods for one truth, and diverting himſelf with the relation of idle Stories, foreign from the purpoſe; and obnoxious to the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a true Hiſtory. Oh Envy, Envy! Thou gnawing worm of Virtue, and Spring of infinite Mischiefs! There is no other Vice, my <hi>Sancho,</hi> but pleads ſome pleaſure in its excuſe; but Envy is always attended by Diſguſt, Rancour, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting Rage. I am much of your Mind, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> and I think, in the ſame Book which Neighbour <hi>Carraſco</hi> told us he had read of our Lives, the Story makes bold with my Credit, and has handl'd it at a ſtrange rate, and has dragg'd it about the Kennels, as a body may ſay. Well, now as I'm an honeſt Man, I never ſpoke an ill Word of a Magician in my born Days; and I think they need not envy my Condition ſo much. The truth is, I am ſomewhat malicious; I have my roguiſh Tricks now and then; but I was ever counted more Fool than Knave for all that, and ſo indeed I was bred and born; and if there were nothing elſe in me but my Religion (for I firmly believe whatever our holy <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, and I hate the <hi>Jews</hi> mortally) theſe ſame Hiſtorians ſhould take pity o' me, and ſpare me a little in their Books. But let 'em ſay on to the end of the Chapter, naked I came into the World, and naked muſt go out. 'Tis all a caſe to <hi>Sancho,</hi> I can neither win nor loſe; and ſo they put me in their Books, and toſs my Name from Poſt to Pillar. I care not a Fig for the worſt they can ſay. What thou ſay'ſt, <hi>Sancho,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> puts me in mind of a Story. A celebrated Poet of our time wrote a very ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous and abuſive Lampoon upon all the Intriguing Ladies of the Court, forbearing to name one, as not being ſure whether ſhe deſerv'd to be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="703" facs="tcp:54446:385"/>
the Catalogue or no; but the Lady not finding herſelf there, was not a little affronted at the Omiſſion, and made a great Complaint to the Poet, asking him what he had ſeen in her, that he ſhou'd leave her out of his Liſt; deſiring him at the ſame time to enlarge his Satire and put her in, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to hear further from her. The Author o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd her Commands, and gave her a Character with a vengeance, and, to her great ſatisfaction, made her as famous for Infamy as any Woman a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Town. Such another ſtory is that of <hi>Diana</hi>'s Temple, one of the ſeven Wonders of the World, burnt by an ignoble Fellow meerly to eternize his Name; which, in ſpight of an Edict that enjoyn'd all People never to mention it, either by word of Mouth or in Writing, yet is ſtill known to have been <hi>Eroſtratus.</hi> The Story of the great Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth and a <hi>Roman</hi> Knight, upon a certain occaſion, is much the ſame. The Emperour had a great deſire to ſee the famous Temple once called the <hi>Pantheon,</hi> but now more happily, the Church of <hi>All Saints.</hi> 'Tis the only entire Edifice remaining of Heathen <hi>Rome,</hi> and that which beſt gives an Idea of the Glory and Magnificence of its great Founders. 'Tis built in the ſhape of a half Orange, of a vaſt Extent and very lightſom, tho' it admits no Light, but at one Window, or to ſpeak more properly at a round Aperture on the top of the Roof. The Emperor being got up thither, and looking down from the Brink upon the Fabrick, with a <hi>Roman</hi> Knight by him, who ſhew'd all the Beauties of that vaſt edifice; after they were gone from the place, ſays the Knight, addreſſing the Emperor, It came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Head a thouſand Times, Sacred Sir, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace your Majeſty, and caſt my ſelf with you from the top of the Church to the bottom, that I
<pb n="704" facs="tcp:54446:386"/>
might thus purchaſe an immortal Name. I thank you, ſaid the Emperor, for not doing it; and for the future I will give you no opportunity to put your Loyalty to ſuch a Teſt. Therefore I baniſh you my Preſence for ever, which done, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd ſome mighty Favour on him. I tell thee, <hi>Sancho,</hi> this deſire of Honour is a ſtrange bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thing. What doſt thou think made <hi>Horatius,</hi> arm'd at all points, plunge headlong from the Bridge into the Rapid <hi>Tyber?</hi> What prompted <hi>Curtius</hi> to leap into the profound flaming Gulph? What made <hi>Mutius</hi> burn his Hand? What forc'd <hi>Coeſar</hi> over the <hi>Rubicon,</hi> ſpight of all the Omens that diſſuaded his Paſſage? And to inſtance a more modern Example, what made the undaunted <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſink their Ships, when under the moſt Courteous <hi>Cortez,</hi> but that ſcorning the ſtale Honor of this ſo often Conquer'd World, they ſought a Maiden Glory in a new Scene of Victory? Theſe, and a multiplicity of other great Actions, are owing to the immediate thirſt and deſire of Fame, which Mortals expect as the proper Price and immortal Recompence of their great Actions. But we that are Chriſtian Catholick Knight-Errants, muſt fix our hopes upon a higher Reward, plac'd in the Eternal and Celeſtial Regions, where we may expect a permanent Honour and compleat Happineſs; not like the vanity of Fame, which at beſt is but the ſhadow of great Actions, and muſt neceſſarily vaniſh when deſtructive Time has eat away the Subſtance which it follow'd. So, my <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſince we expect a Chriſtian Reward, we muſt ſuit our Actions to the Rules of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. In Giants we muſt kill Pride and Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance: But our greateſt Foes, and whom we muſt chiefly combare, are within. Envy we muſt overcome by generoſity and nobleneſs of Soul: Anger by a repos'd and eaſy Mind; Riot and
<pb n="705" facs="tcp:54446:386"/>
Drowſineſs, by Vigilance and Temperance; Laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſneſs, by our inviolable Fidelity to thoſe who are Miſtreſſes of our Thoughts; and Sloth, by our indefatigable Peregrinations thro' the Univerſe, to ſeek occaſions of Military, as well as Chriſtian Honours. This, <hi>Sancho,</hi> is the Road to laſting Fame, and a good and honourable Renown. I underſtand paſſing well every Tittle you have ſaid, anſwer'd <hi>Sancho;</hi> but pray now, Sir, will you diſſolve me of one doubt, that's juſt come into my Head. Reſolve thou would'ſt ſay, <hi>Sancho,</hi> reply'd Don <hi>Quixote:</hi> Well, ſpeak, and I will endeavour to ſatisfy thee. Why then, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> pray tell me, theſe ſame <hi>Julys,</hi> and theſe <hi>Auguſts,</hi> and all the reſt of the famous Knights you talk of that are dead, where are they now? Without doubt, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> the Heathens are in Hell. The Chriſtians, if their Lives were anſwerable to their Profeſſion, are either in Purgatory or in Heaven. So far ſo good, ſaid <hi>Sancho;</hi> but pray tell me, the Tombs of theſe Lordlings, have they any Silver-Lamps ſtill burning before 'em, and are their Chappel-walls hung about with Crutches, Winding-ſheets, old Perriwigs, Legs and Wax-eyes, or with what are they hung? The Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the dead Heathens, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> were for the moſt part ſumptuous pieces of Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture. The Aſhes of <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> were depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited on the top of an Obeliſque, all of one Stone of a prodigious bigneſs, which is now called <hi>Aguglia di San Pietro.</hi> The Emperor <hi>Adrian</hi>'s Sepulchre was a vaſt Structure as big as an ordinary Village, and call'd <hi>Moles Adriani,</hi> and now the Caſtle of St. <hi>Angelo</hi> in <hi>Rome.</hi> Queen <hi>Artemiſia</hi> buried her Husband <hi>Mauſolus</hi> in ſo curious and magnificent a Pile, that his Monument was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted one of the ſeven Wonders of the World.
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:54446:387"/>
But none of theſe, nor any other of the Heathen Sepulchres, had any Winding-ſheets, or other Offering that might imply the Perſons interr'd were Saints. Thus far we are right, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> now, Sir, pray tell me, which is the greateſt wonder, to raiſe a dead Man, or kill a Giant? The anſwer is obvious, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> to raiſe a dead Man certainly. Then; Maſter, I have nick'd you, ſaith <hi>Sancho,</hi> for he that raiſes the Dead, makes the Blind ſee, the Lame walk, and the Sick healthy, who has Lamps burning Night and Day before his Sepulchre, and whoſe Chappel is full of Pilgrims, who adore his Relicks on their Knees; that Man I ſay has more Fame in this World and in the next, than any of your Heatheniſh Emperors or Knight-Errants e'er had, or will ever have. I grant it, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote.</hi> Very good, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I'll be with you anon. This Fame, theſe Gifts, theſe Rights, Pivileges, and what d'ye call 'em, the Bodies and Relicks of theſe Saints have; ſo that by the conſent and good liking of our Holy Mother the Church they have their Lamps, their Lights, their Winding-ſheets, their Crutches, their Pictures, their Heads of Hair, their Legs, their Eyes, and the Lord knows what, by which they ſtir up People's Devotion, and ſpread their Chriſtian Fame. Kings will vouchſafe to carry the Bodies of Saints or their Relicks on their Shoulders, they'll kiſs you the pieces of their Bones, and ſpare no coſt to ſet off and deck their Shrines and Chappels. And what of all this, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote?</hi> What's your Inference? Why, truly, Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that we turn Saints as faſt as we can, and that's the readieſt and cheapeſt way to get this ſame Honour you talk of. 'Twas but yeſterday or t'other day, or I can't tell when, I'm ſure 'twas not long ſince, that two poor bare-footed
<pb n="707" facs="tcp:54446:387"/>
Friars were Sainted, and you can't think what a croud of People there is to kiſs the Iron-Chains they wore about their Waſtes inſtead of Girdles, to humble the Fleſh. I dare ſay they are more reverenc'd than <hi>Orlandoſa</hi>'s Sword, that hangs in the Armory of our Sovereign Lord the King, whom Heaven grant long to Reign! So that for ought I ſee, better it is to be a Friar, tho' but of a beggarly Order, than a valiant Errant Knight; and a dozen or two of ſound Laſhes, well meant, and as well laid on, will obtain more of Heaven than two thouſand thruſts with a Lance; tho' they be given to Giants, Dragons, or Hobgoblins. All this is very true, reply'd Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> but all Men cannot he Friars; we have different Paths allotted us, to mount to the high Seat of Eternal Felicity. Chivalry is a Religious Order, and there are Knights in the fraternity of Saints in Heaven. However, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I have heard ſay there are more Friars there than Knight-Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants. That is, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> becauſe there is a greater number of Friars than of Knights. But are there not a great many Knights-Errant too? ſaid <hi>Sancho.</hi> There are many indeed, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> but very few that deſerve the Name. In ſuch Diſcourſes as theſe, the Knight and Squire paſs'd the night and the whole ſucceeding day, without encountering any occaſion to ſignalize themſelves, at which Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was very much diſguſted. At laſt, towards evening the next day, they diſcover'd the goodly City of <hi>Toboſo,</hi> which reviv'd the Knight's Spirits Wonderfully, but had a quite contrary Effect on his Squire, becauſe he did not know the Houſe where <hi>Dulcinea</hi> liv'd, no more than his Maſter. So that the one was mad till he ſaw her, and the other very melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick and diſturb'd in Mind becauſe he had
<pb n="708" facs="tcp:54446:388"/>
never ſeen her; nor did he know what to do, ſhou'd his Maſter ſend him to <hi>Toboſo.</hi> However, as Don <hi>Quixote</hi> would not make his Entry in the Day-time, they ſpent the Evening among ſome Oaks not far diſtant from the place, till the prefix'd moment came; then they enter'd the City, where they met with Adventures indeed.</p>

                        <p>THE ſable Night had ſpun out half her Courſe, when Don <hi>Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from a Hill, and enter'd <hi>Toboſo.</hi> A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Silence reign'd o'er all the Town, and all the Inhabitants were faſt aſleep and ſtretch'd out at their Eaſe. The Night was ſomewhat clear, though <hi>Sancho</hi> wiſh'd it dark, to hide his Maſter's Folly and his own. Nothing diſturb'd the general Tranquility, but now and then the Barking of Dogs, that wounded Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Ears, but more poor <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Heart. Sometimes an Aſs bray'd, Hogs grunted, Cats mew'd; which jarring Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Sounds was not a little augmented by the Stillneſs and Serenity of the Night, and fill'd the enamour'd Champion's Head with a thouſand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auſpicious Chimera's. However, turning to his Squire, My dear <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid he, ſhew me the Way to <hi>Dulcinea</hi>'s Palace, perhaps we ſhall find her ſtill awake. Body of me, cry'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> what Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
<pb n="709" facs="tcp:54446:388"/>
do you mean? When I ſaw her Highneſs ſhe was in a little paltry Cot. Perhaps, reply'd the Knight, ſhe was then retir'd into ſome Corner of the Palace, to divert her ſelf in Private with her Damſels, as great Ladies and Princeſſes ſometimes do. Well Sir, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſince it muſt be a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace whether I will or no, yet can you think this is a Time of Night to find the Gates open, or a ſeaſonable Hour to thunder at the Door, till we raiſe the Houſe and alarm the whole Town? Are we going to a Bawdy-houſe, think you, like your Wenchers, that can rap at a Door any Hour of the Night, and knock People up when they liſt? Let us once find the Palace, ſaid the Knight, and then I'll tell thee what we ought to do: But ſtay, either my Eyes delude me, or that lofty gloomy Structure which I diſcover yonder, is <hi>Dulcinea</hi>'s Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. Well, lead on Sir, ſaid the Squire; and yet though I were to ſee it with my Eyes and feel it with my ten Fingers, I ſhall believe it e'en as much as I believe 'tis now Noon-Day. The Knight led on, and having rode about two hundred Paces, came at laſt to the Building which he took for <hi>Dulcinea</hi>'s Palace; but found it to be the great Church of the Town. We are miſtaken <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid he, I find this is a Church. I ſee it is, ſaid the Squire; and I pray the Lord we have not found our Graves; for 'tis a plaguy ill Sign to haunt Church-yards at this Time of Night, eſpecially when I told you, if I an't miſtaken, that this Lady's Houſe ſtands in a little blind Alley, without any Thorough-fair. A Curſe on thy diſtemper'd Brain! cry'd Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote;</hi> where, Blockhead, where did'ſt thou ever ſee royal Edifices and Palaces built in a blind Alley without a Thorough-fair? Sir, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> every Country has its ſeveral Faſhions; and for ought you know they may build their great Houſes and
<pb n="710" facs="tcp:54446:389"/>
Palaces in blind Alleys at <hi>Toboſo:</hi> And therefore, good your Worſhip, let me alone to hunt up and down in what By-Lanes and Alleys I may ſtrike into; may hap in ſome Nook or Corner we may light upon this ſame Palace: Wou'd Old-Nick had it for me, for leading us ſuch a Jaunt, and plaguing a Body at this Rate. <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> ſpeak with greater Reſpect of my Miſtreſs's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns; be merry and wiſe, and do not throw the Helve after the Hachet. Cry Mercy Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> but wou'd it not make any Man mad, to have you put me upon finding readily our Dame's Houſe at all times, which I never ſaw but once in my Life? nay, and to find it at Midnight, when you your ſelf can't find it that have ſeen it a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times? Thou wilt make me deſperately an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, ſaid the Knight: Hark you, Heretick, have I not repeated it a thouſand times that I never ſaw the peerleſs <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> nor ever enter'd the Portals of her Palace; but that I am in Love with her purely by Hear-ſay, and upon the great Fame of her Beauty and rare Accompliſhments? I hear you ſay ſo now, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> and ſince you ſay you never ſaw her, I muſt needs tell you I never ſaw her neither. That's impoſſible, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> at leaſt you told me you ſaw her winnowing Wheat, when you brought me an Anſwer to the Letter which I ſent by you. That's neither here nor there Sir, reply'd <hi>Sancho;</hi> for to be plain with you, I ſaw her but by Hear-ſay too, and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer I brought you was by Hear-ſay as well as the reſt, and I know the Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi> no more than the Man in the Moon. <hi>Sancho, Sancho,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> there's a Time for all things; unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Mirth always turns to Sorrow. What, becauſe I declare that I have never ſeen nor ſpoken to the
<pb n="711" facs="tcp:54446:389"/>
Miſtreſs of my Soul, is it for you to trifle and ſay ſo too, when you're ſo ſenſible of the contrary?</p>
                        <p>Here their Diſcourſe was interrupted; a Fellow with two Mules happening to paſs by them, and by the Noiſe of the Plough which they drew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, they gueſs'd it might be ſome Country-La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer going out before Day to his Husbandry; and ſo indeed it was. He went ſinging the dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Ditty of the Defeat of the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Ronceſvalles; Ye</hi> Frenchmen <hi>all muſt rue the woeful Day.</hi> Let me die (ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> hearing what the Fellow ſung) if we have any good Succeſs to Night; doſt thou hear what this Peaſant ſings <hi>Sancho?</hi> Ay mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry do I, quoth the Squire; but what's the Rout at <hi>Ronceſvalles</hi> to us? it concerns us no more than if he had ſung the Ballad of <hi>Colly my Cow;</hi> we ſhall ſpeed neither the better nor worſe for't. By this Time the Plough-man being come up to them, Good Morrow honeſt Friend, cry'd Don <hi>Quixote</hi> to him; pray can you inform me which is the Palace of the peerleſs Princeſs the Lady <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo.</hi> Sir, ſaid the Fellow, I am a Stranger, and but lately come into this Town; I'm Plough-man to a rich Farmer: But here right over againſt you lives the Curate and the Sexton, they're the likelieſt to give you ſome Account of that Lady-Princeſs, as having a Liſt of all the Folks in Town, tho' I fancy there's no Princeſs at all lives here; there be indeed a Power of Gentle-folk, and each of them may be a Princeſs in her own Houſe for ought I know. Perhaps Friend, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> we ſhall find the Lady for whom I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire among thoſe. Why truly Maſter, anſwer'd the Plough-man, as you ſay, ſuch a thing may be, and ſo ſpeed you well! 'Tis Break of Day. With that ſwitching his Mules, he ſtay'd for no more Queſtions.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="712" facs="tcp:54446:390"/>
                           <hi>Sancho</hi> perceiving his Maſter in Suſpence, and not very well ſatisfy'd, Sir, ſaid he, the Day comes on apace, and I think 'twill not be very handſome for us to ſtay to be ſtar'd at, and ſit ſunning our ſelves in the Street. We had better ſlip out of Town again, and betake our ſelves to ſome Wood hard by, and then I will come back, and ſearch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Hole and Corner in Town for this ſame Houſe, Caſtle, or Palace of my Lady's, and 'twill go hard if I don't find it out at long run; then will I talk to her Highneſs, and tell her how you do, and how I left you hard by waiting her Orders and Inſtructions about talking with her in Private, without bringing her Name in queſtion. Dear <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid the Knight, thou haſt ſpoke, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a thouſand Sentences in the Compaſs of a few Words; I approve and lovingly accept thy Advice. Come, my Child, let us go, and in ſome neighbouring Grove find out a convenient Retreat; then, as thou ſay'ſt, thou ſhalt return to ſeek, to ſee, and to deliver my Embaſſy to my Lady, from whoſe Diſcretion and moſt courteous Mind I hope for a thouſand Favours, that may be counted more than wonderful. <hi>Sancho</hi> ſat upon Thorns till he had got his Maſter out of Town, leſt he ſhou'd diſcover the Falſhood of the Account he brought him in <hi>Sierra Morena</hi> of <hi>Dulcinea</hi>'s anſwering his Letter: So haſt'ning to be gone, they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently got two Miles from the Town into a Wood, where Don <hi>Quixote</hi> took Covert, and <hi>Sancho</hi> was diſpatch'd to <hi>Dulcinea.</hi> In which Negociation ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> How <hi>Sancho</hi> cunningly found out a Way to inchant the Lady <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> with other Paſſages no leſs certain than ridiculous.</head>
                        <p>THE Author of this important Hiſtory being come to the Matters which he relates in this Chapter, ſays he would willingly have left 'em buried in Oblivion, in a Manner deſpairing of his Reader's Belief: For Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Madneſs flies here to ſo extravagant a Pitch, that it may be ſaid to have out-ſtripp'd by two Bow-ſhots all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Credulity. However, notwithſtanding this Miſtruſt, he has ſet down every Particular, juſt as the ſame was tranſacted, without adding or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the leaſt Atom of Truth through the whole Hiſtory; not valuing in the leaſt ſuch Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections as may be rais'd to impeach him of Breach of Veracity. A Proceeding which ought to be commended; for Truth indeed rather alleviates than hurts, and will always bear up againſt Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, as Oil does above Water. And ſo continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Narration, he tells us, That when Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was retir'd into the Wood or Foreſt, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the Grove of Oaks near the Grand <hi>Toboſo,</hi> he order'd <hi>Sancho</hi> to go back to the City, and not to return to his Preſence till he had had Audience of his Lady, beſeeching her that it might pleaſe her to be ſeen by her Captive Knight, and vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to beſtow her Benediction on him, that by the
<pb n="714" facs="tcp:54446:391"/>
Virtue of that Bleſſing he might hope for a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous Event in all his Onſets and perillous At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts and Adventures. <hi>Sancho</hi> undertook the Charge, engaging him as ſucceſsful a Return of this as of his former Meſſage.</p>
                        <p>Go then, Child, ſaid the Knight, and have a Care of being daunted when thou approacheſt the Beams of that refulgent Sun of Beauty. Happy, thou, above all the Squires of the Univerſe! Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and engrave in thy Memory the Manner of thy Reception; mark whether her Colour changes upon the Delivery of thy Commiſſion; whether her Looks betray any Emotion or Concern when ſhe hears my Name; whether ſhe does not ſeem to ſit on her Cuſhion with a ſtrange Uneaſineſs, in caſe thou happen'ſt to find her ſeated on the pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous Throne of her Authority. And if ſhe be ſtanding, mind whether ſhe ſtands ſometimes upon one Leg, and ſometimes on another; whether ſhe repeats three or four times the Anſwer which ſhe gives thee, or changes it from kind to cruel, and then again from cruel to kind; whether ſhe does not ſeem to adjuſt her Hair, though every Lock appears in perfect Order. In ſhort, obſerve all her Actions, every Motion, every Geſture; for by the accurate Relation which thou giv'ſt of theſe things, I ſhall divine the Secrets of her Breaſt, and draw juſt Inferences in Relation to my Amour. For I muſt tell thee, <hi>Sancho,</hi> if thou do'ſt not know it already, that the outward Motions of Lovers are the ſureſt Indications of their inward Affections, they are the moſt faithful Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in an amorous Negociation. Go then, my truſty Squire, thy own better Stars, not mine, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend thee; and meet with a more proſperous E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, than that which in this doleful Deſart, toſs'd between Hopes and Fears, I dare expect. I'll go
<pb n="715" facs="tcp:54446:391"/>
Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> and I'll be back in a Trice: Mean while cheer up, I beſeech you; come, Sir, comfort that little Heart of yours, no bigger than a Hazle-Nut: Don't be caſt down I ſay; remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the old Saying, <hi>Faint Heart ne'er won fair Lady;</hi> Where there's no Hook, to be ſure there will hang no Bacon; The Hare leaps out of the Buſh where we leaſt look for her. I ſpeak this, to give you to underſtand, that tho' we could not find my Lady's Caſtle in the Night, I may light on it when I leaſt think on it now 'tis Day; and when I have found it, let me alone to deal with her. Well <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid the Knight, thou haſt a rare Talent in apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy Proverbs; Heaven give me better Succeſs in my Deſigns! This ſaid, <hi>Sancho</hi> turned his Back, and ſwitching his <hi>Dapple,</hi> left the Don on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, leaning on his Lance, and reſting on his Stirrups, full of melancholy and confus'd Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. Let us leave him too, to go along with <hi>Sancho,</hi> who was no leſs uneaſy in his Mind. No ſooner was he got out of the Grove, but turning about, and perceiving his Maſter quite out of Sight, he diſmounted, and laying himſelf down at the Foot of a Tree, thus began to hold a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley with himſelf. Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth he, pray let me ask you whither your Worſhip is a going? Is it to ſeek ſome Aſs you have loſt? No by my Troth. What is't then thou art hunting after? Why I am looking, you muſt know, for a thing of nothing, only a Princeſs, and in her the Sun of Beauty, forſooth, and all Heaven together. Well, and where do'ſt thou think to find all this, Friend of mine? Where! why in the great City of <hi>Tobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,</hi> And pray Sir, who ſet you to work? Who ſet me to work! There's a Queſtion! Why who but the moſt renowned Knight Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> he that rights the Wrong'd, that gives
<pb n="716" facs="tcp:54446:392"/>
Drink to the Hungry, and Meat to thoſe that are adry. Very good Sir; but pray do'ſt know where ſhe lives? Not I, efackins! but my Maſter ſays 'tis ſomewhere in a King's Palace or ſtately Caſtle. And haſt thou ever ſeen her trow? No marry han't I: Why my Maſter himſelf ne'er ſat Eyes on her in his Life. But tell me, <hi>Sancho,</hi> what if the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Toboſo</hi> ſhou'd know that you are come to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veagle their Princeſſes, and make their Ladies run aſtray, and ſhould baſte your Carcaſs handſomely, and leave you ne'er a ſound Rib, do you not think they would be mightily in the Right on't? Why, troth, they would not be much in the Wrong; tho' methinks they ſhould conſider too that I am but a Servant, and ſent on another Body's Errand, and ſo I am not at all in Fault. Nay, never truſt to that, <hi>Sancho,</hi> for your People of <hi>La Mancha</hi> are plaguy hot and toucheous, and will endure no Tricks to be put upon 'em: Body of me! if they but ſmoak thee, they'll mawl thee after a ſtrange Rate. No, no, fore-warn'd fore-arm'd: Why do I go about to look for more Feet than a Cat has, for another Man's Maggot! Beſides, when all's done, I may perhaps as well look for a Needle in a Bottle of Hay, or for a Scholar at <hi>Salamanca,</hi> as for <hi>Dulci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea</hi> all over the Town of <hi>Toboſo.</hi> Well 'tis the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and nothing but the Devil, has put me upon this troubleſome Piece of Work. This was the Dialogue <hi>Sancho</hi> had with himſelf; and the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it was the following Soliloquy. Well, there's a Remedy for all things but Death, which will be ſure to lay us flat one Time or other. This Maſter of mine, by a thouſand Tokens I ha' ſeen, is a downright Madman, and I think I come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in an Inch of him; nay, I am the greater Cods<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of the two, to ſerve and follow him as I do, if the Proverb ben't a Liar, Shew me thy Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="717" facs="tcp:54446:392"/>
I'll tell thee what thou art; and t'other old Saw, Birds of a Feather flock together. Now then my Maſter, being mad, and ſo very mad as to miſtake ſometimes one thing for another, Black for White, and White for Black, as when he took the Wind-mills for Giants, the Friar's Mules for Dromedaries, and the Flocks of Sheep for Armies, and much more to the ſame Tune, I gueſs 't will be no hard Matter to paſs upon him the firſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-Wench I ſhall meet with, for the Lady <hi>Dulcinea.</hi> If he won't believe, I'll ſwear it; if he ſwear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, I'll out-ſwear him; and if he be poſitive, I'll be more poſitive than he; and ſtand to't, and out-face him in't, come what will on't: So that when he finds I won't flinch, he'll either reſolve never to ſend me more of his ſleeveleſs Errands, ſeeing what a lame Account I bring him, or he'll think ſome one of thoſe wicked Wizards, who, he ſays, owes him a Grudge, has tranſmogrify'd her into ſome other Shape out of Spight. This happy Contrivance help'd to compoſe <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Mind, and now he look'd on his grand Affair to be as good as done. Having therefore ſtay'd till the Evening, that his Maſter might not think he had employ'd ſo much Time in Going and Coming, things fell out very luckily for him; for as he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe to mount his <hi>Dapple,</hi> he ſpy'd three Country-Wenches coming towards him from <hi>Toboſo,</hi> upon three young Aſſes, whether Male or Female the Author has left undetermin'd, tho' we may reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably ſuppoſe they were She-Aſſes, ſuch being moſt frequently us'd to ride on by Country-Laſſes in thoſe Parts. But this being no very material Circumſtance, we need not dwell any longer upon the Deciſion of that Point: 'Tis ſufficient they were Aſſes, and diſcover'd by <hi>Sancho;</hi> who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon made all the Haſte he cou'd to get to his
<pb n="718" facs="tcp:54446:393"/>
Maſter, and found him breathing out a thouſand. Sighs and amorous Lamentations. Well my <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> ſaid the Knight immediately upon his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, what News? are we to mark this Day with a white or a black Stone? E'en mark it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Red-Oker, anſwer'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> as they do Church-Chairs, that every Body may know who they belong to. Why then, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> I ſuppoſe thou bring'ſt good News. Ay marry do I, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> you have no more to do but to clap Spurs to <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and get into the open Fields, and you'll ſee my Lady <hi>Dulcinae del Toboſo,</hi> with a Brace of her Damſels, coming to ſee your Worſhip. Bleſſed Heaven! cry'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> what art thou ſaying, my dear <hi>Sancho?</hi> Take Heed, and do not preſume to beguile my real Grief with a deluſive Joy. Adſookers! Sir, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> what ſhou'd I get by putting a Trick upon you, and being found out the next Moment? Seeing is Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving all the World over. Come Sir, put on, put on, and you'll ſee our Lady Princeſs coming, dreſs'd up and bedeck'd like her own ſweet ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. Her Damſels and ſhe are all one Spark of Gold, all Pearls, all Diamonds, all Rubies, all Cloth of Gold above ten Inches high. Their Hair ſpread over their Shoulders like ſo many Sun-Beams, and dangling and dancing in the Wind; and what's more, they ride upon three Flea-bitten gambling Hags; there's not a Piece of Horſe-fleſh can match 'em in three Kingdoms. Ambling Nags thou meaneſt <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quixote.</hi> Gambling Hags or ambling Nags, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> there's no ſuch Difference methinks; but be they what they will, I'm ſure I ne'er ſat Eyes on finer Creatures than thoſe that ride upon their Backs, eſpecially my Lady <hi>Dulcinea;</hi> 'twould make one ſwoon away but to look upon her. Let us move then, my
<pb n="719" facs="tcp:54446:393"/>
                           <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and as a Gratification for theſe unexpected happy Tidings, I freely beſtow on thee the beſt Spoils the next Adventure we meet with ſhall afford; and if that content thee not, take the Colts which my three Mares thou know'ſt of, are now ready to Foal on our Town-Common. Thank you for the Colts, ſaid <hi>Sancho;</hi> but as for the Spoils, I am not ſure they'll be worth any thing. They were now got out of the Wood, and diſcover'd the three Country-Laſſes at a ſmall diſtance. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> caſting his Eyes towards <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſo,</hi> and ſeeing no Body on the Road but the three Wenches, was ſtrangely troubl'd in Mind, and turning to <hi>Sancho,</hi> ask'd him whether the Princeſs and her Damſels were come out of the City when he left 'em? Out of the City, cry'd <hi>Sancho!</hi> Why where are your Eyes? Are they in your Heels, in the name of Wonder, that you can't ſee 'em coming towards us, ſhining as bright as the Sun at Noon-day? I ſee nothing, return'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> but three Wenches upon as many Aſſes. Now Heaven deliver me from the Devil, quoth <hi>Sancho!</hi> Is't poſſible your Worſhip ſhou'd miſtake three what-d'ye-call-ems, three Ambling Nags. I mean, as white as driven Snow, for three ragged Aſs-Colts. Body of me! I'll e'en peell off my Beard by the Roots an't be ſo. Take it from me, Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid the Knight, they are either He, or She-Aſſes, as ſure as I am Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and thou <hi>Sancho Pança;</hi> at leaſt, they appear to be ſuch. Come, Sir, quoth the Squire, don't talk at that rate, but ſnuff your Eyes, and go pay your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to the Miſtreſs of your Soul; for ſhe's near at Hand; and ſo ſaying, <hi>Sancho</hi> haſtens up to the three Country-Wenches, and alighting from <hi>Dapple,</hi> took hold of one of the Aſſes by the Halter, and falling on his Knees, Queen, and Princeſs, and
<pb n="720" facs="tcp:54446:394"/>
Dutcheſs of Beauty, quoth he, an't pleaſe your Haughtineſs, and Greatneſs, vouchſafe to take into your good Grace and liking, yonder Knight, your Priſoner and Captive, who's turn'd of a ſudden into cold Marble-Stone, and ſtruck all of a heap, to ſee himſelf before your High and Mightineſs. I am <hi>Sancho Pança,</hi> his Squire, and he himſelf the wand'ring Weather-beaten Knight, Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> otherwiſe call'd the Knight of the Woeful Figure. By this time, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> having plac'd himſelf down on his Knees by <hi>Sancho,</hi> gaz'd with dubious and diſconſolate Eyes on the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whom <hi>Sancho</hi> call'd Queen and Lady; and perceiving her to be no more than a plain Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-Wench, ſo far from being well-favour'd, that ſhe was blubber-cheek'd, and flat-nos'd, he was loſt in Aſtoniſhment, and cou'd not utter one Word. On the other ſide, the Wenches were no leſs ſurpriz'd, to ſee themſelves ſtopp'd by two Men in ſuch different out-ſides, and on their Knees. But at laſt, ſhe whoſe Aſs was held by <hi>Sancho,</hi> took Courage, and broke Silence in an angry Tone. Come, cry'd ſhe, get out of our way with a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain, and let us go about our Buſineſs; for we are in haſte. Oh Princeſs! and Univerſal Lady of <hi>Toboſo,</hi> anſwer'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> why does not that great Heart of yours melt, to ſee the Poſt and Pillar of Knight-Errantry fall down before your high and mighty Preſence! Hoy day (quoth another of the Females, hearing this) What's here to do! Look how your ſmall Gentry come to jeer and flout poor Country-Girls, as if we could not give 'em as good as they bring. Go, get about your Buſineſs, and let us go about ours, and ſpeed you well. Riſe, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> hearing this, for I am now convinc'd, that my malicious Stars, not yet ſatisfy'd with my paſs'd Misfortunes, ſtill
<pb n="721" facs="tcp:54446:394"/>
ſhed their baleful Influence, and have barr'd all the Paſſages that cou'd convey Relief to my miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Soul, in this frail Habitation of Animated Clay. Oh! thou Extremity of all that's valuable, Maſter-piece of all humane Perfection, and only Comfort of this afflicted Heart, thy Adorer; tho' now a ſpightful Inchanter perſecutes me, ad faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinates my Sight, hiding with Miſts and Cataracts from me, and me alone, thoſe Peerleſs Beauties, under the foul diſguiſe of rural Deformity, if he has not transform'd thy faithful Knight into ſome ugly Shape to make me loathſome to thy Eyes, look on me with a ſmiling Amorous Eye; and in the Submiſſion and Genuflection which I pay to thy Beauty, even under the fatal Cloud that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcures it, read the Humility with which my Soul adores thee. Tittle-tattle, quoth the Country-Wench. Spare your Breath to cool your Porridge, and rid me of your idle Gibberiſh. Get you on, Sir, and let us go; and we ſhall think it a Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. This ſaid, <hi>Sancho</hi> made way for her, and let her paſs, over-joy'd his Plot had ſucceeded ſo well. The Imaginary <hi>Dulcinea</hi> was no ſooner at Liberty, but Punching her Aſs with the end of a Staff which ſhe had in her Hand, ſhe began to ſcour along the Plain: But the angry Beaſt not being us'd to ſuch ſmart Inſtigations, fell a Kick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Wincing at ſuch a rate, that down came my Lady <hi>Dulcinea.</hi> Preſently Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ran to help her up, and <hi>Sancho</hi> to re-ſettle and gird her Pack-Saddle, that hung under the Aſs's Belly. Which being done, the Knight very courteouſly was going to take his Inchanted Miſtreſs in his Arms, to ſet her on her Saddle; but ſhe being now got on her Legs, took a run, and clapping her Hands upon the Aſs's Crupper, at one Jump leap'd into her Pannel, as ſwift as a Hawk, and
<pb n="722" facs="tcp:54446:395"/>
there ſhe ſate with her Legs aſtride, like a Man. By St. <hi>Roque!</hi> quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> our Lady Miſtreſs is as nimble as an Eel. Let me be Hang'd, if I don't think ſhe might teach the beſt Jockey in <hi>Cordova</hi> or <hi>Mexico</hi> to get a Horſe-back. At one Jump ſhe was vaulted into the Saddle, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Spurs makes her Nag ſmoke it away, like a Gray-hound; her Damſels are notable Whipſters too; adad! they don't come much ſhort of her, for they fly like the Wind. Indeed, he ſaid true, for when <hi>Dulcinea</hi> was once Mounted, they all made after her full ſpeed, without ſo much as looking behind 'em, for above half a League. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> follow'd 'em as far as he cou'd with his Eyes; and when they were quite out of ſight, turning to his Squire, now <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid he, What think'ſt thou of this matter? Are not theſe baſe Inchanters. Inexorable! How extenſive is their Spight, thus to deprive me of the Happineſs of ſeeing the Object of my Wiſhes in her natural Shape and Glory. Sure I was doom'd to be an Example of Misfortunes, and the Mark againſt which thoſe Caitiffs are employ'd to ſhoot all the Arrows of their Hatred. Note, <hi>Sancho,</hi> that theſe Traytors were not content to turn and Transform my <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinea,</hi> but they muſt do it into the vile and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd Reſemblance of that Country-Wench; nay, they even took from her that ſweet Scent of Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant Flowers and Amber, thoſe grateful Odours, ſo eſſential to Ladies of her Rank; for, to tell the Truth, when I went to help her upon her Nag, as thou call'ſt it, (for to me it ſeem'd nothing but an Aſs) ſuch a Whiff, ſuch a rank Hogo of hot Garlick Invaded my Noſtrils, as had like to have overcome me, and put me into a Convulſion. Oh ye vile Wretches, cry'd <hi>Sancho!</hi> Oh ye wicked, and ill-minded Enchanters! Oh that I might but once ſee the whole Neſt of ye threaded
<pb n="723" facs="tcp:54446:395"/>
together on one String, and hung up a ſmoaking by the Gills like ſo many Pilchers! You know a deal, you can do a deal, and you make a deal of Mischief. One would have thought you might have been contented, like a pack of Rogues as you are, with having chang'd the Pearls of my Lady's Eyes into Acorns, and her moſt pure Golden Locks into a Red Cow's Tail; but you muſt be medling with her Breath, by which we might have gueſs'd what lay hid under that courſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe; tho' for my part I muſt needs own, ſhe did not appear to me Deform'd at all; but rather Fair and Beautiful; by the ſame Token that ſhe had a Mole on the right ſide of her Upper Lip, like a Whisker, whence ſprouted ſeven or eight red Hairs, each about a Span in length, looking like ſo many ſtrings of Gold-wire. As the Moles on the Body, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> are generally an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to thoſe on the Face, <hi>Dulcinea</hi> ſhould have ſuch another Mole on that Thigh, which is oppoſite to that ſide of her Face where that Beauty-ſpot is ſeated; but methinks, <hi>Sancho,</hi> the Hairs thou talk'ſt of are of a length ſomewhat extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary for Moles. That's neither here nor there, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> there they were I'll aſſure you, and they look'd too as if ſhe had brought 'em with her into the World. That I believe, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> for every part of <hi>Dulcinea</hi> muſt be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally perfect and compleat; ſo that though a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Moles were ſcatter'd over her fair outſide, and as conſpicuous too as that which thou didſt ſee, they would be no Deformities in her; but ſo many Moons and Stars, an additional Luſtre to her Beauty. But tell me, <hi>Sancho,</hi> that Saddle which appear'd to me to be the Pannel of an Aſs, was it a Pillion or a Side-Saddle? It was a Side-Saddle, anſwer'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> with a Field-covering, and ſo
<pb n="724" facs="tcp:54446:396"/>
rich that it might purchaſe half a Kingdom. And could not I ſee all this, cry'd Don <hi>Quixote.</hi> Well, I have ſaid it, and muſt repeat it a thouſand times, I am the moſt unfortunate Man in the Univerſe. The cunning Rogue of a Squire, hearing his Maſter talk at that rate, could hardly keep his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and refrain from Laughing to ſee how ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably he had fool'd him. At laſt, after a great deal of Diſcourſe of the ſame Nature, they both Mounted again, and took the Road for <hi>Saragoſſa,</hi> deſigning to be preſent at the moſt celebrated Feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivals and Sports that are Solemnized every Year in that Noble City. But they met with many Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents by the Way, and thoſe ſo extraordinary, and worthy the Reader's Information, that they muſt not be paſs'd over unrecorded nor unread; as ſhall appear from what follows.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of the Stupendous Adventure that befell the Valorous Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> with the Chariot or Cart of <hi>the Court or Parliament of Death.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>DON <hi>Quixote</hi> rode on very melancholick; the Malice of the Magicians in transforming his Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi> perplex'd him ſtrangely, and ſet his Thoughts upon the Rack, how to diſſolve the Inchantment, and reſtore her to her former Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. In this diſconſolate Condition, he went on abandon'd to Diſtraction, careleſly giving <hi>Rozinante</hi>
                           <pb n="725" facs="tcp:54446:396"/>
the Reins: And the Horſe finding himſelf at liberty, and tempted by the goodneſs of the Graſs, took the opportunity to feed very heartily. Which <hi>Sancho</hi> perceiving, Sir, (ſaid he, rouzing him from his waking Dream) Sorrow was never deſign'd for Beaſts, but Men; but yet let me tell you, if Men give way to't too much, they make Beaſts of themſelves. Come, Sir, awake, awake by any means, pull up the Reins and ride like a Man; cheer up, and ſhew your ſelf a Knight-Errant. What the Devil ails you; Was ever a Man ſo Mop'd? Are we here or are we in <hi>France,</hi> as the Saying is? Let all the <hi>Dulcinea</hi>'s in the World, be doom'd to the Pit of Hell, rather than one ſingle Knight-Errant be caſt down at this rate. Hold, <hi>Sancho,</hi> cry'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> with more Spirit than one would have expected; hold, I ſay; not a Blaſphemous Word againſt that Beauteous Inchanted Lady; for all her Misfortunes are chargeable on the unhappy Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and flow from the Envy which thoſe Necromancers bear to me. So ſay I, Sir, reply'd the Squire, for would it not vex any one that had ſeen her before, to ſee her now as you ſaw her! Ay, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid the Knight, thy Eyes were bleſs'd with a View of her Perfections in their entire Luſtre, thou haſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſay ſo. Againſt me, againſt my Eyes only is the Malice of her Transformation directed. But now I think on't <hi>Sancho,</hi> thy Deſcription of her Beauty was a little abſurd in that particular of comparing her Eyes to Pearls; ſure ſuch Eyes are more like thoſe of a Whiting or a Sea-Bream, than thoſe of a fair Lady; and in my Opinion <hi>Dulcinea</hi>'s Eyes are rather like two verdant Emeralds rail'd in with two Celeſtial Arches, which ſignify her Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brows. Therefore, <hi>Sancho,</hi> you muſt take your Pearls from her Eyes, and apply 'em to her Teeth,
<pb n="726" facs="tcp:54446:397"/>
for I verily believe you miſtook the one for the other. Troth! Sir, it might be ſo, reply'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> for her Beauty confounded me, as much as her Uglineſs did you. But let us leave all to Heaven, that knows all things that befall us in this Vale of Miſery, this wicked troubleſome World, where we can be ſure of nothing without ſome Spice of Knavery or Roguery. In the mean time, there's a thing come into my Head that puzzles me plaguily. Pray Sir, when you get the better of any Giant or Knight, and ſend 'em to pay Homage to the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of your Lady and Miſtreſs, how the Devil will the poor Knight or Giant be able to find this ſame <hi>Dulcinea.</hi> I can't but think how they'll be to ſeek, how they'll ſaunter about, gaping and ſtaring all over <hi>Toboſo</hi> Town, and if they ſhould meet her full butt in the middle of the King's High-way, yet they'll know her no more than they knew the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that begot me. Perhaps, <hi>Sancho,</hi> anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> the Force of her Inchantment does not extend ſo far as to debar Vanquiſh'd Knights and Giants from the Privilege of ſeeing her in her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouded Beauties: I will try the Experiment on the firſt I conquer, and will command them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn immediately to me, to inform me of their Succeſs. I like what you ſay main well, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> we may chance to find out the Truth by this means; and if ſo be my Lady is only hid from your Worſhip, ſhe has not ſo much reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain as you may have; but when all comes to all, ſo our Miſtreſs be ſafe and ſound, let us make the beſt of a bad Market, and e'en go ſeek Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The reſt we'll leave to Time, which is the beſt Doctor in ſuch Caſes, nay, in worſe Diſeaſes. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was going to return an Anſwer, but was interrupted by a Cart that was croſſing the Road. He that drove it was a hideous Devil, and
<pb n="727" facs="tcp:54446:397"/>
the Cart being open, without either Tilt or Boughs, expos'd a Parcel of the moſt ſurprizing and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Shapes imaginable. The firſt Figure that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was no leſs than Death it ſelf, though with a Humane Countenance; on the one ſide of Death ſtood an Angel with large Wings of different Colours; on the other ſide was plac'd an Emperor with a Crown that ſeem'd to be of Gold, at the Feet of Death lay <hi>Cupid</hi> with his Bow, Quiver and Arrows, but not blind-fold. Next to theſe a Knight appear'd compleatly Arm'd, except his Head, on which inſtead of a Helmet he, wore a Hat; whereon was mounted a large Plume of Party-colour'd Feathers. There were alſo ſeveral other Perſons in ſtrange and various Dreſſes. This ſtrange Appearance at firſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſurpriz'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and frighted the poor Squire out of his Wits; but preſently the Knight clear'd up on ſecond Thoughts, imagining it ſome rare and hazardous Adventure that call'd on his Courage. Pleas'd with this Conceit, and arm'd with a Reſolution able to affront any Danger, he plac'd himſelf in the middle of the Road, and with a loud and menacing Voice, You Carter, Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or Devil, cry'd he, or whatever you be, let me know immediately whence you come, and whither you go, and what ſtrange Figures are thoſe which load that Carriage, which by the Fraight rather ſeems to be <hi>Charon</hi>'s Boat, than any terreſtrial Vehicle. Sir, anſwer'd the Devil very civilly, ſtopping his Cart; we are ſtrolling Players, that belong to <hi>Angulo</hi>'s Company, and it being <hi>Corpus-Chriſti-tide</hi> we have this Morning Acted a Tragedy call'd the Parliament of Death, in a Town yonder behind the Mountain, and this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon we are to Play it again in the Town you ſee before us, which being ſo near, we travel to it
<pb n="728" facs="tcp:54446:398"/>
in the ſame Cloaths we Act in, to ſave the trouble of new Dreſſing our ſelves. That young Man plays Death, that other an Angel: This Woman, Sir, our Poet's Bed-fellow, plays the Queen; there is one acts a Soldier, he next to him an Emperour; and I my ſelf play the Devil, and you muſt know, the Devil is the beſt Part in the Play. If you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be ſatisfy'd in any thing elſe, do but ask and I'll reſolve you, for the Devil knows every thing. Now by the Faith of my Function, ſaid Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote,</hi> I find we ought not to give Credit to Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, before we have made the Experiment of feeling them; for at the Diſcovery of ſuch a Scene, I would have ſworn ſome ſtrange Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had been approaching. I wiſh you well, good People; drive on to Act your Play, and if I can be ſerviceable to you in any Particular, believe me ready to aſſiſt you with all my Heart; for in my very Childhood I lov'd Shows, and have been a great Admirer of Dramatick Repreſentations from any Youthful Days. During this Friendly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, it unluckily fell out, that one of the Company antickly dreſs'd, being the Fool of the Play, came up frisking with his Morrice-Bells, and three full-blown Cow's-Bladders faſten'd to the end of a Stick. In this odd Appearance he began to flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh his Stick in the Air, and bounce his Bladders againſt the Ground juſt at <hi>Rozinante</hi>'s Noſe. The Jingling of the Bells, and the rattling Noiſe of the Bladders ſo ſtartl'd and affrighted the quiet Creature, that Don <hi>Quixote</hi> cou'd not hold him in; and having got the Curb betwixt his Teeth, away the Horſe hurried his unwilling Rider up and down the Plain, with much more Swiftneſs than his feeble Bones ſeemed to promiſe. <hi>Sancho</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the Danger of his Maſter's being thrown, preſently alighted, and ran as faſt as he cou'd to
<pb n="729" facs="tcp:54446:398"/>
his Aſſiſtance; but before he cou'd come up to him, <hi>Rozinante</hi> had made a falſe Step, and laid his Maſter and himſelf on the Ground; which was indeed the common end of <hi>Rozinante</hi>'s mad Tricks and preſumptuous Racing. On the other ſide, the Fool no ſooner ſaw <hi>Sancho</hi> ſlide off to help his Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but he leap'd upon poor <hi>Dapple,</hi> and rattling his Bladders over the terrify'd Animal's Hide, made him fly thro' the Field towards the Town where they were to play. <hi>Sancho</hi> beheld his Maſter's Fall, and his Aſs's Flight at the ſame time, and ſtood ſtrangely divided in himſelf, not knowing which to aſſiſt firſt, his Maſter or his Beaſt. At length, the Duty of a good Servant and a faithful Squire prevailing, he ran to his Maſter, tho' every obſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous Bounce with the Bladders upon <hi>Dapple</hi>'s Hind-quarters, ſtruck him to the very Soul, and he would have wiſh'd every Blow upon his own Eye-Balls, rather than on the leaſt Hair of his Aſs's Tail. In this Agony of Spirit, he came to Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> whom he found in far worſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances than the poor Knight cou'd have wiſh'd, and helping him to remount, Oh! Sir, cry'd he, the Devil is run away with <hi>Dapple.</hi> What Devil, ask'd Don <hi>Quixote?</hi> The Devil with the Bladders, anſwer'd <hi>Sancho.</hi> No matter, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote.</hi> I'll force the Traytor to reſtore him, tho' he were to lock him up in the moſt profound and gloomy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns of Hell. Follow me, <hi>Sancho,</hi> We may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overtake the Waggon, and the Mules ſhall attone for the Loſs of the Aſs. You need not be in ſuch haſte now, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> for I perceive the Devil has left <hi>Dapple</hi> already, and is gone his ways. What <hi>Sancho</hi> ſaid was true, for both Aſs and Devil tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bl'd for Company, in imitation of Don <hi>Quixote</hi> and <hi>Rozinante;</hi> and <hi>Dapple</hi> having left his new Rider to walk on Foot to the Town, now came himſelf
<pb n="730" facs="tcp:54446:399"/>
running back to his Maſter. All this, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> ſhall not hinder me from revenging the Affront put upon us by that unmannerly Devil, at the Expence of ſome of his Companions, tho' it were the Emperor himſelf. Oh good your Worſhip! cry'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> never mind it; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you take my Counſel, Sir; never med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with Players, there's never any thing to be got by't; they are a ſort of People that always find a many Friends. I have known one of 'em taken up for two Murders, yet 'ſcape the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. You muſt know, that as they are a Parcel of merry Wags, and make Sport wherever they come, every Body is fond of 'em, and is ready to ſtand their Friend, eſpecially if they be the King's Players, or ſome of the noted Gangs, who go at ſuch a taring Rate, that one might miſtake ſome of 'em for Gentlemen or Lords. I care not, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> though all Mankind united to aſſiſt 'em, that buffooning Devil ſhall never 'ſcape unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, to ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whereupon riding up to the Waggon, which was now got pretty near the Town, Hold, hold, he cry'd, ſtay my merry Sparks, I'll teach you to be civil to the Beaſts that are intruſted with the honourable Burden of a Squire to a Knight-Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. This loud Salutation having reach'd the Ears of the ſtrolling Company, tho' at a good Diſtance, they preſently underſtood what it imported; and reſolving to be ready to entertain him, Death pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently leap'd out of the Cart; the Emperor, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil-driver, and the Angel immediately follow'd; and even the Queen, and the God <hi>Cupid,</hi> as well as the reſt, having taken up their ſhare of Flints, ſtood rang'd in Battle-Array ready to receive their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as ſoon as he ſhould come within Stone-ſhot.

Order, with their Arms lifted up, and ready to let fly at him a furious Volley of Shot, made a Halt, to conſider in what Quarter he might attack this Dreadful Battalion, with leaſt Danger to his Perſon. Thus pauſing, <hi>Sancho</hi> overtook him, and ſeeing him ready to charge, For Goodneſs ſake, Sir, cry'd he what d'ye mean! Are you mad, Sir? There's no Fence againſt the Beggar's Bullets, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you cou'd fight with a Brazen Bell over you. Is it not rather Raſhneſs than true Courage, think you, for one Man to offer to ſet upon a whole Army? Where Death is too, and where Emperors fight in Perſon; nay, and where good and bad Angels are againſt you? But if all this weighs nothing with you, conſider, I beſeech you, that though they ſeem to be Kings, Princes and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, yet there's not ſo much one Knight-Errant among 'em all. Now thou haſt hit upon the only Point, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> that could ſtop the Fury of my Arm: For indeed, as I have often told thee, <hi>Sancho,</hi> I am bound up from drawing my Sword againſt any below the Order of Knighthood. 'Tis thy Buſineſs to fight in this Cauſe, if thou haſt a juſt Reſentment of the Indignities offer'd to thy Aſs; and I from this Poſt will encourage and aſſiſt thee with ſalutary. Orders and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. No, I thank you, Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I hate Revenge; a true Chriſtian muſt forgive and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get; and as for <hi>Dapple,</hi> I don't doubt but to find him willing to leave the Matter to me, and ſtand to my Verdict in the Caſe, which is to live peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and quietly as long as Heaven is pleas'd to let me. Nay then, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> if that be thy Reſolution, Good <hi>Sancho,</hi> Prudent <hi>Sancho,</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Sancho,</hi> downright <hi>Sancho,</hi> let us leave theſe idle Apparitions, and proceed in ſearch of more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial and honourable Adventures, of which, in
<pb n="732" facs="tcp:54446:401"/>
all Probability, this part of the World will afford us a wonderful Variety. So ſaying, he wheel'd off, and <hi>Sancho</hi> follow'd him. On the other ſide, Death with all his flying Squadron, return'd to their Cart, and went on their Journey. Thus end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the moſt dreadful Adventure of the Chariot of Death, much more happily than could have been expected, thanks to the laudable Counſels which <hi>Sancho Pança</hi> gave his Maſter; who the Day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing had another Adventure no leſs remarkable, with one that was a Knight-Errant and a Lover too.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> The Valorous Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Strange Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture with the Knight of the Mirrors.</head>
                        <p>DON <hi>Quixote</hi> paſs'd the Night, that ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Encounter with Death, under the Covert of ſome lofty Trees; where, at <hi>Sancho</hi>'s perſuaſion, he refreſh'd himſelf with ſome of the Proviſions which <hi>Dapple</hi> carried. As they were at Supper, Well, Sir, quoth the Squire, what a rare Fool I had been, had I choſen for my good News the Spoils of your firſt Venture, inſtead of the Breed of the three Mares! Troth! commend me to the ſaying, <hi>A Bird in Hand is worth two in the Buſb.</hi> However, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> had'ſt thou let me fall on, as I wou'd have done, thou might'ſt have ſhar'd at leaſt the Emperor's Golden Crown, and <hi>Cupid</hi>'s Painted Wings; for I wou'd have pluck'd 'em off, and put 'em into thy power. Ay,
<pb n="733" facs="tcp:54446:401"/>
but, ſays <hi>Sancho,</hi> your Strolling Emperor's Crowns and Scepters are not of pure Gold, but Tinſel and Copper. I grant it, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> nor is it fit the Decorations of the Stage ſhould be real, but rather Imitations, and the reſemblance of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alities, as the Plays themſelves muſt be; which, by the way, I wou'd have you love and eſteem, <hi>Sancho,</hi> and conſequently thoſe that write, and alſo thoſe that act 'em; for they are all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to the good of the Common-wealth, and ſet before our Eyes thoſe Looking-glaſſes that reflect a lively Repreſentation of Humane Life; nothing being able to give us a more juſt Idea of Nature, and what we are or ought to be, than Comedians and Comedies. Prithee tell me, haſt thou never ſeen a Play acted, where Kings, Emperors, Prelates, Knights, Ladies, and other Characters are introduc'd on the Stage? One acts a Ruffian, another a Soldier; this Man a Cheat, and that a Merchant; one plays a deſigning Fool, and another a Fooliſh Lover: But the Play done, and the Actors undreſs'd, they are all equal, and as they were before. All this I have ſeen, quoth <hi>Sancho.</hi> Juſt ſuch Comedy, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> is acted on the great Stage of the World, where ſome play the Emperors, others the Prelates, and, in ſhort, all the Parts that can be brought into a Dramatick Piece; till Death, which is the Cataſtrophe and End of the Action, ſtrips the Actors of all their Marks of Diſtinction, and levels their quality in the Grave. A rare Compariſon, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> tho' not ſo new, but that I have heard it over and over. Juſt ſuch another is that of a Game at Cheſs, where while the Play laſts every Piece has it particular Office; but when the Game's over, they are all mingl'd and huddl'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and clapp'd into a Bag, juſt as when Life's
<pb n="734" facs="tcp:54446:402"/>
ended we are laid up in the Grave. Truly, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> thy Simplicity leſſens, and thy Senſe improves every day. And good reaſon why, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> ſome of your Worſhip's Wit muſt needs ſtick to me; for your dry unkindly Land, with good dunging and tilling, will in time yield a good Crop. I mean, Sir, that the Dung and Muck of your Converſation being thrown on the barren ground of my Wit, together with the Time I ha' ſerv'd your Worſhip, and kept you Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; which is, as a body may ſay, the Tillage; I muſt needs bring forth bleſſed Fruit at laſt, ſo as not to ſhame my Maſter, but keep in the Paths of good Manners, which you have beaten in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my ſodden Underſtanding. <hi>Sancho</hi>'s affected Style made Don <hi>Quixote</hi> laugh, tho' he thought his words true in the main; and he could not but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire at his Improvement. But the Fellow never diſcover'd his weakneſs ſo much as by endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hide it, being moſt apt to tumble when he ſtrove to ſoar too high. His excellence lay chiefly in a knack at drawing Proverbs into his Diſcourſe, whether to the purpoſe or not, as any one that has obſerv'd his manner of ſpeaking in this Hiſtory, muſt have perceiv'd.</p>
                        <p>In ſuch Diſcourſes they paſſed a great part of the Night, till <hi>Sancho</hi> wanted to drop the Portcullices of his Eyes, which was his way of ſaying he had a mind to go to ſleep: Thereupon he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harneſs'd <hi>Dapple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> and ſet him a grazing: But poor <hi>Rozinante</hi> was condemn'd to ſtand Saddl'd all Night, by his Maſter's Injunction and Preſcription, us'd of old by all Knight-Errants, who never unſaddl'd their Steeds in the Field, but took off their Bridles, and hung 'em at the Pummel of the Saddle. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he was not forſaken by faithful <hi>Dapple,</hi> whoſe Friendſhip was ſo unparallell'd and inviolable, that
<pb n="735" facs="tcp:54446:402"/>
unqueſtion'd Tradition has handed it down from Father to Son, that the Author of this true Hiſtory compos'd particular Chapters of the united Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of theſe two Beaſts; tho', to preſerve the Decorum due to ſo heroick a Hiſtory, he wou'd not inſert 'em in the Work. Yet ſometimes he cannot forbear giving us ſome few Touches on that Subject; as when he writes, That the two friendly Creatures took a mighty Pleaſure in being together to ſcrub and lick one another; and when they had had enough of that ſport, <hi>Rozinante</hi> would gently lean his Head at leaſt half a yard over <hi>Dapple</hi>'s Neck, and ſo they wou'd ſtand very lovingly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, looking wiſtly on the ground for two or three Days; except ſome body made 'em leave that Contemplative Poſture, or Hunger compell'd them to a Separation. Nay, I cannot paſs by what is reported of the Author, how he left in writing, That he had compar'd their Friendſhip to that of <hi>Nyſus</hi> and <hi>Euryalus,</hi> and that of <hi>Pylades</hi> and <hi>Oreſtes,</hi> which if it were ſo, deſerves univerſal Admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the ſincere affection of theſe quiet Animals being a juſt Reflection on Men, who are ſo guilty of breaking their Friendſhip to one another. From hence came the ſaying, <hi>There's no Friend; all Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's gone: Now Men hug, then fight anon.</hi> And that other, <hi>Where you ſee your Friend, truſt to your ſelf.</hi> Neither ſhou'd the World take it ill, that the cordial affection of theſe Animals was compar'd by our Author to that of Men; ſince many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Principles of Prudence and Morality have been learn'd from irrational Creatures; as, The uſe of Clyſters from the Stork, and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Vomiting from the Dog. The Crane gave Mankind an Example of Vigilance, the Ant of Providence, the Elephant of Honeſty, and the Horſe of Loyalty. At laſt <hi>Sancho</hi> fell aſleep at
<pb n="736" facs="tcp:54446:403"/>
the Root of a Cork-Tree, and his Maſter fetch'd a ſlumber under a ſpacious Oak. But it was not long e'er he was diſturb'd by a Noiſe behind him, and ſtarting up, he look'd and hearken'd on the ſide whence he thought the Voice came, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd two Men on Horſe-back; one of whom let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf careleſly ſlide down from the Saddle, and calling to the other, Alight Friend, ſaid he, and unbridle the Horſe; for methinks this place will ſupply them plentifully with Paſture, and me with Silence and Solitude to indulge my amorous Thoughts. While he ſaid this, he laid himſelf down on the Graſs; in doing which the Armour he had on made a Noiſe, a ſure ſign, that gave Don <hi>Quixote</hi> to underſtand he was ſome Knight-Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. Thereupon going to <hi>Sancho,</hi> who ſlept on, he pluck'd him by the Arm, and having wak'd him with much ado, Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid he, whiſpering him in his Ear, here's an Adventure. Heaven grant it be a good one! quoth <hi>Sancho.</hi> But where's that ſame Maſter Adventure's Worſhip? Where! doſt thou ask, <hi>Sancho?</hi> Why, turn thy Head, Man, and look yonder. Doſt thou not ſee a Knight-Errant there lying on the Ground? I have reaſon to think he is in Melancholick Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, for I ſaw him fling himſelf off from his Horſe, and ſtretch himſelf on the Ground in a diſconſolate manner, and his Armour claſh'd as he fell. What of all that, quoth <hi>Sancho?</hi> How do you make this to be an Adventure? I will not yet affirm, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> that 'tis an Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but a very fair Riſe to one as ever was ſeen. But hark! he's tuning ſome Inſtrument, and by his coughing and ſpitting he's clearing his Throat to ſing. Troth now, Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> 'tis e'en ſo in good earneſt; and I fancy 'tis ſome Knight that's in Love. All Knight-Errants muſt be ſo,
<pb n="737" facs="tcp:54446:403"/>
anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote.</hi> But lets us hearken, and if he ſings, we ſhall know more of his Circumſtances preſently; for out of the Abundance of the Heart the Mouth ſpeaks. <hi>Sancho</hi> wou'd have anſwer'd, but that the Knight of the Wood's Voice, which was but indifferent, interrupted him with the following

                        <p>The Knight of the Wood concluded his Song with a Sigh, that ſeem'd to be fetch'd from the very bottom of his Heart; and after ſome pauſe, with a mournful and diſconſolate Voice: Oh the
<pb n="738" facs="tcp:54446:404"/>
moſt Beautiful, but moſt Ungrateful of Woman-kind, cry'd he, how is it poſſible, moſt Serene <hi>Caſildea de Vandalia,</hi> your Heart ſhou'd conſent that a Knight who idolizes your Charms, ſhould waſte the Flower of his Youth, and kill himſelf with continual Wandrings and hard Fatigues? Is it not enough, that I have made you to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd the greateſt Beauty in the World, by all the Knights of <hi>Navarre,</hi> all the Knights of <hi>Leon,</hi> all the <hi>Tarteſians,</hi> all the <hi>Caſtilians,</hi> and, in fine, by all the Knights of <hi>La Mancha?</hi> Not ſo neither, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote</hi> then; for I my ſelf am of <hi>La Mancha,</hi> and never acknowledg'd nor ever cou'd, nor ought to acknowledge a Thing ſo injurious to the Beauty of my Miſtreſs; therefore, <hi>Sancho,</hi> 'tis a plain caſe, this Knight is out of his Senſes. But let us hearken; perhaps we ſhall diſcover ſomething more. That you will, I'll warrant you, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> for he ſeems in Tune to hoan a Month together. But it happen'd otherwiſe; for the Knight of the Wood over-hearing them, ceas'd his Lamentation, and raiſing himſelf on his Feet, in a loud but courteous Tone call'd to them, Who's there? What are ye? Are ye of the Number of the Happy or the Miſerable? Of the Miſerable, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote.</hi> Repair to me then, ſaid the Knight of the Wood, and be aſſur'd you have met Miſery and Affliction it ſelf. Upon ſo moving and civil an Invitation, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> drew near him; and the Mournful Knight taking Don <hi>Quixote</hi> by the Hand, Sit down, ſaid he, Sir Knight, for that your Profeſſion is Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry I need no other Conviction than to have found you in this Retirement, where Solitude and the cold Night-dews are your Companions, and the proper Stations and repoſing places of Knight-Errants. I am a Knight, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi>
                           <pb n="739" facs="tcp:54446:404"/>
and of the Order you mention; and tho' my Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and Diſaſters, and Misfortunes uſurp the Seat of my Mind, I have ſtill a Heart diſpos'd to entertain the afflictions of others. Yours, as I gather by your Complaints, is deriv'd from Love, and, I ſuppoſe, owing to the Ingratitude of that Beauty you now mention'd. While they were thus parleying together, they ſate cloſe by one another on the hard-Ground, very peaceably and lovingly, and not like Men that by Break of Day were to break one another's Heads. And is it your Fortune to be in Love, ask'd the Knight of the Wood? 'Tis my Misfortune, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> tho' the pleaſant Reflection of having plac'd our affections Worthily, ſufficiently bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances the Weight of our Diſaſters, and turns them to a Bleſſing. This might be true, reply'd the Knight of the Wood, if the Diſdain of ſome Miſtreſſes were not often ſo galling to our Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, as to inſpire us with ſomething like the Spirit of Revenge. For my part, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> I never felt my Miſtreſs's Diſdain. No truly, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> who was near them, for my Lady is as gentle as a Lamb, and as ſoft as Butter. Is that your Squire, ſaid the Knight of the Wood? It is, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote.</hi> I never ſaw a Squire, ſaid the Knight of the Wood, that durſt preſume to interrupt his Maſter, when he was ſpeaking himſelf. There's my Fellow yonder; he's as big as his Father, and yet no Man can ſay he was ever ſo ſaucy as to open his Lips when I ſpoke. Well, well, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I have talk'd, and may talk again, and before as, and perhaps—but I have done—The more ye ſtir, the more 'twill ſtink. At the ſame time the Squire of the Wood pulling <hi>Sancho</hi> by the Arm, come Brother, ſaid he, let us two go where we may chat freely by our
<pb n="740" facs="tcp:54446:405"/>
ſelves, like downright Squires as we are, and let our Maſters get over Head and Ears in the Stories of their Loves: I'll warrant ye they'll be at it all Night, and won't have done by that time 'tis Day. With all my Heart, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> and then I'll tell you who I am, and what I am, and you ſhall judge if I am not fit to make one among the talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Squires. With that the two Squires with-drew, and had a Dialogue, as Comical as that of their Maſters was Serious.</p>

                        <p>THE Knights and their Squires thus divided, the latter to tell their Lives, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to relate their Amours; the Story begins with the Squire of the Wood. Sir, ſaid he to <hi>Sancho,</hi> this is a troubleſome kind of Life, that we Squires of Knight-Errants lead: Well may we ſay, we eat our Bread with the ſweat of our Brows; which is one of the Curſes laid on our firſt Parents. Well may we ſay too, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> we eat it with a cold Shivering of our Bodies; for there are no poor Creatures that ſuffer more by heat or cold than we do. Nay, if we cou'd but eat at all, 'twou'd never vex one; for good Fare leſſens Care; but ſometimes we ſhall go ye a Day or two, and never
<pb n="741" facs="tcp:54446:405"/>
ſo much as breakfaſt, unleſs it be upon the Wind that blows. After all, ſaid the Squire of the Wood; we may bear with this, when we think of the reward we are to expect; for that ſame Knight-Errant muſt be exceſſively Unfortunate, that has not ſome time or other the Government of ſome Iſland, or ſome good handſome Earldom, to beſtow on his Squire. As for me, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I have often told my Maſter, I wou'd be contented with the Government of any Iſland; and he is ſo Noble and Free-hearted, that he has promis'd it me over and over. For my part, quoth the other Squire, I ſhou'd think my ſelf well paid for my Services with ſome good Canonry, and I have my Maſter's Word for it too. Why then, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like your Maſter is ſome Church-Knight, and may beſtow ſuch Living<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But mine is purely Laick; ſome of his wiſe Friends in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed (no thanks to them for it) once upon a time counſell'd him to be an Archbiſhop: I fancy they wiſh'd him no good, but he wou'd not; for he'll be nothing but an Emperor. I was plaguily afraid he might have had a hankering after the Church, and ſo have ſpoil'd my Preferment, I not being gifted that way; for between you and I, tho' I look like a Man in a Doublet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſhou'd make but an Aſs in a Caſſock. Let me tell you, Friend, quoth the Squire of the Wood, that you are out in your Politicks; for theſe Iſland-Governments bring more Coſt than Worſhip; there's a great Cry, but little Wool; the beſt will bring more Trouble and Care than they are worth, and thoſe that take 'em on their Shoulders are ready to ſink under 'em. I think it were better for us to quit this confounded Slavery, and e'en jog home, where me may have better Paſtimes. There we may have Fiſhing, and Hunting, and the lik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

for he's a ſorry Country-Squire indeed, that wants his Horſe, his couple of Hounds, or his Fiſhing-Tackle, to live pleaſantly at Home. All this I can have at Will, quoth <hi>Sancho:</hi> Indeed I have ne'er a Nag; but I have an honeſt Aſs here worth two of my Maſter's Horſes any Day in the Year. A bad <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> be my Lot, and may it be the next, if I wou'd ſwop Beaſts with him, tho' he gave me four Buſhels of Barley to boot, no marry wou'd not I: Laugh as much as you will at the value I ſet on my <hi>Dapple;</hi> for <hi>Dapple</hi> you muſt know is his Colour. Now as for Hounds we have enough to ſpare in our Town; and there's no Sport like Hunting at another Man's Coſt. Faith and Troth! Brother Squire, quoth the Squire of the Wood, I am fully ſet upon't. Theſe Vagrant Knights may e'en ſeek their mad Adventures by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for me.

<pb n="743" facs="tcp:54446:406"/>
Tongue between your Teeth, or ſpeak as you ought. Methinks your Maſter ſhou'd have taught you better Manners; for Knight-Errants are the very pink of Courteſie. Alas, quoth the Squire of the Wood, how you're miſtaken! how little you know the way of praiſing People now a-days! Have you never obſerv'd when any Gentleman at a Bull-Feaſt gives the Bull a home Thruſt with his Lance, or when any Body behaves himſelf clever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon any Occaſion; The People will Cry out, What a brisk Son of a Whore that is! a clever Dog, I'll warrant him. So what ſeems to be Slander, in that Senſe is notable Commendation: And be advis'd by me, don't think thoſe Children worth the owning, who won't do that which may make their Parents be commended in that Faſhion. Nay, if it be ſo, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I'll diſown 'em if they don't; and henceforth you may call my Wife and Daughter all the Whores and Bawds you can think on, and welcome; for they do a thouſand things that deſerve all theſe fine Names. Heav'n ſend me once more to ſee them, and deliver me out of this Mortal Sin of Squire-Erranting, which I have been drawn into a ſecond time, by the wicked Bait of a hundred Ducats, which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil threw in my own way in <hi>Sierra Morena,</hi> and which he ſtill Haunts me with, and brings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Eyes here and there and every where. Oh that plaguy Purſe, 'tis ſtill running in my Head, methinks I am counting ſuch another o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and over! Now I hug it, now I carry it home, now I'm buying Land with it; now I let Leaſes, now I'm receiving my Rents, and live like a Prince! Thus I paſs away the time, and this lulls me on to drudge on to the end of the Chapter, with this Dunder-headed Maſter of mine, who to my knowledge is more a Madman than
<pb n="744" facs="tcp:54446:407"/>
a Knight. Truly, ſaid the Squire of the Wood, this makes the Proverb true, Covetouſneſs breaks the Sack. And now you talk of Madmen, I think my Maſter is worſe than yours; for he is one of thoſe, of whom the Proverb ſays, Fools will be meddling; and, who meddles with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Man's Buſineſs, Milks his Cow into a Sieve. In ſearching after another Knight's Wits, he loſes his own; and Hunts up and down for that, which may make him rue the finding. And is not the Poor Man in Love, quoth <hi>Sancho?</hi> I marry, ſaid t'other, and with one <hi>Caſildea de Vandalia,</hi> one of the oddeſt Pieces in the World; ſhe'll neither Roaſt nor Boil, and is neither Fiſh Fleſh nor good Red Herring. But that's not the Thing that Plagues his Noddle now. He has ſome other Crotchets in his Crown, and you'll hear more of it e'er long. There is no way ſo ſmooth, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but it has ſome hole or rub in't to make a Body ſtumble. In ſome Houſes they Boil Beans, and in mine are whole Kettles full. So Madneſs has more need of good Attendants than Wiſdom. But if the old Saying be true, that it lightens Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to have Companions in our Grief, you are the fitteſt to comfort me; you ſerve one Fool and I another. My Maſter, quoth the Squire of the Wood, is more ſtout than fooliſh, but more Knave than either. Mine is not like yours then, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> he has not one grain of Knavery in him; he's as dull as an old crack'd Pitcher, hurts no Body, does all the good he can to every Body, a Child may perſwade him it is Night at Noon-Day, and he is ſo ſimple, that I can't help loving him with all my Heart and Soul, and can't leave him, in ſpight of all his Follies. Have a care, Brother, ſaid the Squire of the Wood, when the Blind leads the Blind, both may fall into the Ditch. 'Tis
<pb n="745" facs="tcp:54446:407"/>
better to wheel about fair and ſoftly, and ſteal home again to our own Fire-ſides; for thoſe who follow their Noſe are often led into a ſtink: Here the Squire of the Wood obſerving that <hi>Sancho</hi> ſpit very often and very dry, I fancy, Brother, ſaid he, that our Tongues ſtick to the Palats of our Mouths with Talking; but to cure that Diſeaſe I have ſomething that hangs to the Pummel of my Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, as good as ever was tipp'd over Tongue. Then he went and took down a Leather-Bottle of Wine, and a cold Pye at leaſt half a Yard long; which is no Fiction, for <hi>Sancho</hi> himſelf, when he laid his Hands on it, took it rather for a bak'd Goat than a Kid; though it was indeed but an over-grown Rabbit. What! ſaid <hi>Sancho</hi> at the ſight, did you bring this too abroad with you? What d'you think, ſaid t'other? Do you take me for one of your Freſh-water Squires? I'd have you know I carry as good Proviſion at my Horſe's Crupper, as any General upon his March. <hi>Sancho</hi> did not ſtay for an Invitation, but fell to in the Dark, cramming down Morſels as big as his Fift. Ay marry, Sir, ſaid he, you are a Squire every Inch of you, a true and truſty, round and ſound, noble and free-hearted Squire. This good Cheer is a proof of it, which I don't ſay jump'd hither by Witch-craft; but one would almoſt think ſo. Now here ſits poor wretched I, that have nothing in my Knapſack but a Cruſt of Cheeſe, ſo hard, a Giant might break his Grinders in't, and a few Acorns, Walnuts and Filberds; a ſhame on my Maſter's Niggardly Temper, and his Curſed Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, in fancying that all Knight-Errants muſt live on a little dry'd Fruit and Sallets. Well, well, Brother, reply'd the Squire of the Wood, our Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters may Diet themſelves, by rules of Chivalry, if they pleaſe; your Thiſtles, and your Herbs and
<pb n="746" facs="tcp:54446:408"/>
Roots don't well agree with my Stomach: I muſt have good Meat, i'faith! and this Bottle here ſtill at Hand at the Pummel of my Saddle. 'Tis my Joy, my Life, the Comfort of my Soul, I hug and kiſs it every Moment, and now recommend it to you as the beſt Friend in the World. <hi>Sancho</hi> took the Bottle, and rearing it to his thirſty Lips, with his Eyes fix'd upon the Stars, kept himſelf in that happy Contemplation for a quarter of an Hour together. At laſt, when he had taken his Draught, with a deep Groan, a Nod on one ſide and a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Leer, Oh! the Son of a Whore! What rare and Catholick Bub it is! Oh ho! quoth the Squire of the Wood, have I caught you at your Son of a Whores! I told you ſo now that it was a way of commending a thing. I knock under, quoth <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> and own 'tis no diſhonour to call one a Son of a Whore when we mean to praiſe him. But now, by the Remembrance of her you Love beſt, prithee tell me, is not this your right <hi>Ciudad-Real</hi> Wine? Thou haſt a rare Palate, anſwer'd the Squire of the Wood, 'tis the very ſame, and of a good ſtanding too. I knew it faith! ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> is not this ſtrange now? Turn me looſe among a parcel of Wines to find the Difference: Adad! Sir, I no ſooner clap my Noſe to a Taſter of Wine, but I can tell the Place, the Grape, the Flavour, the Age, the Strength, and all the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the Parcel: And all this is natural to me, Sir; for I had two Relations by the Father's-ſide that were the niceſt Taſters that were known of a long time in <hi>La Mancha;</hi> of which two I'll re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late you a Story that makes good what I ſaid. It fell out on a time, that ſome Wine was drawn freſh out of a Hogſhead, and given to theſe ſame Friends of mine to Taſte; and they were ask'd their Opinions of the Condition, the Quality, the
<pb n="747" facs="tcp:54446:408"/>
Goodneſs, the Badneſs of the Wine, and all that. The one try'd it with the tip of his Tongue, the other only ſmell'd it; the firſt ſaid the Wine taſted of Iron; the ſecond ſaid it rather had a Tang of Goat's Leather. The Vintner ſwore his Veſſel was clean, and the Wine Neat, and ſo Pure that it could have no Taſte of any ſuch thing. Well, Time ran on, the Wine was Sold, and when the Veſſel came to be empty'd, what do you think, Sir, was found in the Cask? A little Key, with a bit of Leathern Thong ty'd to't: Now, judge you by this, whether he that comes of ſuch a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration has not reaſon to underſtand Wine? More reaſon than to underſtand Adventures, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd the other: Therefore ſince we have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, let's not trouble our ſelves to look after more, but e'en jog home to our little Cots, where Heav'n will find us, if it be its Will. I intend, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> to wait on my Maſter till we come to <hi>Saragoſſa,</hi> but then I'll turn over a new Leaf. To conclude: The two friendly Squires having talk'd and drank, and held out almoſt as long as their Bottle, it was high time that Sleep ſhould lay their Tongues, and aſſwage their Thirſt, for to quench it was impoſſible. Accordingly they had no ſooner fill'd their Bellies, but they fell faſt aſleep, both keeping their hold on their almoſt empty Bottle. Where we ſhall for a while leave 'em to their reſt, and ſee what paſs'd between their Maſters.</p>

                        <p>MANY were the Diſcourſes that paſs'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Don <hi>Quixote</hi> and the Knight of the Wood: Amongſt the reſt, You muſt know, Sir Knight, ſaid the latter, that by the appointment of Fate, or rather by my own Choice, I became Enamour'd of the Peerleſs <hi>Caſildea de Vandalia.</hi> I call her Peerleſs, becauſe ſhe is ſingular in the greatneſs of her Stature, as well as in that of her State and Beauty. But this Lady has been pleas'd to take no other notice of my honourable Paſſion, than in employing me in many Perillous Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, like <hi>Hercules</hi>'s Step-mother; ſtill promiſing me, after I had put an happy end to one, that the performance of the next ſhould put me in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my Deſires. But after a Succeſſion of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs Labours, I do not know which of her Commands will be the laſt, and will crown my Lawful Wiſhes. Once by her particular Injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I Challeng'd that famous Gianteſs <hi>La Giralda</hi> of <hi>Sevill,</hi> who is as ſtrong and undaunted as one that is made of Braſs, and who, without changing Place; is the moſt changeable and unconſtant Woman in the World; I went, I ſaw, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came: I made her ſtand ſtill, and fix'd her in a conſtant Point, for the ſpace of a whole Week; no Wind having blown in the Skies during all that time but the North. Another time ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd
<pb n="749" facs="tcp:54446:409"/>
me to remove the ancient Stones of the ſturdy Bulls of <hi>Guiſando;</hi> a Task more ſuitable to the Arms of Porters than thoſe of Knights; then ſhe commanded me to deſcend and dive into the Cave of <hi>Cabra,</hi> (a terrible and unheard of Attempt) and to bring her an account of all the Wonders in that diſmal Profundity. I ſtopp'd the Motion of <hi>La Giralda,</hi> I weigh'd the Bulls of <hi>Guiſando;</hi> and with a precipitated Fall plung'd to the diſtant bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Den, and brought to light the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> ſtill my hopes are dead. How dead? How, becauſe her Diſdain ſtill lives, lives to enjoyn me new Labours, new Exploits. For, laſtly ſhe has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd me to traverſe the remoteſt Provinces of <hi>Spain,</hi> and exact a Confeſſion from all the Knight-Errants that Roam about the Land, that her Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty alone excells that of all other. Women, and that I am the moſt valiant and moſt enamour'd Knight in the World. I have already journey'd over the greateſt part of <hi>Spain</hi> on this Expedition, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come many Knights who had the Temerity to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict my Aſſertion: But the perfection of my Glory, is the Reſult of my Victory over the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown'd Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> whom I Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd in ſingle Combat, and compell'd to ſubmit his <hi>Dulcinea</hi>'s to my <hi>Caſildea</hi>'s Beauty. And now I reckon the wandring Knights of the whole Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe all vanquiſh'd by my Proweſs: Their Fame, their Glory and their Honours being all veſted in this great Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> who had before made them the Spoils of his Valorous Arm; though now they muſt attend the Triumphs of my Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which is the greater, ſince the Reputation of the Conquerour riſes in proportion to that of the Vanquiſh'd; and all the latter's Laurels are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to me.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="750" facs="tcp:54446:410"/>Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was amaz'd to hear the Knight run on at this rate, and had the Lye ready at his Tongue's-end to give him a thouſand times; but deſigning to make him own his Falſity with his own Mouth, he ſtrove to contain his Choler; and arguing the Matter very calmly, Sir Knight, ſaid he, That your Victories have extended over all the Knights in <hi>Spain,</hi> and perhaps over the whole World, I will not diſpute; but that you have van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> you muſt give me leave to doubt: It might be ſome body like him; tho' he is a Perſon whom but very few can reſemble. What d'ye mean? Anſwer'd the Knight of the Wood: By yond ſpangled Canopy of the Skies, I fought Don <hi>Quixote</hi> hand to hand, van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd him, and made him ſubmit; he is a tall wither-fac'd, leathern-jaw'd Fellow, ſcragged, griz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle-hair'd, Hawk-nos'd, and wears long, black, lank Muſtachio's: He is diſtinguiſh'd in the Field by the Title of the Knight of the <hi>Woeful Figure:</hi> He beſtrides and manages that far-fam'd Courſer <hi>Rozinante;</hi> and has for the Miſtreſs of his Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, one <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo,</hi> ſometimes call'd <hi>Aldon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa Lorenzo;</hi> as mine, whoſe Name was <hi>Caſildea,</hi> and who is of <hi>Andaluſia,</hi> is now diſtinguiſh'd by the Denomination of <hi>Caſildea de Vandalia:</hi> and if all theſe convincing Marks be not ſufficient to prove this Truth, I wear a Sword that ſhall force even Incredulity to Credit it. Not ſo faſt good Sir Knight, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> pray attend to what I ſhall deliver upon this Head: you muſt know that this ſame Don <hi>Quixote</hi> is the greateſt Friend I have in the World; inſomuch that I may ſay I love him as well as I do my ſelf. Now the Tokens that you have deſcrib'd him by, are ſo agreeable to his Perſon and Circumſtances, that one would think he ſhould be the Perſon you Subdu'd. On
<pb n="751" facs="tcp:54446:410"/>
the other hand, I am convinc'd by the more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Argument of undeniable Senſe, that it cannot be he. But thus far I will allow you, as there are many Inchanters that are his Enemies, eſpecially one whoſe Malice hourly perſecutes him, perhaps one of them has aſſum'd his Likeneſs, thus by a Counterfeit Conqueſt to defraud him of the Glory contracted by his ſignal Chivalry over all-the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. In confirmation of which I can further tell you, 'tis but two Days ago that theſe envious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians transform'd the Figure and Perſon of the Beautiful <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo</hi> into the baſe and ſordid likeneſs of a Ruſtic Wench. And if this will not convince you of your Errour, behold Don <hi>Quixote</hi> himſelf in Perſon, that here ſtands ready to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Words with his Arms, either a Foot or on Horſeback, or in what other manner you may think convenient. As he ſaid this, up he ſtarted, and laid his Hand to his Sword, expecting the Motions and Reſolutions of the Knight of the Wood. But with a great deal of Calmneſs, Sir, ſaid he, a good Pay-maſter grudges no Surety: He that could once vanquiſh Don <hi>Quixote</hi> when transform'd, needs not fear him in his proper Shape. But ſince Darkneſs is not proper for the Atchievements of Knights, but rather for Robbers and Ruffians, let us expect the Morning-light, that the Sun may be a Witneſs of our Valour. The Conditions of our Combat ſhall be, That the Conquer'd ſhall be wholly at the Mercy of the Conquerour, who ſhall diſpoſe of him at Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; provided always he abuſes not his Power, by commanding any thing unworthy the Honour of Knighthood. Content, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> I like theſe Terms very well. With that they both went to look out their Squires, whom they found ſnoaring very ſoundly in the very ſame poſture as
<pb n="752" facs="tcp:54446:411"/>
when they firſt fell aſleep. They rouz'd them up; and order'd them to get their Steeds ready; for, the firſt Rays of the riſing Sun muſt behold them engage in a Bloody and unparallell'd ſingle Combat. This News Thunder-ſtruck <hi>Sancho,</hi> and put him to his Wits-end for his Maſter's Danger; having heard the Knight of the Wood's Courage ſtrangely magnify'd by his Squire. However, without the leaſt reply he went with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion to ſeek their Beaſts, who by this time had ſmell'd out one another and were got lovingly all together. Well Friend, ſaid the Squire to <hi>Sancho</hi> as they went, I find our Maſter's are to fight; ſo you and I are like to have a Bruſh too; for 'tis the way among us <hi>Andaluſians,</hi> not to let the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds ſtand idly by, with Arms a-croſs, while their Friends are at it. This, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> may be a Cuſtom in your Country; but let me tell you, 'tis a damn'd Cuſtom, Sir Squire, and none but Ruffians and Bloody-minded Fellows would ſtand up for't: But there's no ſuch Practice among Squires Errant, elſe my Maſter would have minded me of it e'er this; for he has all the Laws of Knight-Errantry by Heart. But ſuppoſe there be ſuch a Law, I will not obey it, that's flat: I'll rather pay the Penalty that's laid on ſuch Peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Squires: I don't think the Fine can be above two pounds of Wax, and that will coſt me leſs than the Lint would to make Tents for my Scull, which methinks is already cleft down to my Chin. Beſides, how would you have me Fight? I have ne'er a Sword, nor ever wore any. No matter, quoth the Squire of the Wood, I've a Cure for that Sore. I ha' got here a couple of Linnen-Bags, both of a ſize, you ſhall take one, and I t'other, and ſo we'll let drive one at one another with theſe equal Weapons. Ay, ay, with all my
<pb n="753" facs="tcp:54446:411"/>
Heart, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> this will duſt our Jackets purely, and won't hurt our Skins. Not ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, reply'd the Squire of the Wood; for we'll put half a dozen of ſmooth Stones into each Bag, that the Wind mayn't blow 'em to and fro, and they may play the better, and ſo we may bruſh one another's Coats cleverly, and yet do our ſelves no great hurt. Body of my Father! quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> what ſoft Sable-Fur, what dainty carded Cotton and Lambs-wool he crams into the Bags, to hinder our making Pap of our Brains, and Touch-wood of our Bones! But I ſay again and again, I am not in a humour to Fight, though they were only full of Silk-balls. Let our Maſters Fight, and hear on't in another World; but let us drink and live while we may, for why ſhould we ſtrive to end our Lives before their Time and Seaſon; and be ſo eager to gather the Plums that will drop of themſelves, when they're ripe? Well, ſaid the Squire of the Wood, for all that, we muſt Fight half an Hour or ſo. Not a Minute, reply'd <hi>Sancho:</hi> I han't the Heart to quarrel with a Gentleman with whom I have been eating and drinking. I an'c angry with you in the leaſt, and were I to be hang'd for't, I could never fight in cold Blood. Nay, if that be all, ſaid the Squire of the Wood, you ſhall be angry enough, I'll warrant you; for, before we go to't, d'ye ſee, I'll walk up very handſomely to you, and lend your Worſhip three or four ſound ſlaps o' the Chaps, and knock you down; which will be ſure to awaken your Choler, though it ſlept as ſound as a Dormouſe. Nay then, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I have a Trick for your Trick, if that be all, and you ſhall have as good as you bring; for I will take me a pretty middling Leaver (you underſtand me) and before you can waken my Choler, will
<pb n="754" facs="tcp:54446:412"/>
I lay yours aſleep ſo faſt, that it ſhall never wake more, unleſs in t'other World; where 'tis well known, I am one will let no Man's Fiſt duſt my Noſe. Let every Man look before he Leaps. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny come for Wooll, that go home ſhorn. No Man knows what another can do: So, Friend, let every Man's Choler ſleep with him; Bleſſed are the Peace-makers, and Curſed are the Peace-breakers. A Baited Cat may turn as fierce as a Lion. Who knows then what I that am a Man may turn to, if I'm provok'd. Take it therefore for a Warning from me, Sir Squire, that all the Miſchief you may be hatching in this manner ſhall lie at your Door. Well, ſaid t'other, 'twill be Day anon, and then we ſhall ſee what's to be done.</p>
                        <p>And now a thouſand ſorts of pretty Birds began to warble in the Trees, and with their various chearful Notes ſeem'd to ſalute the freſh <hi>Aurora,</hi> who then diſplay'd her riſing Beauties through the Gates and Arches of the Eaſt, and gently ſhook from her dewy Locks a Shower of liquid Pearls, ſprinkling and inriching the verdant Meads with that reviving Treaſure, which ſeem'd to ſpring and drop from the bending Leaves. The Willows diſtill'd their delicious Manna, the Rivulets fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly murmur'd, the Fountains ſmil'd, the Woods were cheer'd, and Fields enrich'd at her Approach. But no ſooner the dawning Light recall'd Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, than the firſt thing that preſented it ſelf to <hi>Sancho</hi>'s View, was the Squire of the Wood's Noſe, which was ſo big that it over-ſhadow'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt his whole Body. In ſhort, 'tis ſaid to have been of a monſtrous ſize, crooked in the middle, ſtudded with Warts and Carbuncles, tawny as a Ruſſet-Pippin, and hanging down ſome two Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers below his Mouth. The unreaſonable Bulk, diſmal Hue-Protuberancy, and Crookedneſs of that
<pb n="755" facs="tcp:54446:412"/>
Noſe, ſo disfigur'd the Squire, that <hi>Sancho</hi> was ſeiz'd with a Trembling at the Sight, and reſolv'd now to take two hundred Cuffs, before his Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler ſhould awaken to encounter ſuch a Hobgoblin. As for Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> he fix'd his Eyes upon his Antagoniſt; but as his Helmet was on, and he had pull'd down the Bever, his Face could not be ſeen; however, he obſerv'd him to be ſtrong-limb'd, though not very tall. Over his Armour he wore a Coat that look'd like Cloth of Gold, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread with Looking-glaſſes cut into the Shape of Half-Moons, which made a very glittering Show: A large Plume of yellow green and white Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wav'd about his Helmet; and his Lance, which he had ſet up againſt a Tree, was very thick and long, with a Steel-Head a Foot in length. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ſurvey'd every particular, and from his Obſervations judg'd him to be a Man of great Strength. But all this was ſo far from daunting his Courage, like <hi>Sancho,</hi> that, with a gallant De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, Sir Knight of the Mirrours, ſaid he, if your eager Deſire of Combat has not made you deaf to the Entreaties of Civility, be pleas'd to lift up your Bever a while, that I may ſee whether the Gracefulneſs of your Face equals that of your Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Whether you be Vanquiſh'd or Victorious in this Enterprize, anſwer'd the Knight of the Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, you ſhall have Leiſure enough to ſee my Face: I cannot at preſent ſatisfy your Curioſity; for every Moment of Delay from Combat is, in my Thoughts, a Wrong done to the Beautiful <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſildea de Vandalia.</hi> However, reply'd Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote,</hi> while we get a Horſeback, you may tell me whether I be the ſame Don <hi>Quixote</hi> whom you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have overcome? To this I anſwer you, ſaid the Knight of the Mirrours, you are as like the Knight I vanquiſh'd as one Egg is like another.
<pb n="756" facs="tcp:54446:413"/>
But conſidering what you tell me, that you are perſecuted by Inchanters, I dare not affirm that you are the ſame. 'Tis enough for me, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> that you believe you may be in Error; but that I may entirely prove your Doubts, let's to Horſe; for, if Providence, my Miſtreſs, and my Arm aſſiſt me, I will ſee your Face in leſs time than it would have coſt you to have lifted up your Bever, and make you know that I am not that Don <hi>Quixote</hi> whom you talk'd of having Vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This ſaid, without any more Words they Mounted. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> wheel'd about with <hi>Rozi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nante,</hi> to take Ground for the Career: The Knight of the Mirrours did the like. But before Don <hi>Quixote</hi> had rid twenty Paces he heard him call to him: So meeting each other half way, Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Sir Knight, cry'd he, the Conditions on which we Fight; The Vanquiſh'd as I told you before, ſhall be at the Mercy of the Conqueror. I grant it anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> provided the Victor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes nothing on him that derogates from the Laws of Chivalry. I mean no otherwiſe, reply'd the Knight of the Mirrours. At the ſame time Don <hi>Quixote</hi> happen'd to caſt his Eye on the Squire's ſtrange Noſe, and wonder'd no leſs at the Sight of it than <hi>Sancho,</hi> taking him to be rather a Monſter than a Man. <hi>Sancho</hi> ſeeing his Maſter ſet out to take ſo much Diſtance as was fit to return on his Enemy with greater Force, would not truſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alone with Squire <hi>Noſe,</hi> fearing the greater ſhould be too hard for the leſs, and either that or Fear ſhould ſtrike him to the Ground. This made him run after his Maſter, till he had taken hold of <hi>Rozinante</hi>'s Stirrup<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Leathers; and when he thought him ready to turn back to take his Career; good your Worſhip, cry'd he, before you run upon your Enemy help me to get up into yon Cork-Tree,
<pb n="757" facs="tcp:54446:413"/>
where I may better, and much more to my liking, ſee your brave Battle with the Knight. I rather believe, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> thou want'ſt to be pearch'd up yonder as on a Scaffold, to ſee the Bull-baiting without Danger. To tell you the Truth, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that Fellow's unconſcionable Noſe has ſo frighted me, that I dare not ſtay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his reach. It is indeed ſuch a Sight, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> as might affect with Fear any other but my ſelf; and therefore come, I'll help thee up. Now while <hi>Sancho</hi> was climbing up the Tree, with his Maſter's Aſſiſtance, the Knight of the Mirrors took as much Ground as he thought proper for his Career; and imagining Don <hi>Quixote</hi> had done the ſame, he fac'd about, without expecting the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet's Sound or any other Signal for a Charge, and with his Horſe's full Speed, which was no more than a middling Trot, (for he was neither more promiſing nor a better Performer than <hi>Rozinante</hi>) he went to encounter his Enemy. But ſeeing him buſy in helping up his Squire, he held in his Steed, and ſtopp'd in the middle of the Career, for which the Horſe was mightily oblig'd to him, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſcarceable to ſtir a foot farther. Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> who thought his Enemy was flying upon him, ſet Spurs to <hi>Rozinante</hi>'s hinder Flank vigorouſly, and ſo waken'd his Mettle, that the Story ſays, this was the only Time he was known to Gallop a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, for at all others, downright Trotting was his beſt. With this unuſual Fury he ſoon got to the Place where his Opponent was ſtriking his Spurs into his Horſe's Sides up to the very Rowels, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being able to make him ſtir an Inch from the Spot. Now while he was thus Goading him on, and at the ſame time encumbr'd with his Lance, either not knowing how to ſet it in the Reſt, or wanting Tim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="758" facs="tcp:54446:414"/>
no notice of his Diſorder, Encounter'd him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Danger, ſo furiouſly, that the Knight of the Mirrors was hurry'd in ſpight of his Teeth over his Horſe's Crupper; and was ſo hurt with falling to the Ground, that he lay without Motion, or any Sign of Life. <hi>Sancho</hi> no ſooner ſaw him fallen, but down he comes ſliding from the Tree, and runs to his Maſter, who having diſmounted, was got upon the Knight of the Mirrors, and was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacing his Helmet, to ſee if he were dead or alive, and give him Air. But who can relate what he ſaw, when he ſaw the Face of the Knight of the Mirrors, without raiſing Wonder, Amazement or Aſtoniſhment in thoſe that ſhall hear it? He ſaw, ſays the Hiſtory, in that Face, the very Viſage, the very Aſpect, the very Phyſiognomy, the very Make, the very Features, the very Effigy of the Batchelor <hi>Sampſon Carraſco.</hi> Come <hi>Sancho,</hi> cry'd he as he ſaw it, come hither, look and admire what thou may'ſt ſee, yet not believe. Haſte, my Friend, and mark the Power of Magick; What Sorcerers and Inchanters can do! <hi>Sancho</hi> drew near, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Batchelor <hi>Sampſon Carraſco</hi>'s Face, began to Croſs himſelf a thouſand times, and Bleſs himſelf as many more. The poor defeated Knight all this while gave no Sign of Life: Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho</hi> to his Maſter, if you'll be rul'd by me, make ſure work: Right or wrong, e'en thruſt your Sword down this Fellow's Throat that's ſo like the Batchelour <hi>Sampſon Carraſco;</hi> and ſo mayhaps in him you may chance to murder one of thoſe bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Dogs thoſe Inchanters that haunt you ſo. That Thought's not amiſs, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> and with that drawing his Sword, he was going to put <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi>'s Advice in Execution, when the Knight's Squire came running without the Noſe that ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd him before; and calling to Don <hi>Quixote;</hi>
                           <pb n="759" facs="tcp:54446:414"/>
Hold, Noble Don <hi>Quixote</hi> cry'd he! Take heed! Beware! 'Tis your Friend <hi>Sampſon Carraſco</hi> that now lies at your Worſhip's Mercy, and I am his Squire. And where's your Noſe, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him now without his Diſguiſe? Here in my Pocket, anſwer'd the Squire; and ſo ſaying he pull'd out the Noſe of a Varniſh'd Paſte-board Viz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, ſuch as it has been deſcrib'd. <hi>Sancho</hi> having more and more ſtar'd him in the Face with great Earneſtneſs, Bleſſed Virgin defend me, quoth he! Who's this? <hi>Thomas Cecial,</hi> my Friend and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour? The ſame Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth the Squire? I'll tell you anon by what Tricks and Wheadles he was inveagl'd to come hither. Mean while deſire your Maſter not to miſuſe, nor ſlay, nor meddle in the leaſt with the Knight of the Mirrors, that now lies at his Mercy; for there's nothing more ſure than that 'tis our ill-advis'd Countryman <hi>Sampſon Carraſco,</hi> and no body elſe.</p>
                        <p>By this time the Knight of the Mirrors began to come to himſelf; which when Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, ſetting the Point of his Sword to his Throat, Thou dy'ſt, Knight, cry'd he, if thou refuſe to confeſs that the peerleſs <hi>Dulcinea del Tobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo</hi> excells thy <hi>Caſildea de Vandalia</hi> in Beauty. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, thou ſhalt promiſe (if thou eſcape with Life from this Combat) to go to the City of <hi>Toboſo;</hi> where, as from me, thou ſhalt preſent thy ſelf before the Miſtreſs of my Deſires, and reſign thy Perſon to her Diſpoſal: If ſhe leaves thee to thy own, then thou ſhalt come back to me, (for the Track of my Exploits will be thy Guide) and thou ſhalt give me an Account of the Tranſactions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her and thee. Theſe Conditions are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to our Agreement before the Combat, and do not tranſgreſs the Rules of Knight-Erran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. I do confeſs, ſaid the diſcomfited Knight,
<pb n="760" facs="tcp:54446:415"/>
that the Lady <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo</hi>'s ripp'd and dirty Shooe is preferable to the clean, though ill-comb'd Locks of <hi>Caſildea;</hi> and I promiſe to go to her, and come from her Preſence to yours, and bring you a full and true Relation of all you have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd me. You ſhall alſo confeſs and believe, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> that the Knight you vanquiſh'd neither was nor could be Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> but ſome body elſe in his likeneſs; as I on the other ſide do confeſs and believe, that though you ſeem to be the Batchelor <hi>Sampſon Carraſco,</hi> you are not he, but ſome other whom my Enemies have transformed into his Reſemblance, to aſſwage the Violence of my Wrath, and make me entertain with Moderation the Glory of my Victory. All this I confeſs, believe and allow, ſaid the Knight; and now I beſeech you let me riſe, if the Hurt I have receiv'd by my Fall will give me leave; for I find my ſelf very much bruis'd. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> help'd him to riſe by the Aid of his Squire <hi>Thomas Cecial,</hi> on whom <hi>Sancho</hi> fix'd his Eyes all the while, asking him a thouſand Queſtions; the Anſwers to which convinc'd him, that he was the real <hi>Thomas Cecial,</hi> as he ſaid, though the Conceit of what was told him by his Maſter, that the Magicians had transform'd the Knight of the Mirrors into <hi>Sampſon Carraſco,</hi> had made ſuch an Impreſſion on his Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that he could not believe the Teſtimony of his own Eyes. In ſhort, the Maſter and the Man perſiſted in their Errour. The Knight of the Mirrors and his Squire, much out of Humour, and much out of Order, left Don <hi>Quixote</hi> to go to ſome Town where he might get ſome Ointments and Plaiſters for his Ribs. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd their Progreſs for <hi>Saragoſa;</hi> where the Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory leaves them, to relate who the Knight of the Mirrors and his Squire were.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Giving an Account who the Knight of the Mirrors and his Squire were.</head>
                        <p>DON <hi>Quixote</hi> went on extremely pleas'd, and joyful, priding himſelf and glorying in the Victory he had got over ſo valiant a Knight, as the Knight of the Mirrors, and relying on his Parole of Honour, which he could not violate, without forfeiting his Title to Chivalry, that he wou'd return to give him an Account of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, by which means he expected to hear whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Miſtreſs continu'd under the Bonds of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment. But Don <hi>Quixote</hi> dream'd of one thing, and the Knight of the Mirrors thought of another. His only Care for the preſent, was how to get Cur'd of his Bruiſes.</p>
                        <p>Here the Hiſtory relates, That when the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelor <hi>Carraſco</hi> advis'd Don <hi>Quixote</hi> to proceed in his former Profeſſion of Knight-Errantry, it was the Reſult of a Conference which he had with the Curate and the Barber, about the beſt means to prevail with Don <hi>Quixote</hi> to ſtay quietly at Home, and deſiſt from rambling after his unlucky Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For <hi>Carraſco</hi> thought, and ſo did the reſt, that 'twas in vain to pretend to hinder him from going abroad again, and therefore the beſt way wou'd be let him go, and that he ſhou'd meet him by the way, equipp'd like a Knight-Errant, and ſhou'd take an Opportunity to Fight, and overcome him,
<pb n="762" facs="tcp:54446:416"/>
which he might eaſily do, firſt making an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with him, that the Vanquiſh'd ſhould ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Victor's Diſcretion. So that after the Batchelor had Vanquiſh'd him, he ſhou'd com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him to return to his Houſe and Village, and not offer to depart thence in two Years, without Permiſſion; which 'twas not doubted but Don <hi>Quixote</hi> would religiouſly obſerve, for fear of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringing the Laws of Chivalry; and in this Time they hop'd he might be wean'd of his Frantick Imaginations, or they might find ſome means to Cure him of his Madneſs. <hi>Carraſco</hi> undertook this Task, and <hi>Thomas Cecial,</hi> a brisk, pleaſant Fellow, <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Neighbour and Goſſip, proffer'd to be his Squire. <hi>Sampſon</hi> equipp'd himſelf, as you have heard, and <hi>Thomas Cecial</hi> fitted a huge Paſteboard-Noſe to his own, that his Goſſip <hi>Sancho</hi> might not know him when they met. Then they follow'd Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ſo cloſe, that they had like to have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertaken him in the midſt of his Adventure with the Chariot of Death, and at laſt they found him in the Wood, that happen'd to be the Scene of their Encounter, which might have prov'd more fatal to the Batchelor, and had ſpoil'd him for ever from taking another Degree, had not Don <hi>Quixote</hi> been ſo obſtinate, in not believing him to be the ſame Man.</p>
                        <p>And now <hi>Thomas Cecial,</hi> ſeeing the ill Succeſs of their Journey; by my Troth! ſaid he, Maſter <hi>Carraſco,</hi> we have been ſerv'd well enough. 'Tis eaſy to begin a Buſineſs, but a hard matter to go through. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> is Mad, and we think our ſelves Wiſe; yet he's gone away ſound, and laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Sleeve; and your Worſhip's left here well bang'd, and in the Dumps. Now pray who's the greateſt Madman, he that is ſo becauſe he can't help it, or he that is ſo for his Pleaſure? The Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="763" facs="tcp:54446:416"/>
is, anſwer'd the Batchelor, that he that can't help being Mad, will always be ſo; but he that only plays the Fool for his Fancy, may give over when he pleaſes. Well then, quoth <hi>Cecial,</hi> I, who was pleas'd to play the Fool in going a Squire-Erranting with your Worſhip, for the ſelf-ſame Reaſon will give it over now, and e'en make the beſt of my way home again. Do as you will, reply'd <hi>Carraſco,</hi> but 'tis a Folly to think I ever will go home, till I have ſwingingly paid that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable Madman. 'Tis not that he may reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Wits neither: No, 'tis pure Revenge now, for the Pain in my Bones won't give me leave to have any manner of Charity for him. Thus they went on Diſcourſing, till at laſt they got to a Town, where, by good Fortune, they met with a Bone-ſetter, who gave the Bruis'd Batchelor ſome Eaſe. <hi>Thomas Cecial</hi> left him, and went Home, while the other ſtay'd to meditate Revenge. In due time the Hiſtory will ſpeak of him again, but muſt not now forget to entertain you with Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Joy.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>DON <hi>Quixote</hi> purſu'd his Journey, full, as we ſaid before, of Joy and Satisfaction; his late Victory made him eſteem himſelf the moſt Valiant Knight-Errant of the Age. He counted all his future Adventures as already finiſh'd and
<pb n="764" facs="tcp:54446:417"/>
happily atchiev'd. He defy'd all Inchantments and Enchanters. No longer did he remember the innumerable Blows he had receiv'd in the Courſe of his Errantry; nor the ſhower of Stones that had daſh'd out half of his Teeth, nor the Ingratitude of the Galley-Slaves, nor the Inſolence of the <hi>Tangueſian</hi> Carriers, that had ſo abominably batter'd his Ribs with their Pack-ſtaves. In ſhort, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with himſelf, that if he cou'd but by any manner of means diſſolve the Inchantment of his ador'd <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> he ſhould have no need to envy the greateſt Felicity that ever was, or ever could be attain'd by the moſt fortunate Knight in the habitable Globe. While he was wholly employ'd in theſe pleaſing Imaginations; Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho</hi> to him, is it not a pleaſant thing that I can't for the Blood of me put out of my Mind that huge unconſcionable Noſe, and whapping Noſtrils of <hi>Tomas Cecial,</hi> my Goſſip? How, <hi>Sancho,</hi> anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> do'ſt thou ſtill believe, that the Knight of the Mirrours was the Batchelor <hi>Carraſco,</hi> and that <hi>Thomas Cecial</hi> was his Squire; I don't know what to ſay to't, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but this I'm ſure, that no body but he cou'd give me thoſe Items of my Houſe, and of my Wife and Children as he did. Beſides, when his hugeous Noſe was off, he had <hi>Tom Cecial</hi>'s Face to a Hair. I ought to know it I think: I have ſeen it a hundred and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times, for we are but next-door Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; and then he had his Speech to a Tittle. Come, on, return'd Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> let us reaſon upon this Buſineſs. How can it enter into any one's Imagination, that the Batchelor <hi>Sampſon Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſco</hi> ſhou'd come Arm'd at all Points, like a Knight-Errant, on purpoſe to Fight with me? Have I ever been his Enemy, or given him any occaſion to be mine? Am I his Rival? Or has he
<pb n="765" facs="tcp:54446:417"/>
taken up the Profeſſion of Arms, in Envy of the Glory which I have purchas'd by my Sword? Ay, but then, reply'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> what ſhall we ſay to the Reſemblance between this ſame Knight, whoever he be, and the Batchelor <hi>Carraſco,</hi> and the Likeneſs between his Squire and my Goſſip? If 'tis an Inchantment, as your Worſhip ſays, were there no other People in the World but they two, to make 'em like? All, all, cry'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> is the Artifice and Deluſion of thoſe malevolent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians that Perſecute me, who, foreſeeing that I ſhou'd get the Victory, diſguis'd their Vanquiſh'd Property under the Reſemblance of my Friend, the Batchelor; that at the Sight, my Friendſhip might interpoſe between the Edge of my Sword, and moderate my juſt Reſentment, and ſo reſcue him from Death, who baſely had attempted on my Life. But thou, <hi>Sancho,</hi> by Experience, which cou'd not Deceive thee, know'ſt how eaſie a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 'tis for Magicians to Tranſmute the Face of any one into another Reſemblance, fair into foul, and foul again into fair; ſince not two Days ago, with thy own Eyes thou beheld'ſt the Peerleſs <hi>Dulcinea</hi> in her natural ſtate of Beauty and Proportion; when I, the Object of their Envy, ſaw her in the homely diſguiſe of a Blear-Ey'd, Fetid, Ugly Country-Wench. Why then ſhould'ſt thou won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſo much at the frightful Transformation of the Batchelor and thy Neighbour <hi>Cecial?</hi> But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, this is a Comfort to me, that I got the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of my Enemy, whatſoever Shape he aſſum'd. Well, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> Heaven knows the Truth of all things. This was all the Anſwer he thought fit to make; for, as he knew that the Transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of <hi>Dulcinea</hi> was only a Trick of his own, he was willing to wave the Diſcourſe, tho' he was the leſs ſatisfy'd in his Maſter's Chimera's;
<pb n="766" facs="tcp:54446:418"/>
but fear'd to drop ſome Word that might have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd his Roguery.</p>
                        <p>While they were in this Converſation; they were overtaken by a Gentleman, mounted on a very fine Flea-bitten Mare. He had on a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-Coat of fine Green Cloath, fac'd with Murry-colour'd Velvet, a Hunter's Cap of the ſame. The Furniture of his Mare was Country-like, and after the Jennet-faſhion, and alſo Murry and Green. By his Side hung a <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Scimiter, in a large Belt of Green and Gold. His Buskins were of the ſame Work with his Belt: His Spurs were not Gilt, but Burniſh'd ſo well with a certain green Varniſh, that they look'd better, to ſuit with the reſt of his Equipage, than if they had been of pure Gold. As he came up with them, he very civilly ſaluted them, and clapping Spurs to his Mare, began to leave 'em behind him. Thereupon Don <hi>Quixote</hi> call'd to him: Sir, cry'd he, if you are not in too much haſte, we ſhould be glad of the favour of your Company ſo far as you Travel this Road. Indeed, anſwer'd the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, I had not thus Rid by you, but that I'm a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid your Horſe may prove unruly with my Mare. If that be all, Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> you may hold in your Mare; for our Horſe here is the Honeſteſt and Sobereſt Horſe in the World; he is not in the leaſt given to do any naughty thing on ſuch Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. Once upon a time indeed, he happen'd to forget himſelf, and go aſtray; but then he, and I, and my Maſter ru'd for't, with a Vengeance. I tell you again, Sir, you may ſafely ſtay if you pleaſe, for if your Mare were to be ſerv'd up to him in a Diſh, I'll lay my Life he would not ſo much as touch her. Upon this, the Traveller ſtopp'd his Mare, and did not a little gaze at the Figure and Countenance of our Knight, who rodo
<pb n="767" facs="tcp:54446:418"/>
without his Helmet, which, like a Wallet, hung at the Saddle-bow of <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Aſs. If the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in Green gaz'd on Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> Don <hi>Quixote</hi> look'd no leſs upon him, judging him to be ſome Man of Conſequence. His Age ſeem'd about fifty; he had ſome gray Hairs, a ſharp Look, and a grave, yet Pleaſing Aſpect. In ſhort, his Mein and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance ſpoke him a Man of Quality. When he look'd on Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> he thought he had never beheld before ſuch a ſtrange appearance of a Man: He could not but admire at the lankneſs of his Horſe; he conſider'd then the Long-back'd, Raw-bon'd Thing that beſtrid him: His wan, meager Face, his Air, his Gravity, his Arms and Equipage; ſuch a Figure, as perhaps had not been ſeen in that Country time out of Mind. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd how intent the travelling Gentleman had been in ſurveying him, and reading his Deſire in his Surprize, as he was the very Pink of Courteſie, and fond of pleaſing every one, without ſtaying till he ſhou'd queſtion him, he thought fit to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent him. Sir, ſaid he, that you are ſurpriz'd at this Figure of mine, which appears ſo new and exotick, I do not wonder in the leaſt; but your Admiration will ceaſe when I have inform'd you, that I am one of thoſe Knights who go in queſt of Adventures. I have left my Country, Mortgag'd my Eſtate, quitted my Pleaſures, and thrown my ſelf into the Arms of Fortune. My deſign was to give a new Life to Knight Errantry, that ſo long has been loſt to the World; and thus, after in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite toils and hardſhip; ſometimes ſtumbling, ſometimes falling; caſting my ſelf headlong in one place, and riſing again in another, I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd a great part of my Deſire, relieving Widows, protecting Damſels, aſſiſting Marry'd Women and Orphans, the proper and natural Office of Knight-Errants;

and ſo by many Valorous and Chriſtian-like Atchievements, I have merited the Honour of the Preſs in almoſt all the Nations of the World. Thirty thouſand Volumes of my Hiſtory have been printed already, and thirty thouſand Millions more are like to be printed, if Heaven prevent not. In ſhort, to ſumm up all in one Word, know, I am Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> otherwiſe call'd, The Knight of the woeful Figure; I own it leſſens the value of Praiſe to be the Publiſher of it one's ſelf; yet 'tis what I am ſometimes forc'd to, when there is none preſent to do me Juſtice. And now, good Sir, no longer let this Steed, this Lance, this Shield, this Armour, nor this Squire, nor the Paleneſs of my Looks, nor my exhauſted Body, move your Admiration, ſince you know who I am, and the Profeſſion I follow. Having ſaid thus, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was ſilent, and the Gentleman in Green, by his delaying to anſwer him, ſeem'd as if he did not intend to make any Return. But at laſt, after ſome pauſe; Sir Knight, ſaid he, you were ſenſible of my Curioſity by my Looks, and were pleas'd to ſay my Wonder wou'd ceaſe when you had inform'd me who you was; but I muſt confeſs, ſince you have done that, I remain no leſs ſurpriz'd and amaz'd than ever. For, is it poſſible there ſhou'd be at this time any Knight-Errants in the World, and there ſhou'd be a true Hiſtory of a living Knight-Errant in Print? I cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade my ſelf there is any body now upon Earth that relieves Widows, protects Damſels, or aſſiſts Married Women and Orphans; and I ſhou'd ſtill be of the ſame mind, had not my Eyes afforded me a ſight of ſuch a Perſon as your ſelf. Now Heaven be prais'd, for this Hiſtory of your true and noble Feats of Arms, which you ſay is in Print, will blot out the Memory of all thoſe Idle Romances
<pb n="769" facs="tcp:54446:419"/>
of pretended Knight-Errants that have ſo fill'd and peſter'd the World, to the detriment of good Education, and the Prejudice and Diſhonour of true Hiſtory. There is a great deal to be ſaid, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> for the Truth of Hiſtories of Knight-Errantry, as well as againſt it. How, return'd the Gentleman in Green! Is there any body living who makes the leaſt ſcruple but that they are falſe. Yes, Sir, my ſelf for one ſaid Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> But let that paſs: If we continue any time together on the Road, I hope to convince you that you have been to blame in ſuffering your ſelf to be carry'd away with the Stream of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind that generally disbelieves 'em. The Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller at this diſcourſe began to have a ſuſpicion that Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was diſtracted, and expected the next words would confirm him in that Opinion: But before they enter'd into any further Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> begg'd him to acquaint him who he was, ſince he had given him ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his own Life and Condition. Sir Knight of the Woeful Figure, anſwer'd the other, I am a Gentleman, born at a Village, where, God willing, we ſhall dine by and by. My Name is Don <hi>Diego de Miranda.</hi> I have a reaſonable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency. I paſs my time contentedly with my Wife, my Children and my Friends. My uſual Diverſions are Hunting and Fiſhing; yet I keep neither Hawks nor Hounds, but ſome tame Partridges and a Ferret. I have about three or fourſcore Books, ſome <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> ſome <hi>Latin;</hi> ſome of Hiſtory, and others of Divinity. But for Books of Knight-Errantry, none ever came within my Doors. I am more inclinable to read thoſe that are Profane than thoſe of Devotion, if they be ſuch as yield an innocent Amuſement, and are agreeable for their Style, and ſurprizing for their Invention,
<pb n="770" facs="tcp:54446:420"/>
tho' we have but few of 'em in our own Language. Sometimes I eat with my Neighbours and Friends, and often I invite 'em to do the like with me. My Treats are clean and handſome, neither penurious nor ſuperfluous. I am not given to murmur and backbite, nor do I love to hear others do it. I am no curious Inquirer into the Lives and Actions of other People. Every Day I hear Divine Service, and give to the Poor; without making a ſhew of it, or preſuming on my good deeds, leaſt I ſhou'd give way to Hypocriſie and Vain-glory, Enemies that too eaſily poſſeſs themſelves of the beſt guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hearts. I endeavour to reconcile thoſe that are at Variance. I pay my Devotions to the Bleſſed Virgin, and ever truſt in Heaven's infinite Mercy. <hi>Sancho</hi> liſten'd with great attention to this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Gentleman's way of Living; and believing that a Perſon who led ſo good and pious a Life, was able to work Miracles, he jump'd in haſte from his Aſs, and catching hold of his right Stirrup, with Tears in his Eyes and Devotion in his Heart, fell a kiſſing his Foot. What's the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Friend, cry'd the Gentleman, wondring at his proceeding? What's the meaning of this Kiſſing? Oh! good Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> Let me kiſs that dear Foot of yours, I beſeech you; for you are certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the firſt Saint on Horſe-back I ever ſaw in my born Days Alas! reply'd the Gentleman, I am no Saint, but a great Sinner: You indeed, Friend, I believe are a good Soul, as appears by your Simplicity. With that, <hi>Sancho</hi> return'd to his Pack-Saddle, having by this Action provok'd the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Gravity of his Maſter to ſmile, and caus'd new Admiration in Don <hi>Diego.</hi> And now Don <hi>Quixote</hi> enquires of him how many Children he had; telling him at the ſame time, that among the things in which the Ancient Philoſophers who had
<pb n="771" facs="tcp:54446:420"/>
not the true Knowledge of God, made Happineſs conſiſt, as the Advantages of Nature and Fortune, one was, to have many Friends and a numerous and Vertuous Off-ſpring. I have a Son, Sir Knight, anſwer'd the Gentleman; and perhaps if I had him not, I ſhou'd not think my ſelf the more unhappy; not that he is ſo bad neither, but becauſe he is not ſo good as I wou'd have him. He is Eighteen Years of Age; the laſt ſix he has ſpent at <hi>Salamanca,</hi> to perfect himſelf in his <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek.</hi> But, when I wou'd have had him to have proceeded to the Study of other Sciences, I found him ſo engag'd in that of Poetry, if it may be call'd a Science, that 'twas impoſſible to make him look either to the Study of the Law, which I intended him for, or of Divinity, the nobleſt Part of all Learning. I was in hopes he might have become an honour to his Family, living in an Age in which good and vertuous Literature is highly favour'd and rewarded by Princes; for Learning without Vertue, is like a Pearl upon a Dunghil. He now ſpends whole Days in examining whether <hi>Homer</hi> in ſuch a Verſe of his Iliads ſays well or no? Whether ſuch an Epigram in <hi>Martial</hi> ought not to be expung'd for Obſcenity? And whether ſuch and ſuch Verſes in <hi>Virgil</hi> are to be taken in ſuch a Senſe, or otherwiſe. In ſhort, his whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe is with the Celebrated Poets, with <hi>Horace</hi> and <hi>Perſius, Juvenal,</hi> and <hi>Tibullus.</hi> But as for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Rhimers, he has but an indifferent Opinion of 'm. And yet for all this Diſguſt of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Poetry, he is now breaking his Brain upon a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe or Gloſe on four Verſes that were ſent him from the Univerſity, and which I think are deſign'd for a Prize. Sir, reply'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> Children are the Fleſh and Blood of their Parents, and, whether good or bad, are to be cheriſh'd as part
<pb n="772" facs="tcp:54446:421"/>
of our ſelves. 'Tis the Duty of a Father to train 'em up from their tendereſt Years in the Paths of Vertue, in good Diſcipline and Chriſtian Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that when they advance in Years they may become the ſtaff and ſupport of their Parents Age, and the glory of their Poſterity. But as for forcing them to this or that Study, 'tis a thing I don't ſo well approve. Perſuaſion is all, I think, that is proper in ſuch a caſe. Eſpecially when they are ſo Fortunate as to be above ſtudying for Bread, as having Parents that can provide for their future Subſiſtence, they ought in my Opinion to be indulg'd in the purſuit of that Science to which their own Genius gives them the moſt Inclination. For tho' the Art of Poetry is not ſo profitable as delightful, yet it is none of thoſe that diſgrace the ingenious Profeſſor. Poetry, Sir, in my Judgment, is like a tender Virgin in her Bloom, Beautiful and Charming to Amazement: All the other Sciences are ſo many Virgins, whoſe Care it is to Enrich, Poliſh and Adorn her; and as ſhe is to make uſe of them all, ſo are they all to have from her a grateful acknowledgment. But this Virgin muſt not be roughly handl'd, nor dragg'd along the Streets, nor expos'd in every Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, and corner of Great Men's Houſes. A good Poet is a kind of an Alchymiſt, who can turn the Matter he prepares into the pureſt Gold and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable Treaſure. But he muſt keep his Muſe within the Rules of Decency, and not let her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute her Excellency in lewd Satires and Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poons, nor in licentious Sonnets. She muſt not be Mercenary, tho' ſhe need not give away the Profits ſhe may claim from Heroick Poems, deep Tragedies, and Pleaſant and Artful Comedies. She is not to be attempted by Buffoons, nor by the Ignorant Vulgar, whoſe Capacity can never reach
<pb n="773" facs="tcp:54446:421"/>
to a due Senſe of the Treaſures that are lock'd up in her. And know, Sir, that when I mention the Vulgar, I don't mean only the common Rabble; for whoever is ignorant, be he Lord or Prince, is to be liſted in the Number of the Vulgar. But whoever ſhall apply himſelf to the Muſes with thoſe Qualifications, which, as I ſaid, are Eſſential to the Character of a good Poet, his Name ſhall be Famous, and valu'd in all the poliſh'd Nations of the World. And as to what you ſay, Sir, that your Son does not much eſteem our Modern Poetry; in my Opinion, he is ſomewhat to blame; and my Reaſon is this: <hi>Homer</hi> never wrote in <hi>Latin,</hi> becauſe he was a <hi>Grecian;</hi> nor did <hi>Virgil</hi> write in <hi>Greek,</hi> becauſe <hi>Latin</hi> was the Language of his Country. In ſhort, all your Ancient Poets wrote in their Mother-Tongue, and did not ſeek other Languages to expreſs their lofty Thoughts. And thus, it wou'd be well that Cuſtom ſhou'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to every Nation; there being no Reaſon that a <hi>German</hi> Poet ſhou'd be deſpis'd becauſe he writes in his own Tongue; or a <hi>Caſtilian</hi> or <hi>Biſcayner,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they write in theirs. But, I ſuppoſe, your Son does not miſlike Modern Poetry, but ſuch Modern Poets as have no Tincture of any other Language or Science, that may adorn, awaken, and aſſiſt their Natural Impulſe. Tho' even in this too there may be Error. For, 'tis believ'd, and not without Reaſon, that a Poet is naturally a Poet from his Mother's Womb, and that, with the Talent which Heaven has infus'd into him, without the help of Study or Art, he may produce thoſe Compoſitions that verifie that Saying, <hi>Eſt Deus in nobis, &amp;c.</hi> Not but that a natural Poet that improves himſelf by Art, ſhall be much more accompliſh'd, and have the Advantage of him that has no Title to Poetry but by his Knowledge in
<pb n="774" facs="tcp:54446:422"/>
the Art; becauſe Art cannot go beyond Nature but only adds to its Perfection. From which it' appears, that the moſt perfect Poet is he whom Nature and Art combine to qualify. Let then your Son proceed and follow the Guidance of his Stars, for being ſo good a Student as I underſtand he is, and already got up the firſt ſtep of the Sciences, the knowledge of the Learned Tongues, he will eaſily aſcend to the Pinnacle of Learning, which is no leſs an Honour and an Ornament to a Gentleman than a Mitre is to a Biſhop, or the Long Robe to the Civilian. Shou'd your Son write Satires to leſſen the Reputation of any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, you wou'd do well to take him to Task, and tear his defamatory Rhimes; but if he Studies to write ſuch Diſcourſes in Verſe, to ridicule and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plode Vice in general, as <hi>Horace</hi> ſo Elegantly did, then encourage him: For a Poet's Pen is allow'd to inveigh againſt Envy and Envious Men, and ſo againſt other Vices, provided it aim not at par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons. But there are Poets ſo abandon'd to the Itch of Scurrility, that rather than loſe a villanous Jeſt, they'll venture being baniſh'd to the Iſland of <hi>Pontus.</hi> If a Poet is modeſt in his Manners, he will be ſo in his Verſes. The Pen is the Tongue of the Mind; the Thoughts that are form'd in the one, and thoſe that are trac'd by the other, will bear a near Reſemblance. And when Kings and Princes ſee the wonderful Art of Poetry ſhine in Prudent, Vertuous, and Solid Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, they honour, eſteem and enrich them, and even crown them with Leaves of that Tree, which is ne'er offended by the Thunderbolt, as a Token that nothing ſhall offend thoſe whoſe Brows are honour'd and adorn'd with ſuch Crowns. The Gentleman, hearing Don <hi>Quixote</hi> expreſs himſelf in this manner, was ſtruck with ſo much Admiration,
<pb n="775" facs="tcp:54446:422"/>
that he began to loſe the bad Opinion he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd of his Underſtanding. As for <hi>Sancho,</hi> who did not much reliſh this fine Talk, he took an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to ſlink aſide in the middle of it, and went to get a little Milk of ſome Shepherds that were hard by keeping their Sheep. Now when the Gentleman was going to renew his Diſcourſe, mightily pleas'd with theſe judicious Obſervations, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> lifting up his Eyes, perceiv'd a Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon on the Road, ſet round with little Flags, that appear'd to be the King's Colours; and believing it to be ſome new Adventure, he call'd out to <hi>Sancho</hi> to bring him his Helmet. <hi>Sancho,</hi> hearing him call aloud, left the Shepherds, and clapping his Heels vigorouſly to <hi>Dapple</hi>'s ſides, came trotting up to his Maſter, to whom there happen'd a moſt terrifying and deſperate Adventure.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Wherein you will find ſet forth the higheſt and utmoſt Proof that the great Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ever gave, or could give of his incredible Courage, with the ſucceſsful iſſue of the Adventure of the Lions.</head>
                        <p>THE Hiſtory relates that <hi>Sancho</hi> was chaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering with the Shepherds for ſome Curds, when Don <hi>Quixote</hi> call'd to him; and finding that his Maſter was in haſte, he did not know what to do with 'em, nor what to bring 'em in; yet loth to loſe his Purchaſe (for he had already paid
<pb n="776" facs="tcp:54446:423"/>
for 'em) he bethought himſelf at laſt of clapping 'em into the Helmet, where having 'em ſafe, he went to know his Maſter's Pleaſure. As ſoon as he came up to him, Give me that Helmet, Friend, ſaid the Knight, for if I underſtand any thing of Adventures, I deſcry one yonder that obliges me to Arm: The Gentleman in Green hearing this, look'd about him to ſee what was the Matter, but could perceive nothing but a Waggon, which made towards 'em, and by the little Flags about it he judg'd it to be one of the King's Carriages, and ſo he told Don <hi>Quixote.</hi> But his Head was too much poſſeſs'd with Notions of Adventures to give any Credit to what the Gentleman ſaid; Sir, anſwer'd he, <hi>Fore-warn'd, fore-arm'd,</hi> a Man loſes nothing by ſtanding on his Guard. I know by Experience, that I have Enemies viſible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, and I cannot tell when, nor where, nor in what Shapes they may attack me. At the ſame time he ſnatch'd the Helmet out of <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Hands, before he could diſcharge it of the Curds, and clapp'd it on his Head, without examining the Contents. Now the Curds being ſqueez'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his bare Crown and the Iron, the Whey began to run all about his Face and Beard; which ſo ſurpriz'd him, that calling to <hi>Sancho</hi> in great diſorder, What's this, cry'd he, <hi>Sancho!</hi> What's the matter with me! ſure my Scull is growing ſoft, or my Brains are melting, or elſe I ſweat from Head to Foot! But if I do, I'm ſure 'tis not for Fear. This certainly muſt be a very dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Adventure that's approaching. Give me ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to wipe me if thou canſt, for I'm almoſt blinded with the Torrent of Sweat. <hi>Sancho</hi> did not dare to ſay a Word, but giving him a Cloath, bleſs'd his Stars that his Maſter had not found him out. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> dry'd himſelf, and taking off
<pb n="777" facs="tcp:54446:423"/>
the Helmet to ſee what it ſhould be that felt ſo cold on his Head, perceiving ſome white ſtuff, and putting it to his Noſe, ſoon found what it was. Now, by the Life of my Lady <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo,</hi> cry'd he, thou haſt put Curds in my Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, vile Traytor and unmannerly Squire. Nay, reply'd <hi>Sancho</hi> cunningly, and keeping his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, if they be Curds, good your Worſhip give 'em me hither and I'll eat 'em: But hold, now I think on't, the Devil eat 'em for me; for he himſelf muſt have put 'em there. What! I offer to do ſo beaſtly a Trick! Do you think I have no more Manners? As ſure as I'm alive, Sir, I have got my Inchanters too that owe me a Grudge, and Plague me as a Limb of your Worſhip; and I warrant have put that naſty ſtuff there on purpoſe to ſet you againſt me, and make you fall foul on my Bones. But I hope they've miſs'd their aim this time, i'troth! My Maſter is a wiſe Man, and muſt needs know that I had neither Curds nor Milk, nor any thing of that kind; and if I had met with Curds, I ſhould ſooner have put 'em in my Belly than his Helmet. Well, ſaid Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote,</hi> there may be ſomething in that. The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had obſerv'd theſe Paſſages, and ſtood amaz'd, but eſpecially at what immediately follow'd; for the Knight-Errant having put on the Helmet again, fix'd himſelf well in the Stirrups, try'd whether his Sword were looſe enough in his Scab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard, and reſted his Lance. Now, cry'd he, come what will come; here am I who dare encounter the Devil himſelf in <hi>propria Perſona.</hi> By this time the Waggon was come up with them, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only by the Carter, mounted on one of the Mules, and another Man that ſat on the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of the Waggon. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> making up to 'em, Whither go ye, Friends, ſaid he? What
<pb n="778" facs="tcp:54446:424"/>
Waggon is this? What do ye convey in it? And what is the meaning of theſe Colours? The Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon is mine, anſwer'd the Waggoner: I have there two brave Lions, which the General of <hi>Oran</hi> is ſending to the King our Maſter, and theſe Colours are to let People underſtand that what goes here belongs to him. And are theſe Lions large, enquir'd Don <hi>Quixote?</hi> Very large, anſwer'd the Man in the fore-part of the Waggon: There never came bigger from <hi>Africk</hi> into <hi>Spain.</hi> I am their Keeper, added he, and have had charge of ſeveral others, but I never ſaw the like of theſe before. In the furthermoſt Cage is a He-lion, and in the other behind, a Lioneſs. By this time they are cruel hungry, for they have not eaten to Day; therefore pray, good Sir, ride out of the Way, for we muſt make haſte to get to the place where we intend to feed 'em. What! ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> with a ſcornful Smile, Lion-Whelps againſt me! Againſt me thoſe puny Beaſts! And at this time of Day! Well, I'll make thoſe Gentlemen that ſent their Lions this way, know whether I am a Man to be ſcar'd with Lions: Get off honeſt Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and ſince you are the Keeper, open their Cages, and let 'em both out; for maugre and in deſpight of thoſe Inchanters that have ſent 'em to try me, I'll make the Creatures know in the midſt of this very Field, who Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha</hi> is. So, thought the Gentleman to himſelf, now has our poor Knight diſcover'd what he is; the Curds, I find, have ſoften'd his Scull, and mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd his Brains. While he was making this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, <hi>Sancho</hi> came up to him, and begg'd him to diſſwade his Maſter from his raſh Attempt. Oh good dear Sir! cry'd he, for Pity-ſake hinder my Maſter from falling upon theſe Lions, by all means, or we ſhall be torn a-pieces. Why, ſaid
<pb n="779" facs="tcp:54446:424"/>
the Gentleman, is your Maſter ſo arrant a Mad-man then, that you ſhould fear he would ſet upon ſuch furious Beaſts. Ah Sir! ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> he is not mad, but woundy venterſome. Well, reply'd the Gentleman, I'll take care there ſhall be no harm done; and with that advancing up to Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> who was urging the Lion-keeper to open the Cage; Sir, ſaid he, Knight-Errants ought to engage in Adventures, from which there may be ſome hopes of coming off with Safety; but not in ſuch as are altogether Deſperate; for that Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage which borders on Temerity, is more like Madneſs than true Fortitude. Beſides, theſe Lions are not come againſt you, but ſent as a Preſent to the King, and therefore 'tis not the beſt way to detain 'em, or ſtop the Waggon. Pray, ſweet Sir, reply'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> go and amuſe your ſelf with your tame Partridges and your Ferrets, and leave every one to his own Buſineſs. This is mine, and I know beſt whether theſe worthy Lions are ſent againſt me or no. Then turning about to the Keeper, Sirrah! you Raſcal you, ſaid he, either open the Cages immediately, or by Heav'n I'll pin thee to the Waggon with this Lance. Good Sir, (cry'd the Waggoner, ſeeing this ſtrange Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition in Armour ſo Reſolute) for Mercy's ſake do but let me take out our Mules firſt, and get out of harm's-way with 'em as faſt as I can, before the Lions get out; for if they ſhould once ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the poor Beaſts, I ſhould be undone for ever; for alas! that Cart and they are all I have in the World to get a living with. Incredulous Wretch, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> take 'em out quickly then, and go with 'em where thou wilt; though thou ſhalt preſently ſee that thy Pre-caution was needleſs, and thou might'ſt have ſpar'd thy Pains. The Waggoner upon this made all the haſte he could
<pb n="780" facs="tcp:54446:425"/>
to take out his Mules, while the Keeper cry'd out as loud as he was able, Bear Witneſs, all ye that are here preſent, that 'tis againſt my Will I'm forc'd to open the Cages and let looſe the Lions, and that I proteſt to this Gentleman here, that he ſhall be anſwerable for all the Mischief and Damage they may do; together with the loſs of my Salary and Fees. And now, Sirs, ſhift for your ſelves as faſt as you can, before I open the Cages: For, as for my ſelf, I know the Lions will do me no harm. Once more the Gentleman try'd to diſſwade Don <hi>Quixote</hi> from doing ſo mad a thing; telling him, that he tempted Heaven, in expoſing himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reaſon to ſo great a Danger. To this Don <hi>Quixote</hi> made no other anſwer, but that he knew what he had to do. Conſider however what you do, reply'd the Gentleman, for 'tis moſt certain that you are very much miſtaken. Well, Sir, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote</hi> if you care not to be Spectator of an Action, which you think is like to be Tragical, e'en ſet Spurs to your Mare, and provide for your Safety. <hi>Sancho</hi> hearing this, came up to his Maſter with Tears in his Eyes, and begg'd him not to go about this fearful Undertaking, to which the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture of the Wind-mills, and the Fulling-mills, and all the Brunts he had ever born in his Life, were but Childrens Play. Good your Worſhip, cry'd he, do but mind, here'e no Inchantment in the Caſe, nor any thing like it. A lack a-day! Sir, I peep'd e'en now through the Grates of the Cage, and I'm ſure I ſaw the Claw of a true Lion, and ſuch a Claw as makes me think the Lion that owns it muſt be as big as a Mountain. Alas poor Fellow! ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> thy Fear will make him as big as half the World. Retire, <hi>Sancho,</hi> and leave me, and if I chance to fall here, thou know'ſt our old Agreement; repair to <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> I ſay no
<pb n="781" facs="tcp:54446:425"/>
more. To this he added ſome Expreſſions, which cut off all Hopes of his giving over his mad De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. The Gentleman in the Green would have oppos'd him, but conſidering the other was much better Arm'd, and that it was not Prudence to encounter a Mad-man, he even took the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity while Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was ſtorming at the Keeper, to march off with his Mare, as <hi>Sancho</hi> did with <hi>Dapple,</hi> and the Carter with his Mules, every one making the beſt of their way to get as far as they could from the Waggon before the Lions were let looſe. Poor <hi>Sancho</hi> at the ſame time made ſad Lamentations for his Maſter's Death; for he gave him for loſt, not queſtioning but the Lions had already got him into their Clutches. He curs'd his ill-fortune and the hour he came again to his Service; but for all his Wailing and Lamenting, he punch'd on poor <hi>Dapple,</hi> to get as far as he could from the Lions. The Keeper perceiving the Perſons who fled to be at a good diſtance, fell to arguing and entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Don <hi>Quixote</hi> as he had done before. But the Knight told him again, that all his Reaſons and Entreaties were but in vain, and bid him ſay no more, but immediately diſpatch. Now while the Keeper took time to open the foremoſt Cage, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ſtood debating with himſelf, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had beſt make his attack on Foot or on Horſe-back, and upon mature Deliberation, he reſolv'd to do it on Foot, leſt <hi>Rozinante,</hi> not us'd to Lions, ſhould be put into diſorder. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he quitted his Horſe, threw aſide his Lance, graſp'd his Shield, and drew his Sword; then advancing with a deliberate Motion, and an undaunted Heart, he poſted himſelf juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the door of the Cage, commending himſelf to Heaven, and afterwards to his Lady <hi>Dulcinea.</hi>

Here the Author of this faithful Hiſtory could not forbear breaking the Thread of his Narration, and rais'd by Wonder to a Rapture and Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm, makes the following Exclamation. Oh thou moſt magnanimous Heroe! Brave and unutterably Bold Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha.</hi> Thou Mirrour and grand Exemplar of Valour. Thou ſecond, and thou new Don <hi>Manuel de Leon,</hi> the late Glory and Honour of all <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cavaliers! What Words, what Colours ſhall I uſe to expreſs, to paint in equal Lines this aſtoniſhing Deed of thine! What Language ſhall I employ to convince Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Truth of this thy more than Humane Enterprize! What Praiſes can be Coin'd, what Elogies invented, that will not be out-vy'd by thy ſuperiour Merit, tho' Hyperboles were pil'd on Hyperboles! Thou alone on Foot, Intrepid and Magnanimous, with nothing but a Sword, and that none of the ſharpeſt, with thy ſingle Shield, and that none of the brighteſt, ſtood'ſt ready to receive and encounter the Savage force of two vaſt Lions, as fierce as ever roar'd within the <hi>Lybian</hi> Deſarts. Then let thy own unrivall'd Deeds, that beſt can ſpeak thy Praiſe, amaze the World, and fill the mouth of Fame, brave Champion of <hi>la Mancha:</hi> while I'm oblig'd to leave off the high Theme, for want of vigour to maintain the Flight. Here ended the Author's Exclamation, and the Hiſtory goes on.</p>
                        <p>The Keeper obſerving the Poſture Don <hi>Quixote</hi> had put himſelf in, and that it was not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him to prevent letting out the Lions, without incurring the Reſentment of the deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Knight; ſet the Door of the foremoſt Cage wide open, where, as I have ſaid, that Lion lay, who then appear'd of a Monſtrous Bigneſs, and of a hideous frightful Aſpect. The firſt thing

he did was to roll and turn himſelf round in his Cage; in the next place he ſtretch'd out one of his Paws, put forth his Claws, and rouz'd himſelf. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he gap'd and yawn'd for a good while, and ſhew'd his dreadful Fangs, and then thruſt out half a Yard of broad Tongue, and with it lick'd the Duſt out of his Eyes and Face. Having done this he thruſt his Head quite out of the Cage, and ſtar'd about with his Eyes that look'd like two live Coals of Fire; a Sight and Motion, enough to have ſtruck Terror into Temerity it ſelf. But Don <hi>Quixote</hi> only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded it with Attention, wiſhing his grim Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary would leap out of his Hold, and come within his reach, that he might exerciſe his Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and cut the Monſter Piece-meal. To this height of Extravagance had his Folly tranſported him; but the generous Lion, more Gentle than Arrogant, taking no notice of his Vapouring and Bravadoes, after he had look'd about him a while, turn'd his Tail, and having ſhew'd Don <hi>Quixote</hi> his Poſteriors, very contentedly lay down again in his Apartment. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ſeeing this, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Keeper to roufe him with his Pole, and force him out whether he would or no. Not I, indeed Sir, anſwer'd the Keeper; I dare not do it for my Life; for if I provoke him, I'm ſure to be the firſt he'll tear to Pieces. Let me adviſe you, Sir, to be ſatisfy'd with what you have done. 'Tis as much as the braveſt He that wears a Head ought to do. Then pray go no further, I beſeech you. The Door ſtands open, the Lion is at his Choice, whether he will come out or no. You have wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for him; you ſee he does not care to look you in the Face, and ſince he did not come out at the firſt, I dare engage he will not ſtir out this Day. You have ſhewn enough the Greatneſs of your Courage. No Man is oblig'd to do more than
<pb n="784" facs="tcp:54446:428"/>
Challenge his Enemy, and wait for him in the Field. If he comes not that's his own Fault, and the Scandal is his, as the Honour the Challenger's. 'Tis true, reply'd Don <hi>Quixote.</hi> Come, ſhut the Cage-Door, Honeſt Friend, and give me a Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate under thy Hand in the ampleſt Form thou canſt deviſe, of what thou haſt ſeen me perform; how thou didſt open the Cage for the Lion; how I expected his coming, and he did not come out. How, upon his not coming out then, I ſtay'd his own Time, and inſtead of meeting me, he turn'd Tail and lay down. I am oblig'd to do no more. So, Inchantments avaunt! and Heaven proſper Truth, Juſtice, and Knight-Errantry! ſhut the Door, as I bid thee, while I make Signs to thoſe that ran away from us, and get 'em to come back, that they may have an Account of this Exploit from thy own Mouth. The Keeper obey'd, and Don <hi>Quixote</hi> clapping on the Point of his Lance the Handkerchief, with which he had wip'd off the Curds from his Face, wav'd it in the Air, and call'd as loud as he was able to the Fugitives, who fled nevertheleſs, looking behind 'em all the way, and troop'd on in a Body with the Gentleman in Green at the Head of 'em. At laſt <hi>Sancho</hi> obſerv'd the Signal of the white Flag, and calling out to the reſt; Hold, cry'd he, my Maſter calls to us, I'll be hang'd if he has not got the better of the Lions. At this they all fac'd about, and perceiv'd Don <hi>Quixote</hi> flouriſhing his Enſign; whereupon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering a little from their Fright, they leiſurely rode back, till they could plainly diſtinguiſh Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Voice; and then they came up to the Waggon. As ſoon as they were got near it, come on Friend, ſaid he to the Carter, put thy Mules into the Waggon again, and purſue thy Journey; and <hi>Sancho</hi> do thou give him two Ducats for the
<pb n="785" facs="tcp:54446:428"/>
Lion-keeper and himſelf, to make them amends for the Time I have detain'd them. Ay, that I will with all my Heart, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but what's become of the Lions? Are they dead or alive? Then the Keeper very formally related the whole Action, not failing to exaggerate, to the beſt of his Skill, Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Courage; how at his Sight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, the Lion was ſo terrify'd, that he neither would nor durſt quit his ſtrong Hold, tho' for that end his Cage-door was kept open for a conſiderable Time; and how at length upon his remonſtrating to the Knight, who wou'd have had the Lion forc'd out, that it was preſuming too much upon Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, he had permitted, tho' with great Reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that the Lion ſhou'd be ſhut up again. Well, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> to his Squire, what doſt thou think of this? Can Inchantment prevail over true Fortitude? No, theſe Magicians may perhaps rob me of Succeſs, but never of my invincible Greatneſs of Mind. In ſhort, <hi>Sancho</hi> gave the Waggoner and the Keeper the two Pieces. The firſt harneſs'd his Mules, and the laſt thank'd Don <hi>Quixote</hi> for his Noble Bounty, and promis'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the King himſelf with this Heroick Action when he came to Court. Well, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> if his Majeſty ſhou'd chance to enquire who the Perſon was that did this thing, tell him 'twas <hi>The Knight of the Lions;</hi> a Name I intend henceforth to take up, in lieu of that which I hitherto aſſum'd, of <hi>the Knight of the woful Figure;</hi> in which proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I do but conform to the ancient Cuſtom of Knights-Errant, who chang'd their Names as often as they pleas'd, or as it ſuited with their Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. After this, the Waggon made the beſt of its way, as Don <hi>Quixote, Sancho</hi> and the Gentleman in Green did of theirs. The latter for a great while was ſo taken up with making his Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="786" facs="tcp:54446:429"/>
upon Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> that he had not Time to ſpeak a Syllable; not knowing what Opinion to have of a Perſon, in whom he diſcover'd ſuch a Mixture of good Senſe and Extravagance. He was a Stranger to the firſt Part of his Hiſtory; for, had he read it, he cou'd not have wonder'd either at his Words or Actions: But not knowing the Nature of his Madneſs, he took him to be wiſe and diſtracted by Fits; ſince in his Diſcourſe he ſtill expreſs'd himſelf juſtly and handſomely enough; but in his Actions all was Wild, Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and Unaccountable. For, ſaid the Gentleman to himſelf, can there be any thing more fooliſh than for this Man to put on his Helmet full of Curds, and then believe 'em convey'd there by Inchanters; or any thing more extravagant than forcibly to endeavour to Fight with Lions? In the midſt of this Soliloquy, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> interrupted him. Without doubt, Sir, ſaid he, you take me for a downright Madman, and indeed my Actions may ſeem to ſpeak me no leſs. But for all that, give me leave to tell you, I am not ſo mad, nor is my Underſtanding ſo defective, as I ſuppoſe you may fancy. What a Noble Figure does the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Knight make, who in the midſt of ſome ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Place transfixes a furious Bull with his Lance in the View of his Prince! What a Noble Figure makes the Knight, who before the Ladies at a harmleſs Tournament, comes prancing thro' the Liſts enclos'd in ſhining Steel; or thoſe Court Champions, who in Exerciſes of Martial kind, or that at leaſt are ſuch in Appearance, ſhew their Activity; and tho' all they do is nothing but for Recreation, are thought the Ornament of a Prince's Court! But a much Nobler Figure is the Knight-Errant, who, fir'd with the Thirſt of a glorious Fame, wanders thro' Deſarts, thro' ſolitary Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſes,
<pb n="787" facs="tcp:54446:429"/>
thro' Woods, thro' Croſs-ways, over Mountains and Valleys, in queſt of perillous Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, reſolv'd to bring them to a happy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. Yes, I ſay, a Nobler Figure is a Knight-Errant ſuccouring a Widow in ſome depopulated Place, than the Court-Knight making his Addreſſes to the City-Dames. Every Knight has his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Employment. Let the Courtier wait on the Ladies, let him with ſplendid Equipage adorn his Prince's Court, and with a magnificent Table ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his poor Companions. Let him give Birth to Feaſts and Tournaments, and ſhew his Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, Liberality and Munificence, and eſpecially his Piety; in all theſe things he fulfils the Duties of his Station. But as for the Knight-Errant, let him ſearch into all the Corners of the World, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the moſt intricate Labyrinths, and every Hour be ready to attempt Impoſſibility it ſelf. Let him in deſolate Wilds baffle the Rigour of the Weather, the Scorching Heat of the Sun's fierceſt Beams, and the Inclemency of Winds and Snow; Let Lions never fright him, Dragons daunt him, nor Evil Spirits deterr him. To go in queſt of theſe, to meet, to dare, to conflict, and to overcome 'em all, is his principal and proper Office. Since then my Stars have decreed me to be one of thoſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturous Knights, I think my ſelf oblig'd to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt every thing that ſeems to come within the Verge of my Profeſſion. This, Sir, engag'd me to Encounter thoſe Lions juſt now, judging it to be my immediate Buſineſs, though I was ſenſible of the extreme Raſhneſs of the Undertaking. For well I know, that Valour is a Vertue ſituate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Vicious Extremes of Cowardiſe and Temerity. But certainly 'tis not ſo ill for a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Man to riſe to a Degree of Raſhneſs, as 'tis to fall ſhort and border upon Cowardiſe. As 'tis
<pb n="788" facs="tcp:54446:430"/>
eaſier for a Prodigal to become Liberal, than a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer; ſo 'tis eaſier for the hardy and raſh Perſon to be reduc'd to true Bravery, than for the Coward ever riſe to that Vertue: And therefore in thus at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting Adventures, believe me, Signior Don <hi>Diego,</hi> 'tis better to exceed the Bounds a little, and over-do, rather than under-do the thing; becauſe it ſounds better in People's Ears to hear it ſaid, how that ſuch a Knight is Raſh and Hardy, than ſuch a Knight is Daſtardly and Timorous. For my part, Sir, anſwer'd Don <hi>Diego,</hi> I think all you have ſaid and done is agreeable to the exacteſt Rules of Reaſon; and I believe if the Laws and Ordinances of Knight-Errantry were loſt, they might be all recover'd from you, your Breaſt ſeeming to be the ſafe Repoſitory and Archive where they lodg'd. But it grows late; let us make a little more haſte to get to our Village, and to my Habitation, where you may reſt your ſelf after the Fatigues, which doubtleſs you have ſuſtain'd, if not in Body, at leaſt in Mind, whoſe Pains often afflict the Body too. Sir, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> I eſteem your Offer as a ſingular Favour; and ſo putting on a little faſter than they had done before, about two in the Afternoon they reach'd the Village, and got to the Houſe of Don <hi>Diego,</hi> whom now Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote</hi> call'd the Knight of the <hi>Green Coat.</hi>

                        <p>DON <hi>Quixote</hi> found, that Don <hi>Diego de Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randa</hi>'s Houſe was ſpacious after the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try manner, the Arms of the Family were over the Gate in rough Stone, the Buttery in the Fore-yard, the Cellar under the Porch, and all around ſeveral great Jars of that ſort commonly made at <hi>Toboſo;</hi> the Sight of which bringing to his Remembrance his Inchanted and Transform'd <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> he heav'd a deep Sigh, and neither minding what he ſaid, nor who was by, broke out into the following Exclamation.</p>

                           <l>

                                 <hi>O dulces prendas,</hi> the Beginning of a Sonnet in the <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>Montemayor.</hi>
                              </note> Oh! Pledges, once my Comfort and Relief,</l>
                           <l>Though Pleaſing ſtill, diſcover'd now with Grief.</l>
                        </q>
                        <p>Oh ye <hi>Toboſian</hi> Urns, that awaken in my Mind the Thoughts of the ſweet Pledge of my moſt bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sorrows! Don <hi>Diego</hi>'s Son, who, as it has been ſaid, was a Student, and Poetically inclin'd, heard theſe Words as he came with his Mother to wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him home; and, as well as ſhe, was not a little ſurpriz'd to ſee what a ſtrange Creature his
<pb n="790" facs="tcp:54446:431"/>
Father had brought with him. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> alight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and very courteouſly deſiring to Kiſs her Ladyſhip's Hands: Madam, ſaid Don <hi>Diego,</hi> this Gentleman is the Noble Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> the Wiſeſt, and moſt Valiant Knight-Errant in the World; pray let him find a Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſuitable to his Merit, and your uſual Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Thereupon Donna <hi>Chriſtina</hi> (for this was the Lady's Name) receiv'd him very kindly, and with great Marks of Reſpect; to which Don <hi>Quixote</hi> made a proper and handſome Return, and then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the ſame Compliments paſs'd between him and the young Gentleman, whom Don <hi>Quixote</hi> judg'd by his Diſcourſe to be a Man of Wit and Senſe.</p>
                        <p>Here the Author inſerts a long Deſcription of every Particular in Don <hi>Diego</hi>'s Houſe, giving us an Inventory of all the Goods and Chattels, and every Circumſtance peculiar to the Houſe of a Rich Country Gentleman: But the Tranſlator preſum'd that it wou'd be better to omit theſe little things, and ſuch like inſignificant Matters, being foreign to the main Subject of this Hiſtory, which ought to be more grounded on material Truth, than cold and inſipid Digreſſions.</p>
                        <p>Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was brought into a fair Room, where <hi>Sancho</hi> took off his Armour, and then the Knight appear'd in a pair of cloſe Breeches, and a Doublet of Shamoy-Leather, all beſmear'd with the Ruſt of his Armour. About his Neck he wore a plain Band, unſtarch'd, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a Student; about his Legs ſad-colour'd Spatter-daſhes, and on his Feet a pair of Wax-leather Shooes. He hung his truſty Sword by his Side in a Belt of Sea-Wolf's Skin; which makes many of Opinion he had been long troubl'd with a
<pb n="791" facs="tcp:54446:431"/>
Pain in the Kidneys. Over all this he clapp'd on a long Cloak of good Ruſſet-Cloth: But firſt of all he waſh'd his Head and Face in five Kettle-fuls of Water, if not in ſix, for as to the exact Number there is ſome Diſpute. And 'tis obſervable, that the Water ſtill retain'd a Tincture of Whey: Thanks to <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Gluttony, that had made him clap into his Maſter's Helmet thoſe diſmal Curds, that ſo contaminated his awful Head and Face. In this Dreſs the Knight with a graceful and ſprightly Air, walk'd into another Room, where Don <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo,</hi> the young Gentleman whom we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mention'd, waited his coming, to keep him Company till the Cloth was laid; the Miſtreſs of the Houſe being gone in the mean time to provide a handſome Entertainment, that might convince her Gueſt ſhe underſtood how to make thoſe wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come that came to her Houſe. But before the Knight was ready, Don <hi>Lorenzo</hi> had Leiſure to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe his Father about him. Pray, Sir, ſaid he, who is this Gentleman you have brought with you? Conſidering his Name, his Aſpect, and the Title of Knight-Errant, which you give him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my Mother nor I can tell what to think of him. Truly, Son, anſwer'd Don <hi>Diego,</hi> I don't know what to ſay to you; all that I can inform you of, is, that I have ſeen him do the greateſt Follies in the World, and yet ſay a thouſand ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things that contradict his Actions. But diſcourſe him your ſelf, and feel the Pulſe of his Underſtanding; make uſe of your Senſe to judge of his; though to tell you the Truth, I believe his Folly exceeds his Diſcretion. Don <hi>Lorenzo</hi> then went to entertain Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and after ſome Diſcourſe had paſs'd between 'em. Sir, ſaid the Knight, I am not wholly a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to your Merit; Don <hi>Diego de Miranda</hi> your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="792" facs="tcp:54446:432"/>
has given me to underſtand you are a Perſon of excellent Parts, and eſpecially a great Poet. Sir, anſwer'd the young Gentleman, I may perhaps pretend to Poetry, but never to be a great Poet: 'Tis true I am ſomewhat given to Rhiming, and love to read good Authors; but I am very far from deſerving to be thought one of their Number. I do not miſlike your Modeſty, reply'd Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> 'tis a Virtue not often found among Poets, for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them commonly thinks himſelf the greateſt in the World. There is no Rule without an Exception, ſaid Don <hi>Lorenzo;</hi> and 'tis not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but there may be one who may deſerve the Name, tho' he does not think ſo himſelf. That's very unlikely, reply'd Don <hi>Quixote.</hi> But pray, Sir, tell me what Verſes are thoſe that your Father ſays you are ſo puzzl'd about? If it ſhou'd be what we call a Gloſs or a Paraphraſe, I underſtand ſomething of that Way of Writing, and ſhou'd be glad to ſee it. If the Compoſition be deſign'd for a Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Prize, I would adviſe you only to put in for the ſecond; for the firſt always goes by Favour, and is rather granted to the great Quality of the Author than to his Merit; but as to the next, 'tis adjudg'd to the moſt deſerving; ſo that the third may in a Manner be eſteem'd the ſecond, and the firſt no more than the third, according to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod us'd in our Univerſities: And yet, after all, 'tis no ſmall Matter to gain the Honour of being call'd the firſt. Hitherto all's well, thought Don <hi>Lorenzo</hi> to himſelf, I can't think thee mad yet; let's go on — With that addreſſing himſelf to Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> Sir, ſaid he, you ſeem to me to have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented the Schools, pray what Science has been your particular Study? That of Knight-Errantry, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> which is as good as that of Poetry, and ſomewhat better too. I don't know
<pb n="793" facs="tcp:54446:432"/>
what ſort of Science that is, ſaid Don <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> nor indeed did I ever hear of it before. 'Tis a Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> that includes in it ſelf all the other Sciences in the World, or at leaſt the greateſt Part of them: Whoever profeſſes it ought to be learned in the Laws, and underſtand diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butive and commutative Juſtice, in order to right all Mankind. He ought to be a Divine, to give a Reaſon of his Faith, and vindicate his Religion by Dint of Argument. He ought to be skill'd in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, eſpecially in the botanick Part of it, that he may know the Nature of Simples, and have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to thoſe Herbs that can cure Wounds; for a Knight-Errant muſt not expect to find Surgeons in the Woods and Deſarts. He muſt be an Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomer, to underſtand the Motions of the Celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Orbs, and find out by the Stars the Hour of the Night, and the Longitude and Latitude of the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate on which Fortune throws him; and he ought to be as well inſtructed in all the other Parts of the Mathematicks, that Science being of conſtant uſe to a Profeſſor of Arms on many Accounts too nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous to be related. I need not tell you that all the divine and moral Virtues muſt center in his Mind. To deſcend to leſs material Qualifications; he muſt be able to ſwim like a Fiſh, ſhooe a Horſe, mend a Saddle or a Harneſs: And returning to high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Matters, he ought to be inviolably devoted to Heaven and his Miſtreſs, Chaſte in his Thoughts, Modeſt in Words, and Liberal and Valiant in Deeds; Patient in Afflictions, Charitable to the Poor, and finally, a Maintainer of Truth, though it coſt him his Life to defend it. Theſe are the Endowments that conſtitute a good Knight-Errant; and now, Sir, be you a Judge, whether the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Chivalry have an eaſy Task to perform, and whether ſuch a Science may not ſtand in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
<pb n="794" facs="tcp:54446:433"/>
with the moſt Celebrated and beſt of thoſe that are taught in Colleges? If it be ſo, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd Don <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> I ſay it deſerves the Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence over all other Sciences. What do you mean, Sir, by that, <hi>If it be ſo,</hi> cry'd Don <hi>Quixote?</hi> I mean, Sir, reply'd Don <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> that I doubt whether there are now, or ever were, any Knights-Errant, eſpecially with ſo many rare Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. This makes good what I have often ſaid, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote:</hi> moſt People will not be perſwaded there ever were any Knights-Errant in the World. Now, Sir, becauſe I verily believe, that unleſs Heaven will work ſome Miracle to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them that there have been, and ſtill are Knights-Errant, thoſe incredulous Perſons are too much Wedded to their Opinion to admit ſuch a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; I will not now loſe Time to endeavour to let you ſee how much you and they are miſtaken; all I deſign to do, is only to beſeech Heaven to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you of your being in an Error, that you may ſee how uſeful Knights-Errant were in former Ages, and the vaſt Advantages that would reſult in ours from the Aſſiſtance of Men of that Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But now Effeminacy, Sloth, Luxury and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble Pleaſures, triumph for the Puniſhment of our Sins. Now, ſaid Don <hi>Lorenzo</hi> to himſelf, our Gentleman has already betray'd his Blind-ſide; but yet he gives a Colour of Reaſon to his Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, and I were a Fool ſhould I think otherwiſe. Here they were call'd to Dinner, which ended their Diſcourſe: And at that time Don <hi>Diego</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Son aſide, ask'd him what he thought of the Stranger? I think, Sir, ſaid Don <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> that 'tis not in the Power of all the Phyſicians in the World to Cure his Diſtemper. He is Mad paſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, but yet he has pleaſant lucid Intervals. In ſhort, they Din'd, and their Entertainment prov'd

ſuch as the old Gentleman had told the Knight he us'd to give his Gueſts, neat, plentiful, and well order'd. But that which Don <hi>Quixote</hi> moſt admir'd, was, the extraordinary Silence he obſerv'd through the whole Houſe, as if it had been a Monaſtery of mute <hi>Carthuſians.</hi> The Cloth being remov'd, Grace ſaid, and Hands waſh'd, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſir'd Don <hi>Lorenzo</hi> to ſhew him the Verſes he had wrote for the Poetical Prize. Well, Sir, anſwer'd he, becauſe I will not be like thoſe Poets that are unwilling to ſhew their Verſes when en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to do it, but will tire you with them when no body deſires it; I'll ſhew you my Gloſs or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe, which I did not Write with a Deſign to get a Prize, but only to exerciſe my Muſe. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> a Friend of mine, a Man of good Senſe, once told me, he wou'd not adviſe any one to break his Brains about that ſort of Compoſition; and he gave me this Reaſon for't, that the Gloſs or Comment cou'd never exactly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the Theme; ſo far from it that moſt commonly it left it altogether, and ran contrary to the Thought of the Author of the Text. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, he ſaid, that the Rules to which Cuſtom ties up the Compoſers of thoſe elaborate Amuſements are too ſtrict, allowing no Interrogations, no ſuch Interjection as <hi>ſaid he,</hi> or <hi>ſhall I ſay;</hi> no changing of Nouns into Verbs; nor any altering of the Senſe: Beſides ſeveral other Confinements that cramp up thoſe who puzzle their Brains with ſuch a crabbed way of Gloſſing, as you your ſelf, Sir, without doubt muſt know. Really, Signior Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> I wou'd fain catch you Tripping, but you ſtill ſlip from me like an Eel. I don't know, Sir, reply'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> what you mean by your <hi>ſlipping?</hi> I'll tell you another Time, anſwer'd the young Gentleman; in the mean

<pb n="800" facs="tcp:54446:436"/>
whether I have already ſaid it to you, but if I have, give me leave to repeat it once more, that if you are Ambitious of climbing up to the difficult, and in a manner, inacceſſible ſummit of the Temple of Fame, your ſureſt way is to leave on one hand the narrow Path of Poetry, and follow the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower Tack of Knight-Errantry, which in a trice may raiſe you to an Imperial Throne. With theſe Words, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ſeem'd to have Summ'd up the whole Evidence of his Madneſs. However, he cou'd not conclude without adding ſomething more. Heaven knows, ſaid he, how willingly I would take Don <hi>Lorenzo</hi> with me, to inſtruct him in thoſe Vertues that are annex'd to the Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I profeſs, to ſpare the humble and cruſh the Proud and Haughty. But ſince his tender Years do not yet qualifie him for the Hardſhips of that Life, and his Laudable Exerciſes detain him; I muſt reſt Contented with letting you know, That one way to acquire Fame in Poetry, is, to be govern'd by other Mens Judgment more than your own: For 'tis natural to Fathers and Mothers not to think their own Children ugly; and this Error is no where ſo common as in the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of the Mind. Don <hi>Diego</hi> and his Son were again ſurpriz'd to hear this Medley of good Senſe and Extravagance, and to find the poor Gentleman ſo ſtrongly bent on the queſt of his unlucky Adventures, the only Aim and Object of his Deſires. After this, and many Compliments, and mutual Reiterations of Offers of Service; Don <hi>Quixote</hi> having taken leave of the Lady of the Caſtle, he on <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> on <hi>Dapple,</hi> ſet out, and purſu'd their Journey.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> The Adventure of the Amorous Shepherd, and other truly comical Paſſages.</head>
                        <p>DON <hi>Quixote</hi> had not Travell'd far, when he was overtaken by two Men that look'd like Students or Eccleſiaſticks, with two Farmers, all mounted upon Aſſes. One of the Scholars had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him a ſmall bundle of Linnen, and two pair of Stockings, truſs'd up in green Buckram like a Portmanteau; t'other had no other Luggage but a couple of Foils and a pair of Fencing-Pumps. And the Husbandmen had a parcel of other things, which ſhew'd that having made their Market at ſome adjacent Town, they were now returning home with their Ware. They all admir'd (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all others did that ever beheld him) what kind of Fellow Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was, ſeeing him make a Figure ſo very different from any thing they had ever ſeen. The Knight ſaluted them, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving their Road lay the ſame way, offer'd them his Company, entreating them however to move an eaſier Pace, becauſe their Aſſes went faſter than his Horſe; and to engage them the more, he gave them a hint of his Circumſtances and Profeſſion; that he was a Knight-Errant, travelling round the World in queſt of Adventures, that his proper Name was Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha;</hi> but his Titular Denomination, <hi>The Knight of the Lions.</hi> All this was <hi>Greek,</hi> or Pedlar's <hi>French</hi> to the Country-men; but the Students preſently found out his
<pb n="802" facs="tcp:54446:437"/>
Blind-ſide. However, with a reſpectful diſtance, Sir Knight, ſaid one of them, if you are not fix'd to any ſet Stage, as Perſons of your Function ſeldom are, let us beg the Honour of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and you ſhall be entertain'd with one of the fineſt and moſt ſumptuous Weddings that ever was ſeen, either in <hi>la Mancha,</hi> or many Leagues round it. The Nuptials of ſome young Prince, I preſume, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote?</hi> No, Sir, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd the other, but of a Yeoman's Son, and a Neighbour's Daughter, he the richeſt in all this Country, and ſhe the handſomeſt you ever ſaw. The Entertainment at the Wedding will be New and Extraordinary, 'tis to be kept in a Meadow near the Village where the Bride lives. They call her <hi>Quiteria the Handſome</hi> by reaſon of her Beauty, and the Bridegroom no leſs deſervedly <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macho the Rich.</hi> They are well Match'd as to Age, for ſhe draws towards Eighteen, and he is about Two and Twenty, though ſome nice Folks, that have all the Pedigrees in the World in their Heads, will tell ye, that the Bride comes of a better Family than he; but that's not minded now-a-days, for Money you know will hide many Faults. And indeed, this ſame <hi>Camacho</hi> is as free as a Prince, and deſigns to ſpare no Coſt upon his Wedding. He has taken a Fancy to get the Meadow ſhaded with Boughs, that are to cover it like an Arbour, ſo that the Sun will have much ado to peep through, and viſit the green Graſs underneath. There are alſo provided for the Diverſion of the Company ſeveral ſorts of Anticks and Morrice-dancers, ſome with Swords, and ſome with Bells; for there are young Fellows in his Village can manage 'em cleverly. I ſay nothing of thoſe that play Tricks with the Soles of their Shooes when they Dance, leaving that to the Judgment of the Gueſts. But
<pb n="803" facs="tcp:54446:437"/>
nothing that I've told, or might tell you of this Wedding, is like to make it ſo remarkable as thoſe which I imagine poor <hi>Baſil</hi>'s Deſpair will do. This <hi>Baſil</hi> is a young Fellow, that lives next door to <hi>Quiteria</hi>'s Father. Hence Love took occaſion to give Birth to an Amour, like that of old between <hi>Pyramus</hi> and <hi>Thisbe;</hi> for <hi>Baſil</hi>'s Love grew up with him from a Child, and ſhe encourag'd his Paſſion with all the kind return that Modeſty could grant; inſomuch, that the Mutual Affection of the two little ones, was the common talk of the Village. But <hi>Quiteria</hi> coming to Years of Maturity, her Father began to deny <hi>Baſil</hi> the uſual acceſs to his Houſe; and to cut off his farther Pretences, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd his Reſolution of Marrying her to <hi>Camacho,</hi> who is indeed his Superior in Eſtate, though far ſhort of him in all other Qualifications; for <hi>Baſil,</hi> to give the Devil his due, is the clevereſt Fellow we have, he'll pitch ye a Bar, Wreſtle, or play at Tennis with the beſt He in the Country; he runs like a Stag, leaps like a Buck, plays at Nine-pins ſo well, you'd think he tips 'em down by Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, ſings like a Lark, touches a Guitar ſo rarely, he even makes it ſpeak; and to compleat his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, he handles a Sword like a Fencer. For that very ſingle Qualification, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> he deſerves not only <hi>Quiteria the handſome,</hi> but a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; nay, Queen <hi>Guinever</hi> her ſelf, where ſhe now living, in ſpight of Sir <hi>Lancelot</hi> and all that would oppoſe it. Well, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> who had been ſilent, and liſt'ning all the while, my Wife us'd to tell me, ſhe would have every one Marry with their Match. Like to like, quoth the Devil to the Collier, and every Sow to her own Trough, as t'other Saying is: As for my part, all I would have is, that honeſt <hi>Baſil</hi> e'en Marry her; for methinks I have a huge liking to the young Man, and ſo
<pb n="804" facs="tcp:54446:438"/>
Heaven bleſs them together, ſay I, and a Murrain ſeize thoſe that will ſpoil a good Match be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe that love one another! Nay, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> if Marriage ſhould be always the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of mutual Love, what would become of the Prerogative of Parents, and their Authority over their Children? If young Girls might always chuſe their own Husbands, we ſhould have the beſt Families intermarry with Coachmen and Grooms; and young Heireſſes would throw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves away upon the firſt young wild Fellows, whoſe promiſing out-ſides and aſſurance makes 'em ſet up for Fortunes, though all their Stock conſiſts in Impudence. For, the Underſtanding, which alone ſhould diſtinguiſh and chuſe in theſe Caſes as in all others, is apt to be blinded or biaſs'd by Love and Affection; and Matrimony is ſo nice and critical a point, that it requires not only our own cautious Management, but even the Direction of a ſuperiour Power to chuſe right. Whoever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes a Voyage, if he be Wiſe, makes it his buſineſs to find out an agreeable Companion. How Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then ſhould he be, who muſt take a Journey for Life, whoſe Fellow-Traveller muſt be as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable from him as himſelf; his Companion at Bed and Board, and ſharer of all the Pleaſures and Fatigues of his Journey; as the Wife muſt be to the Husband! She is no ſuch ſort of Ware, that a Man can be rid of when he pleaſes: When once that's purchas'd, no Exchange, no Sale, no Alienati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can be made: She is an inſeparable Acident to Man: Marriage is a Nooſe, which, faſten'd about the Neck, runs the cloſer, and ſits more uneaſie by our ſtruggling to get looſe; 'tis a <hi>Gordian</hi> Knot which none can untie, and being twiſted with our Thread of Life, nothing but the Scythe of Death can cut it. I could dwell longer on this Subject, but that I long to know from the Gentleman,
<pb n="805" facs="tcp:54446:438"/>
whether he can tell us any thing more of <hi>Baſil?</hi> All I can tell you, ſaid the Student, is, that he's in the Caſe of all Deſperate Lovers; ſince the moment he heard of this intended Marriage, he has never been ſeen to ſmile or talk rationally, he is in a deep Melancholy, that might indeed rather be call'd a dozing Frenzy; he talks to himſelf, and ſeems out of his Senſes, he hardly Eats or Sleeps, and lives like a Salvage in the open Fields; his only Suſtenance a little Fruit, and his only Bed the hard Ground; ſometimes he lifts up his Eyes to Heaven, then fixes them on the Ground, and in either Poſture ſtands like a Statue. In ſhort, he is reduc'd to that Condition, that we who are his Acquaintance verily believe, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of this Wedding to Morrow will be attended by his Death. Heav'n forbid, Marry and Amen, cry'd <hi>Sancho!</hi> Who can tell what may happen? He that gives a broken Head can give a Plaiſter. This is one day, but to morrow is another, and ſtrange things may fall in the roaſting of an Egg. After a Storm comes a Calm. Many a Man that went to Bed well, has found himſelf dead in the Morning when he awak'd. Who can put a Spoke in Fortune's Wheel? No Body here I'm ſure. Between a Woman's yea and nay, I would not engage to put a Pin's-point, ſo cloſe they be one to another. If Mrs. <hi>Quiteria</hi> love Maſter <hi>Baſil,</hi> ſhe'll give <hi>Camacho</hi> the Bag to hold; for this ſame Love, they ſay, looks thro' Spectacles, that make Copper look like Gold, a Cart like a Coach, and a Shrimp like a Lobſter. Whether in the name of Ill-luck, art thou run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning now <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quixote?</hi> When thou fall'ſt to threading thy Proverbs, and old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Sayings, the Devil can't cut thee ſhort. What do'ſt thou know, poor Animal, of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, or her Wheel, or any thing elſe? Why,
<pb n="806" facs="tcp:54446:439"/>
truly Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> if you don't underſtand me, no wonder if my Sentences be thought Non-ſenſe. But let that paſs, I underſtand my ſelf; and I'm ſure I han't talk'd ſo much like a Ninny. But you forſooth are ſo ſharp a Cricket. A Critick, Blockhead, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> thou confounded Corrupter of humane Speech! By yea, and by nay, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> what makes you ſo Angry, Sir? I was never brought up at School nor Varſity to know when I murder a hard Word. I was never at Court to learn to Spell Sir. Some are born in one Town, ſome in another; one at St. <hi>Jago,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at <hi>Toledo,</hi> and even there all are not ſo nicely ſpoken. You are in the right, Friend, ſaid the Student; Thoſe Natives of that City, who live among the Tanners, or about the Market of <hi>Zoco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dover,</hi> and are confin'd to mean Converſation, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpeak ſo well as thoſe that frequent the polite part of the Town, and yet they are all of <hi>Toledo.</hi> But Propriety, Purity and Elegance of Style, may be found among the Gentry, and Men of Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Judgement; and 'tis the Spring and Grammar of good Language, though Practice and Example will go a great way. As for my part, I have had the happineſs of good Education; it has been my Fortune to ſtudy the Civil Law at <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manca,</hi> and I have made it my Buſineſs all along to expreſs my ſelf properly, neither like a Ruſtick nor a Pedant. Ay, ay, Sir, ſaid the other Student, your Parts might have qualify'd you for a Maſter of Arts Degree, had you not miſ-employ'd 'em in minding ſo much thoſe fooliſh Foils you carry about with you, and that make you lag behind your Juniors. Look you, good Sir Batchelor, ſaid the other, your mean Opinion of theſe Foils is Erroneous and Abſurd; for I can deduce the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the Art of Fencing from ſeveral unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable Axioms: Pſhaw, ſaid <hi>Corchuelo,</hi> for ſo was
<pb n="807" facs="tcp:54446:439"/>
the other call'd, don't tell me of Axioms: I'll fight you, Sir, at your own Weapons. Here am I that underſtand neither Quart, nor Tierce; but I have an Arm, I have Strength, and I have Courage. Give me one of your Foils, and in ſpight of all your Diſtances, Circles, Falſifies, Angles, and all other Terms of your Art, I'll ſhew you there's nothing in't, and will make Reaſon glitter in your Eyes. That Man breaths not Vital Air, that I will turn my Back on. And he muſt have more than human Force, that can ſtand his Ground againſt me. As for ſtanding Ground, ſaid the Artiſt, I won't be oblig'd to't. But have a care, Sir, how you preſs upon a Man of Skill, for ten to one at the very firſt advance, but he's in your Body up to the Hilt. I'll try that preſently, ſaid <hi>Corchuelo,</hi> and ſpringing briskly from his Aſs, ſnatch'd one of the Foils which the Student carry'd; Hold, hold, Sir, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> I will ſtand Judge of the Field, and ſee fair Play on both ſides; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſing with his Lance, he alighted, and gave the Artiſt time to put himſelf in his Poſture, and take his diſtance. Then <hi>Corchuelo</hi> ſlew at him like a Fury, helter skelter, Cut and Thruſt, back-ſtroke and fore-ſtroke, ſingle and double, and laid on like any Lion. But the Student ſtopp'd him in the middle of his Career with ſuch a dab in the Teeth, that he made <hi>Corchuelo</hi> foam at the Mouth. He made him kiſs the Button of his Foil, as if it had been a Relick, though not altogether with ſo much Devotion. In ſhort, he told all the Buttons of his ſhort Caſſock with pure clean Stockadoes, and made the skirts of it hang about him in Rags like Fiſh-tails. Twice he ſtruck off his Hat, and in fine, ſo mawl'd and tir'd him, that through perfect Vexation <hi>Corchuelo</hi> took the Foil by the Hilt, and hurl'd it from him with ſuch Violence,
<pb n="808" facs="tcp:54446:440"/>
that one of the Country-men that were by, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening to be a Notary Publick, has it upon Record to this Day, that he threw it almoſt three quarters of a League; which Teſtimony has ſerv'd, and yet ſerves to let Poſterity know that Strength is overcome by Art. At laſt <hi>Corchuelo</hi> puffing and blowing ſat down to reſt himſelf, and <hi>Sancho</hi> coming up to him: Mr. Batchelour, quoth he, henceforwards take a Fool's Advice, and never challenge a Man to Fence, but to Wreſtle or pitch the Bar; you ſeem cut out for thoſe Sports: But this Fencing is a tickliſh point, Sir, meddle no more with it; for I have heard ſome of your Maſters of the Science ſay, they can hit the Eye of a Needle with the Point of a Sword. <hi>Corchuelo</hi> acknowledg'd himſelf convinc'd of an Error by Experience, and embracing the Artiſt, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came better Friends than before. So, without ſtaying for the Notary that went for the Foil, and could not be back in a great while, they put on to the Town where <hi>Quiteria</hi> liv'd, they all dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the ſame Village. By the Way the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent held forth upon the Excellency of the Noble Science of Defence, with ſo many plain and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Reaſons, drawn from expreſſive Figures and Mathematical Demonſtrations, that all were ſatisfy'd of the Excellency of the Art, and <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuelo</hi> was reduc'd from his Incredulity. 'Twas now pretty dark, but before they got to the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, it appear'd entirely a blazing Conſtellation: Their Ears were entertain'd with the pleaſing, but confus'd ſounds of ſeveral ſorts of Muſick, Drums, Fiddles, Pipes, Tabors and Bells; and as they approach'd nearer ſtill, they found a large Arbour at the entrance of the Town, ſtuck full of Lights, which burnt undiſturb'd by the leaſt breeze of Wind. The Muſicians, which are the Life
<pb n="809" facs="tcp:54446:440"/>
and Soul of Diverſion at a Wedding, went up and down in Bands about the Meadow. In ſhort, ſome Danc'd, ſome Sung, ſome Play'd, and Mirth and Jollity Revell'd through that delicious Seat of Pleaſure. Others were employ'd in raiſing Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds for the better view of the Shows and Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments prepair'd for the happy <hi>Camacho</hi>'s Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and likewiſe to Solemnize poor <hi>Baſil</hi>'s Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. All the Perſwaſions and Endeavours of the Students and Country-men could not move Don <hi>Quixote</hi> to enter the Town; urging for his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the Cuſtom of Knight-Errants, who choſe to Lodge in Fields and Foreſts under the Canopy of Heav'n, rather than in ſoft Beds under a gilded Roof; and therefore he left 'em, and went a little out of the Road, full ſore againſt <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Will, who had not yet forgot the good Lodging and Entertainment he had at Don <hi>Diego</hi>'s Houſe or Caſtle.</p>

<pb n="810" facs="tcp:54446:441"/>
Man's Greatneſs, ſecure thou ſleep'ſt, thy Soul compos'd and calm! No Power of Magick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutes thee, nor are thy Thoughts affrighted by Inchantments. Sleep on, ſleep on, a hundred times, ſleep on. Thoſe Jealous Cares that break a Lover's Heart do not extend to thee; neither the dread of craving Creditors, nor the diſmal foreſight of inevitable Want, or care of finding Bread for a helpleſs ſtarving Family, keep thee waking. Ambition does not make thee uneaſie, the Pomp and Vanity of this World do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex thy Mind, for all thy Care's extent reaches but to thy Aſs. Thy Perſon and thy Welfare thou haſt committed to my Charge, a Burden impos'd on Maſters by Nature and Cuſtom, to weigh and counterpoiſe the Offices of Servants. Which is the greateſt Slave? The Servant's Buſineſs is perform'd by a few Manual Duties, which only reconcile him more to Reſt, and make him ſleep more ſound; while the anxious Maſter has not leiſure to cloſe his Eyes, but muſt Labour Day and Night to make Proviſion for the Subſiſtence of his Servant; not only in time of Abundance, but even when the Heavens deny thoſe kindly Showers that muſt ſupply his want. To all this fine Expoſtulation <hi>Sancho</hi> anſwer'd not a Word; but ſlept on, and was not to be wak'd by his Maſter's calling or otherwiſe, till he prick'd him in the Buttocks with the ſharp end of his Lance. At length opening his Eye-lids half way, and rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing them, after he had gap'd and yawn'd, and ſtretch'd his drowſy Limbs; he look'd about him, and ſnuffing up his Noſe, I'm much miſtaken, quoth he, if from this ſame Arbour there come not a pure ſteam of good broil'd Raſhers, that comforts my Noſtrils, more than all the Herbs and Ruſhes hereabouts. And by my Holy Dame,
<pb n="811" facs="tcp:54446:441"/>
a Wedding that begins ſo ſavourly, muſt be a dainty one. Away Cormorant, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> rouſe and let's go ſee it, and learn how it fares with the Diſdain'd <hi>Baſil.</hi> Fare? quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> why if he be poor, he muſt e'en be ſo ſtill, and not think to Marry <hi>Quiteria.</hi> 'Tis a pretty Fancy, i'faith! For a Fellow who has not a Croſs, to run Madding after what is Meat for his Betters. I'll lay my Neck that <hi>Camacho</hi> covers this ſame <hi>Baſil</hi> from Head to Foot with white Six pences, and will ſpend ye more at a Breakfaſt than t'other's worth, and be ne'er the worſe. And d'ye think that Madam <hi>Quiteria</hi> will quit her fine rich Gowns and Petticoats, her Necklaces of Pearl, her Jewels, her Finery and Bravery, and all that <hi>Camacho</hi> has given her, or may afford to give her, to Marry a Fellow with whom ſhe muſt Knit or Spin for her Living? What ſignifies his Bar-pitching and Fencing? Will that pay for a Pint of Wine at the Tavern? If all thoſe rare Parts won't go to Market and make the Pot boil, the duce take 'em for me: Though where they light on a Man that has wherewithal, may I ever live thus, if they don't ſet him off rarely. With good Materials on a good Foundation, a Man may Build a good Houſe, and Money is the beſt Foundation in the World. For Heaven's ſake <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote,</hi> prithee bring thy tedious Harangue to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. For my part, I believe, wer't thou let alone, when thy Clack is once ſet a going, thou would'ſt ſcarce allow thy ſelf time to eat or ſleep, but would'ſt prate on to the end of the Chapter. Troth Maſter! reply'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> your Memory muſt be very ſhort, not to remember the Articles of our Agreement before I came this laſt Journey with you. I was to ſpeak what I would, and when I would, provided I ſaid nothing againſt my
<pb n="812" facs="tcp:54446:442"/>
Neighbour, or your Worſhip's Authority; and I don't ſee that I have broken my Indentures yet. I remember no ſuch Article, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and though it were ſo, 'tis my Pleaſure you now be ſilent and attend me; for the Inſtruments we heard laſt Night begin to cheer the Vallies, and doubtleſs the Marriage will be Solemniz'd this Morning, e'er the heat of the Day prevent the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. Thereupon <hi>Sancho</hi> ſaid no more but Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dl'd <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and clapp'd his Pack-Saddle on <hi>Dapple</hi>'s Back; then both mounting, away they rode fair and ſoftly into the Arbour. The firſt thing that bleſs'd <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Sight there, was a whole Steer Spitted on a large Elm, before a mighty Fire made of a Pile of Wood, that ſeem'd a flaming Mountain. Round this Bonfire were plac'd ſix capacious Pots, caſt in no common Mould, or rather ſix ample Coppers, every one containing a whole Shamble of Meat, and entire Sheep were ſunk and loſt in them, and ſoak'd as conveniently as Pigeons. The Branches of the Trees round were all garniſh'd with an infinite number of Cas'd Hares, and pluck'd Fowl of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts: And then for Drink, <hi>Sancho</hi> told above threeſcore Skins of Wine, holding each of 'em ſeven Gallons at leaſt, and as it afterwards prov'd, ſprightly Liquor. A goodly pile of white Loaves made a large Rampart on the one ſide, and a ſtately Wall of Cheeſes ſet up like Bricks made a comely Bulwark on the other. Two Pans of Oil, each bigger than a Dyer's Fat, ſerv'd to fry their Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cakes, which they lifted out with two ſtrong Peels when they were fry'd enough, and then they dipp'd 'em in as large a Kettle of Honey prepar'd for that purpoſe. To dreſs all this Proviſion, there were above fifty Cooks, Men and Women, all cleanly, diligent and chearful: In the ample
<pb n="813" facs="tcp:54446:442"/>
Belly of the Steer they had ſew'd up twelve little ſucking Piggs embowell'd, to give it the more ſavoury Taſte. Spices of all ſorts lay about in ſuch Plenty, that they appear'd to be bought by whole-ſale. In ſhort, the whole Proviſion was indeed Country-like, but plentiful enough to feaſt an Army. <hi>Sancho</hi> beheld all this with wonder and delight. The firſt Temptation that captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Senſes was the goodly Pots; his Bowels yearn'd, and his Mouth water'd at the dainty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents: By and by he falls deſperately in Love with the Skins of Wine; and laſtly, his affections were fix'd on the Fryingpans, if ſuch honourable Ket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles may accept of the Name. The ſcent of the fry'd Meat put him into ſuch a commotion of Spirit that he could hold out no longer, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſting one of the buſie Cooks, with all the ſmooth and hungry Reaſons he was Maſter of, he begg'd his leave to ſop a Luncheon of Bread in one of the Pans. Friend, quoth the Cook, no hunger muſt be felt near us to Day (thanks to the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) Light, light Man, and if thou canſt find ever a Ladle there, skim out a Pullet or two, and much good may do you. Alack a day, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I ſee no Ladle, Sir. Blood and Suet cry'd the Cook, what a ſilly helpleſs Fellow thou art! Let me ſee: With that he took a Kettle, and ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing into one of the Pots, he fiſh'd out three Hens and a couple of Geeſe at one heave. Here, Friend, ſaid he to <hi>Sancho,</hi> take this, and make ſhift to ſtay your Stomach with that <hi>Scum</hi> till Dinner be ready. Heaven reward you, cry'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> but where ſhall I put it? Here, anſwer'd the Cook, take Ladle and all, and thank the Founder, once more I ſay; no Body will grudge it thee. While <hi>Sancho</hi> was thus employ'd, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ſaw twelve young Farmers Sons all Dreſs'd very Gay, enter upon

ſtately Mares, as richly and gaudily equipp'd as the Country could afford, with little Bells faſten'd to their Furniture. Theſe in a cloſe Body made ſeveral Careers up and down the Meadow, merrily ſhouting and crying out, long live <hi>Camacho,</hi> and <hi>Quiteria,</hi> he as rich as ſhe Fair, and ſhe the faireſt in the World. Poor Ignorants (thought Don <hi>Quixote</hi> over-hearing them) you ſpeak as you know; but had you ever ſeen my <hi>Dulcinea del To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſo,</hi> you would not be ſo laviſh of your Praiſes here. In a little while, at ſeveral other parts of the ſpacious Arbour enter'd a great Number of Dancers, and among the reſt twenty four young active Country-Lads in their fine Holland-Shirts, with their Handkerchiefs wrought with ſeveral Colours of fine Silk, wound about their Heads, each of 'em with Sword in Hand. Theſe Danc'd a Military Dance, and skirmiſh'd with one another, mixing and intermixing with their naked Swords, with wonderful ſleight and activity, without hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each other in the leaſt. This Dance pleas'd Don <hi>Quixote</hi> mightily, and tho' he was no ſtranger to ſuch ſort of Dances, he thought it the beſt he had ever ſeen. There was another he alſo lik'd very well, perform'd all by moſt Beautiful young Maids, between fourteen and eighteen years of Age, clad in ſlight green, with their Hair partly filletted up with Ribbons, and partly hanging looſe about their Shoulders, as bright and lovely as the Sun's Golden Beams. Above all, they wore Garlands of Roſes, Jaſmine, Amaranth, and Honey-ſuckles. They were led up by a Reverend Old Man, and a Matronly Woman, both much more Light and Active than their years ſeem'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. They Danc'd to the Muſick of <hi>Zamora</hi> Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipes, and ſuch was the Modeſty of their Looks, and the agility of their Feet, that they appear'd
<pb n="815" facs="tcp:54446:443"/>
the prettieſt Dancers in the World. After theſe came in an artificial Dance or Maſque, conſiſting of eight Nymphs, caſt into two Diviſions, of which <hi>Love</hi> led one, and <hi>Wealth</hi> the other; one with his Wings, his Bow, his Arrows, and his Quiver; the other array'd in ſeveral gaudy Colours of Gold and Silk. The Nymphs of <hi>Cupid</hi>'s Party had their Names inſcribed in large Characters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind their Backs. The firſt was <hi>Poeſy, Prudence</hi> was the next, the third <hi>Nobility,</hi> and <hi>Valour</hi> was the fourth. Thoſe that attended <hi>Wealth</hi> were <hi>Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, Reward, Treaſure,</hi> and <hi>Peaceable Poſſeſſion.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn by four Savages, clad in green, cover'd over with Ivy, and grim ſurly Vizzards on their Faces, ſo to the Life that they had almoſt fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Sancho.</hi> On the Frontiſpiece and on every quarter of the Edifice was inſcrib'd, the Caſtle of <hi>Reſervedneſs.</hi> Four expert Muſicians play'd to them on Pipe and Tabor. <hi>Cupid</hi> began the Dance, and after two Movements, he caſt up his Eyes, and bent his Bow againſt a Virgin that ſtood upon the Battlements of the Caſtle, addreſſing himſelf in this manner.</p>

                        <p>In this Manner all the Perſons of each Party advanc'd and ſpoke their Verſes, of which ſome were pretty and ſome fooliſh enough. Among the reſt, Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> who had a very good Memory, remember'd only theſe. After this, the two Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions joyn'd into a very pretty Country-Dance; and ſtill as <hi>Cupid</hi> paſs'd by the Caſtle he ſhot a Flight of Arrows, and <hi>Wealth</hi> batter'd it with golden Balls; then drawing out a great Purſe of <hi>Roman</hi> Cat's-Skin that ſeem'd full of Money, he threw it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Caſtle, the Boards of which were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently diſjointed, and fell down, leaving the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin diſcover'd without any Defence. Thereupon <hi>Wealth</hi> immediately enter'd with his Party, and throwing a Gold Chain about her Neck, made a Shew of leading her Priſoner: But then <hi>Cupid</hi> with his Attendants came to her Reſcue; and both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties engaging, were parted by the Savages, who joining the Boards together, enclos'd the Virgin as before; and all was perform'd with Meaſure, and to the Muſick, that played all the while; and ſo the Show ended to the great Content of the
<pb n="818" facs="tcp:54446:445"/>
Spectators. When all was over, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ask'd one of the Nymphs who it was that compos'd the Entertainment? She anſwer'd that it was a certain Clergyman who liv'd in their Town that had a rare Talent that way. I dare lay a Wager, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> he was more a Friend to <hi>Baſil</hi> than to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macho,</hi> and knows better what belongs to a Play than a Prayer-Book: He has expreſs'd <hi>Baſil</hi>'s Parts and <hi>Camacho</hi>'s Eſtate very naturally in the Deſign of your Dance. God bleſs the King and <hi>Camacho</hi> ſay I, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> who heard this. Well! <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſays Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> thou art a white-liver'd Rogue to change Parties this Way; thou'rt like the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which always cry, Long live the Conqueror. I know not what I'm like, reply'd <hi>Sancho;</hi> but this I know, that this Kettle full of Geeſe and Hens is a Bribe for a Prince. <hi>Camacho</hi> has fill'd my Belly, and therefore has won my Heart. When ſhall I ladle out ſuch dainty Scum out of <hi>Baſil</hi>'s Porridge-Pots (added he, ſhewing his Maſter the Meat, and falling on luſtily); therefore a Fig for his Abilities ſay I. As he ſows ſo let him reap, and as he reaps ſo let him ſow. My old Grannam (reſt her Soul) was wont to ſay, there were but two Families in the World, <hi>Have much</hi> and <hi>Have little;</hi> and ſhe had ever a great Kindneſs for the Family of the <hi>Have much.</hi> A Doctor gives his Advice by the Pulſe of your Pocket; and an Aſs cover'd with Gold, looks better than an Horſe with a Pack-Saddle; ſo once more I ſay <hi>Camacho</hi> for my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Haſt thou not done yet? ſaid Don <hi>Quixote.</hi> I muſt have done, anſwer'd <hi>Sancho;</hi> becauſe I find you begin to be in a Paſſion, elſe I had Work cut out for three Days and a Half. Well! ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> thou wilt never be ſilent till thy Mouth's full of Clay; when thou'rt dead I hope I ſhall have ſome Reſt. Faith and Troth now Maſter,
<pb n="819" facs="tcp:54446:445"/>
quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> you did ill to talk of Death; Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven bleſs us, 'tis no Child's Play; you've e'en ſpoil'd my Dinner; the very Thought of raw Bones and lanthorn Jaws makes me ſick. Death eats up all things, both the young Lamb and old Sheep; and I have heard our Parſon ſay he values a Prince no more than a Clown; all's Fiſh that comes to his Net; he throws at all, and ſweeps Stakes; he's no Mower that takes a Nap at Noon-Day, but drives on, fair Weather or foul, and cuts down the green Graſs as well as the ripe Corn: He's neither ſqueamiſh nor queaſy-ſtomach'd, for he ſwallows without chewing, and crams down all things into his ungracious Maw; and though you can ſee no Belly he has, he has a confounded Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, and thirſts after Mens Lives, which he guggles down like Mother's Milk. Hold, hold, cry'd the Knight, go no further, for thou art come to a very handſome Period; thou haſt ſaid as much of Death in thy home-ſpun Cant, as a good Preacher could have done: Thou haſt got the Knack of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Man; I muſt get thee a Pulpit and Benefice I think. He preaches well that lives well, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> that's all the Divinity I underſtand. Thou haſt enough, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> only I wonder at one thing, 'tis ſaid the Beginning of Wiſdom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the Fear of Heaven; how happens it then, that thou who feareſt a Lizard more than Omnipotence ſhould'ſt be ſo wiſe? Come, Sir, reply'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> judge you of your Knight-Erran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and don't meddle with other Men's Fears; for I am as pretty a Fearer of Heaven as any of my Neighbours; and ſo let me diſpatch this Scum, (and much Good may't do thee honeſt <hi>Sancho;</hi>) Conſider, Sir, we muſt give an Account for our idle Words another Day; I muſt have t'other Pluck at the Kettle. With that he attack'd it with
<pb n="820" facs="tcp:54446:446"/>
ſo couragious an Appetite that he ſharpen'd his Maſter's, who would certainly have kept him Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, had he not been prevented by that which Neceſſity obliges me to relate this Inſtant.</p>

                        <p>WHILE Don <hi>Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> were diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, as the former Chapter has told you, they were interrupted by a great Noiſe of Joy and Acclamations rais'd by the Horſemen, who ſhout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and galloping went to meet the young Couple, who, ſurrounded by a thouſand Inſtruments and Devices, were coming to the Arbour, accompany'd by the Curate, their Relations, and all the better ſort of the Neighbourhood, ſet out in their Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day-Cloaths. Hey-day! quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> as ſoon as he ſaw the Bride, what have we here? Adzuckers this is no Country-Laſs, but a fine City-Dame, all in her Silks and Sattins, by the Maſs! Look, look ye Maſter, ſee if inſtead of Glaſs Necklaces, ſhe have not on Fillets of rich Coral; and inſtead of green Serge of <hi>Cuenca,</hi> a thirty-pil'd Velvet. I'll warrant her Lacing is white Linnen; but hold, may I never ſquint if it ben't Sattin. Bleſs us! ſee what Rings ſhe has on her Fingers, no Jet, no pewter Bawbles, pure beaten Gold, as I'm a Sinner, and ſet with Pearls too! If every Pearl ben't as white as a Syllabub, and each of them as precious as an Eye! How ſhe's bedizon'd, and
<pb n="821" facs="tcp:54446:446"/>
gliſtens from Top to Toe! And now yonder again, what fine long Locks the young Slut has got! If they ben't falſe, I ne'er ſaw longer in my born Days. Ah Jade! what a fine ſtately Perſon ſhe is! What a many Trinkets and glaring Gugaws are dangling in her Hair and about her Neck! Cudz-niggers! ſhe puts me in mind of an over-loaden Date-tree. I'my Conſcience! ſhe's a juicy bit, a Mettl'd Wench, and might well paſs Muſter in <hi>Flanders.</hi> Well! I ſay no more, but happy is the Man that has thee! Don <hi>Quixote</hi> could not help ſmiling to hear <hi>Sancho</hi> ſet forth the Bride after his Ruſtick way, though at the ſame time he beheld her with admiration, thinking her the moſt Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Woman he had ever ſeen, except his Miſtreſs <hi>Dulcinea:</hi> However, the fair <hi>Quiteria</hi> appear'd ſomewhat pale, probably with the ill Reſt which Brides commonly have the Night before their Marriage, in order to Dreſs themſelves to Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. There was a large Scaffold erected on one ſide of the Meadow, and adorn'd with Carpets and Boughs for the Marriage-Ceremony, and the more convenient Proſpect of the Shows and Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Proceſſion was juſt arriv'd to this Place, when they heard a piercing out-cry, and a voice calling out, Stay, raſh and haſty People, ſtay; upon which all turning about, they ſaw a Perſon coming after them in a black Coat border'd with Crimſon, powder'd with Flames of Fire. On his Head he wore a Garland of mournful Cypreſs, and a large Truncheon in his Hand, headed with an Iron Spike. As ſoon as he drew near they knew him to be the gallant <hi>Baſil,</hi> and the whole Aſſembly began to fear ſome Miſchief would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, ſeeing him come thus unlook'd for, and with ſuch an Outcry and Behaviour. He came up tir'd and panting before the Bride and Bridegoom; then
<pb n="822" facs="tcp:54446:447"/>
leaning on his Truncheon, he fix'd his Eyes on <hi>Quiteria,</hi> turning pale and trembling at the ſame time, and with a fearful hollow Voice, Too well you know, cry'd he, unkind <hi>Quiteria,</hi> that by the Ties of Truth, and Law of that Heaven which we all revere, while I have Life you cannot be marry'd to another. You may remember too, that all the while I ſtay'd, hoping that Time and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry might better my Fortune, and render me a Match more equal for you, I never offer'd to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend the Bounds of honourable Love, by ſollicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Favours to the Prejudice of your Virtue. But you, forgetting all the Ties between us, are going now to break 'em, and give my Right to another, whoſe large Poſſeſſions, tho' they can procure him all other Bleſſings, I had never envy'd, could they not have purchas'd you. But no more, the Fates have ordain'd it, and I will further their Deſign, by removing this unhappy Obſtacle out of your Way. Live, rich <hi>Camacho,</hi> live happy with the ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Quiteria</hi> many Years, and let the poor, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable <hi>Baſil</hi> die, whoſe Poverty has clipp'd the Wings of his Felicity, and laid him in the Grave. Saying theſe laſt Words, he drew out of his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd Truncheon a ſhort Tuck that was conceal'd in it, and ſetting the Hilt of it to the Ground, he fell upon the Point in ſuch a Manner that it came out all bloody at his Back, the poor Wretch wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring on the Ground in Blood. His Friends ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confounded by this ſad Accident, ran to help him, and Don <hi>Quixote</hi> forſaking <hi>Rozinante,</hi> made Haſte to his Aſſiſtance, and taking him up in his Arms, found there was ſtill Life in him. They would fain have drawn the Sword out of his Body, but the Curate urg'd it was not convenient till he had made his Confeſſion, and prepar'd himſelf for Death, which would immediately attend the Effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="823" facs="tcp:54446:447"/>
of Blood upon pulling the Tuck out of his Body. While they were debating this Point, <hi>Baſil</hi> ſeem'd to come a little to himſelf, and calling on the Bride. Oh.! <hi>Quiteria,</hi> (ſaid he, with a faint and doleful Voice) now, now in this laſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting Minute of my Life, even in this dreadful Agony of Death, would you but vouchſafe to give me your Hand, and own your ſelf my Wife, I ſhould think my ſelf rewarded for the Torments I endure; and pleas'd to think this deſparate Deed made me yours, tho' but for a Moment, I would die contented. The Curate hearing this, very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly recommended to him the Care of his Soul's Health, which at the preſent Juncture was more proper than any Gratification of his outward Man; that his Time was but ſhort, and he ought to be very earneſt with Heaven, in imploring its Mercy and Forgiveneſs for all his Sins, but eſpecially for his laſt deſperate Action. To which <hi>Baſil</hi> anſwer'd, That he could think of no Happineſs till <hi>Quiteria</hi> yielded to be his; but if ſhe would do it, that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction would calm his Spirits, and diſpoſe him to confeſs himſelf heartily. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> hearing this, cry'd out aloud, That <hi>Baſil</hi>'s Demand was juſt and reaſonable, and that Signior <hi>Camacho</hi> might as honourably receive her as the worthy <hi>Baſil</hi>'s Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, as if he had receiv'd her at her Father's Hands. Say but the Word, Madam, continu'd he, pronounce it once to ſave a Man from Deſpair and Damnation; you will not be long bound to it, ſince the nuptial Bed of this Bridegroom muſt be the Grave. <hi>Camacho</hi> ſtood all this while ſtrangely confounded, till at laſt he was prevail'd on by the repeated Importunities of <hi>Baſil</hi>'s Friends to conſent that <hi>Quiteria</hi> ſhould humour the dying Man, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her own Happineſs would be deferr'd but ſome few Minutes longer. Then they all bent their

Methinks, quoth <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> this young Man talks too much for a Man in his Condition; pray adviſe him to leave off his Wooing, and mind his Soul's Health. I'm afraid his Death is more in his Tongue than in his Teeth. Now when <hi>Baſil</hi> and <hi>Quiteria</hi> had thus plighted their Faith to each other, while yet their Hands were joyn'd together, the tender-hearted Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, with Tears in his Eyes, poured on 'em both the nuptial Bleſſing, beſeeching Heaven at the ſame Time to have Mercy on the new-marry'd Man's Soul, and in a Manner mixing the Burial-Service with the Matrimonial. As ſoon as the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction was pronounc'd, up ſtarts <hi>Baſil</hi> briskly from the Ground, and with an unexpected Activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty whips the Sword out of his Body, and caught his dear <hi>Quiteria</hi> cloſe in his Arms. All the Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators ſtood amaz'd, and ſome of the ſimpler ſort ſtuck not to cry out, A Miracle, a Miracle! No, no, cry'd <hi>Baſil,</hi> no Miracle, no Miracle, but a Stratagem, a Stratagem. The Curate, more aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd and concern'd than all the reſt, came with both his Hands to feel the Wound, and diſcover'd that the Sword had no where paſs'd through the cunning <hi>Baſil</hi>'s Body, but only through a Tin Pipe full of Blood artfully fitted to his Body, and, as it was afterwards known, ſo prepar'd that the Blood could not congeal. In ſhort, the Curate, <hi>Camacho,</hi> and the Company found they had all been egregiouſly impos'd upon. As for the Bride, ſhe was ſo far from being diſpleas'd, that hearing it urg'd that the Marriage could not ſtand good in
<pb n="826" facs="tcp:54446:449"/>
Law becauſe the Contrivance was deceitful, ſhe publickly declar'd that ſhe again confirm'd it to be juſt, and by the free Conſent of both Parties: <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macho</hi> and his Friends judging by this that the Trick was premeditated, and that ſhe was privy to the Plot, enrag'd at this horrid Diſappointment, had Recourſe to a ſtronger Argument, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Swords, ſet furiouſly on <hi>Baſil,</hi> in whoſe Defence almoſt as many were immediately un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheathed. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> immediately mounting, with his Lance couch'd, and cover'd with his Shield, led the Van of <hi>Baſil</hi>'s Party, and falling in with the Enemy, charg'd clear thro' the Groſs of their Battalia. <hi>Sancho,</hi> who never lik'd any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Work, reſolv'd to ſtand Neuter, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd under the Walls of the mighty Pot whence he had got the precious Skimmings, thinking that would be reſpected whatever Side gain'd the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> addreſſing himſelf to <hi>Camacho</hi>'s Party, Hold Gentlemen, cry'd he, 'tis not juſt thus with Arms to redreſs the Injuries of Love. Love and War are the ſame thing, and Stratagems and Policy are as allowable in the one as in the other. <hi>Quiteria</hi> was deſign'd for <hi>Baſil,</hi> and he for her by the unalterable Decrees of Heaven. <hi>Camacho</hi>'s Riches may purchaſe him a Bride and more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent elſewhere, and thoſe whom Heav'n has joyn'd let no Man put aſunder. <hi>Baſil</hi> had but this one Lamb, and the Lamb of his Boſome, let none therefore offer to take his ſingle Delight from him, though preſuming on his Power; for here I ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly declare, that he who firſt attempts it muſt paſs through me, and this Lance through him. At which he ſhook his Lance in the Air with ſo much Vigour and Dexterity, that he caſt a ſudden Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour into thoſe that beheld him, who did not know the threatning Champion. In ſhort, Don
<pb n="827" facs="tcp:54446:449"/>
                           <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Words, the good Curate's diligent Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, together with <hi>Quiteria</hi>'s Inconſtancy, brought <hi>Camacho</hi> to a Truce; and he then diſcreetly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, that ſince <hi>Quiteria</hi> lov'd <hi>Baſil</hi> before Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, 'twas probable ſhe would love him afterwards, and that therefore he had more Reaſon to thank Heaven for ſo good a Riddance, than to repine at her Loſs. This Thought, improv'd by ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Conſiderations, brought both Parties to a fair Accommodation; and <hi>Camacho,</hi> to ſhew he did not reſent the Diſappointment, blaming rather <hi>Quiteria</hi>'s Levity than <hi>Baſil</hi>'s Policy, invited the whole Company to ſtay, and take Share of what he had provided. But <hi>Baſil,</hi> whoſe Virtues, in ſpight of his Poverty, had ſecur'd him many Friends, drew away Part of the Company to attend him and his Bride to her own Town; and among the reſt Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> whom they all honour'd as a Perſon of extraordinary Worth and Bravery. Poor <hi>Sancho</hi> follow'd his Maſter with a heavy Heart; he could not be reconcil'd to the Thoughts of turning his Back ſo ſoon upon the good Cheer and Jollity at <hi>Camacho</hi>'s Feaſt, that laſted till Night, and had a ſtrange Hankering after thoſe dear Fleſh-Pots of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> which tho' he left behind in Reality, he yet carry'd along with him in Mind. The belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Scum which he had, that was nigh guttl'd alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, made him view with Sorrow the almoſt empty Kettle, the dear Casket where his Treaſure lay: So that ſtomaching mightily his Maſter's Defection from <hi>Camacho</hi>'s Feaſt, he ſullenly pac'd on after <hi>Rozinante,</hi> very much out of Humour, though he had juſt fill'd his Belly.</p>

                        <p>THE new Married Couple Entertain'd Don <hi>Quixote</hi> very Nobly, in Acknowledgment of his readineſs to defend their Cauſe; they eſteem'd his Wiſdom equal to his Valour, and thought him both a <hi>Cid</hi> in Arms, and a <hi>Cicero</hi> in Arts. Honeſt <hi>Sancho</hi> too recruited to the Purpoſe, during the three Days his Maſter ſtay'd, and ſo came to his good Humour again. <hi>Baſil</hi> then inform'd them, that <hi>Quiteria</hi> knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his Stratagems, but being a pure Device of his own, he had made ſome of his neareſt Friends acquainted with it, that they ſhould ſtand by him if occaſion were, and bring him off upon the Diſcovery of the Deceit. It deſerves a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomer Name, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> ſince conducive to ſo good and honourable an End, as the Marriage of a Loving Couple. By the way, Sir, you muſt know, that the greateſt Obſtacle to Love, is Want, and a narrow Fortune: For the continual Bands and Cements of mutual Affection are Mirth, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, Satisfaction, and Jollity. Theſe manag'd by skilful Hands can make Variety in the Pleaſures of Wedlock, preparing the ſame thing always with ſome additional Circumſtance, to render it new and delightful. But when preſſing Neceſſity and
<pb n="829" facs="tcp:54446:450"/>
Indigence deprive us of theſe Pleaſures that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Satiety, the Yoke of Matrimony is often found very galling; and the Burden intolerable. Theſe Words were chiefly directed by Don <hi>Quixote</hi> to <hi>Baſil,</hi> to adviſe him by the way to give over thoſe airy Sports and Exerciſes, which indeed might feed his Youth with Praiſe, but not his Old Age with Bread, and to bethink himſelf of ſome grave and ſubſtantial Employment that might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford him a Competency, and ſomething of a Stock for his declining Years. Then purſuing his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: The Honourable Poor Man, ſaid he, (if the Poor deſerves that Epithet) when he has a Beautiful Wife, is bleſs'd with a Jewel: He that deprives him of her, robs him of his Honour, and may be ſaid to deprive him of his Life. The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that is Beautiful, and keeps her Honeſty when her Husband is Poor, deſerves to be Crown'd with Laurel, as the Conquerors were of Old. Beauty is a tempting Bait, that attracts the Eyes of all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, and the Princely Eagles, and the moſt high-flown Birds ſtoop to its pleaſing Lure. But when they find it in Neceſſity, then Kites and Crows, and other ravenous Birds will all be grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the alluring Prey. She that can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand theſe dangerous Attacks, does merit to be the Crown of her Husband. However, Sir, take this along with you, as the Opinion of a Wiſe Man, whoſe Name I have forgot; he ſaid, there was but one good Woman in the World, and his Advice was, that every Married Man ſhould think his own Wife was ſhe, as being the only way to live contented. For my own part, I need not make the Application to my ſelf, for I am not Married, nor have I as yet any Thoughts that way; but if I had, 'twou'd not be a Woman's Fortune, but her Character ſhould recommend her;
<pb n="830" facs="tcp:54446:451"/>
for publick Reputation is the Life of a Lady's Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and the outward Appearance of Modeſty is in one Senſe as good as the Reality; ſince a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Sin is not ſo prejudicial in this World, as a publick Indecency. If you bring a Woman honeſt to your Boſom, 'tis eaſy keeping her ſo, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you may improve her Vertues. If you take an unchaſte Partner to your Bed, 'tis hard mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her; for the Extremes of Vice and Vertue are ſo great in a Woman, and their Points ſo far aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that 'tis very improbable, I won't ſay impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they ſhould ever be reconcil'd. <hi>Sancho,</hi> who had patiently Liſten'd ſo far, cou'd not forbear ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſome Remarks on his Maſter's Talk. This Maſter of mine, thought he to himſelf, when I am talking ſome good Things, full of Pith and Marrow, as he may be now, was wont to tell me, that I ſhould tie a Pulpit at my Back, and ſtroll with it about the World to retail my Rarities; but I might as well tell him, that when once he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to tack his Sentences together, a ſingle Pulpit is too little for him, he had need have two for every Finger, and go Peddling about the Market, and cry, who buys my Ware? Old Nick take him for a Knight-Errant! I think he's one of the ſeven Wiſe Maſters. I thought he knew nothing but his Knight-Errantry, but now I ſee the Devil a thing can 'ſcape him, he has an Oar in every Man's Boat, and a Finger in every Pye. As he mutter'd ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what loud, his Maſter over-heard him. What's that thou'rt Grumbling there, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid he? Nothing. Sir, nothing, quoth <hi>Sancho.</hi> I was only wiſhing I had heard your Worſhip Preach this Doctrine before I Married, then mayhaps I might have ſaid the old Proverb, A ſound Man needs no Phyſician. What, is <hi>Tereſa</hi> ſo bad then, ask'd Don <hi>Quixoie?</hi> Not ſo very bad neither, anſwer'd
<pb n="831" facs="tcp:54446:451"/>
                           <hi>Sancho;</hi> nor yet ſo good as I would have her. Fie, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> thou do'ſt not do well to ſpeak ill of thy Wife, who is a good Mother to thy Children. There's no Love loſt, Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> for ſhe ſpeaks as ill of me, when the Fit takes her, eſpecially when ſhe's in one of her Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Moods, for then Old Nick himſelf cou'd not bear her Maundring.</p>
                        <p>Don <hi>Quixote</hi> having tarried three Days with the young Couple, and been entertain'd like a Prince, he entreated the Student, who fenced ſo well, to help him to a Guide that might conduct him to <hi>Monteſino</hi>'s Cave, reſolving to go down into it, and prove by his own Eye-ſight the Wonders that were reported of it round the Country. The Student recommended a Couſin-German of his for his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor, who, he ſaid, was an Ingenious Lad, a pretty Scholar, and a great Admirer of Books of Knight-Errantry, and cou'd ſhew him the famous Lake of <hi>Ruydera</hi> too; adding, that he would be very good Company for the Knight, as being one that wrote Books for the Bookſellers, in order to Dedicate 'em to Great Men. Accordingly the Learned Couſin came mounted on an Aſs with Foal; his Pack-ſaddle cover'd with an old Carpet, or coarſe Packing-Cloth. Thereupon <hi>Sancho</hi> having got ready <hi>Rozinante</hi> and <hi>Dapple,</hi> well ſtuffed his Wallet, and the Student's Knap-ſack to boot, they all took their Leave, ſteering the neareſt Courſe to <hi>Monteſino</hi>'s Cave. To paſs the Time on the Road, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ask'd the Guide to what Courſe of Study he chiefly apply'd himſelf. Sir, anſwer'd the Scholar, my Buſineſs is Writing, and Copy-Money my chief Study. I have publiſh'd ſome Things with the general Approbation of the World, and much to my own Advantage. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, Sir, you may have heard of one of my Books,

call'd, <hi>The Treatiſe of Liveries and Devices;</hi> in which I have oblig'd the Publick with no leſs than ſeven Hundred and three ſorts of Liveries and Devices, with their Colours, Mottos, and Ciphers; ſo that any Courtier may furniſh himſelf there upon any extraordinary Appearance, with what may ſuit his Fancy or Circumſtances, without racking his own Invention to find what is agreeable to his Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.

'Tis plain you're in the right. O ho, am I ſo, Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho?</hi> Another Queſtion, by your Leave, Sir, Who was the firſt Tumbler in the World? Truly, Friend, anſwer'd the Student, that's a Point I cannot reſolve you without conſulting my Books; but as ſoon as ever I get home, I will ſtudy Night and Day to find it out. For two fair Words, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I'll ſave you that Trouble. Can you reſolve that Doubt, ask'd the Author? Ay, marry can I, ſaid <hi>Sancho:</hi> The firſt Tumbler in the World was <hi>Lucifer,</hi> when he was caſt out of Heaven he tumbl'd into Hell. You are poſitively in the right, ſaid the Scholar. Where did you get that, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quixote?</hi> For I dare ſwear 'tis none of your own. Mum! quoth <hi>Sancho.</hi> In ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of fooliſh Queſtions, and ſelling of Bargains, let <hi>Sancho</hi> alone, quo I; I don't want the help of my Neighbours. Truly, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> thou haſt given thy Queſtion a better Epithet than thou art aware of: For there are ſome Men who buſy their Heads, and loſe a World of Time in making Diſcoveries, the Knowledge of
<pb n="834" facs="tcp:54446:453"/>
which is good for nothing in Nature, unleſs it be to make the Diſcoveries Laugh'd at.</p>
                        <p>With theſe, and ſuch diverting Diſcourſes they paſs'd their Journey, till they came to the Cave the next Day, having lain the Night before in a conſiderable Village on the Road. There they brought a hundred Fathom of Cordage to hang Don <hi>Quixote</hi> by, and let him down to the loweſt part of the Cave; he being reſolv'd to go to the very Bottom, were it as deep as Hell. The Mouth of it was inacceſſible, being quite ſtopp'd up with Weeds, Buſhes, Brambles, and wild Fig-Trees, tho' the Entrance was wide and ſpacious. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was no ſooner come to the Place, but he prepar'd for his Expedition into that Under-World, telling the Scholar, that he was reſolv'd to reach the Bottom, tho' as deep as the profound Abyſs; and all having alighted, his Squire and his Guide accordingly girt him faſt with the Rope. While this was doing; good ſweet Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what you do. Don't venture into ſuch a curſed Black Hole! Look before ye Leap, Sir, and be not ſo wilful as to Bury your ſelf Alive. Don't hang your ſelf like a Bottle or a Bucket, that's let down to be ſous'd in a Well. Alack a day, Sir, 'tis none of your Buſineſs to pry thus into every Hole, and go down to the Pit of Hell for the nonce! Peace Coward, ſaid the Knight, and bind me faſt, for purely for me ſuch an Enterprize as this is reſerv'd. Pray Sir, ſaid the Student, when you are in, be very Vigilant in exploring and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving all the Rarities in the Place. Let nothing 'ſcape you Eyes, perhaps you may diſcover there ſome things worthy to be inſerted in my Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſis. Let him alone, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> he'll go thro' ſtich with it. He'll make a Hog or a Dog of it, I'll warrant you. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> being well
<pb n="835" facs="tcp:54446:453"/>
bound, not over his Armour, but his Doublet, bethought himſelf of one thing they had forgot. We did ill, ſaid he, not to provide our ſelves of a little Bell, that I ſhould have carried down with me, to Ring for more or leſs Rope as I may have occaſion for, and inform you of my being Alive. But ſince there is no Remedy, Heaven Proſper me. Then Kneeling down, he in a low Voice recommended himſelf to the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for Aſſiſtance and Succeſs in an Adventure ſo ſtrange, and in all appearance ſo Dangerous. Then raiſing his Voice, O thou Miſtreſs of my Life and Motions, cry'd he, moſt Illuſtrious and Peerleſs <hi>Dulcinea Del Toboſo,</hi> if the Prayers of an adventurous abſent Lover may reach the Ears of the far diſtant object of his Wiſhes, by the Power of thy unſpeakable Beauty, I conjure thee to grant me thy Favour and Protection, in this Plunge and Precipice of my Fortune. I am now going to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulph, and caſt my ſelf into this diſmal Profundity, that the World may know, nothing can be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to him, who influenc'd by thy Smiles, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts under the Banner of thy Beauty, the moſt difficult Tasks. This ſaid, he got up again, and approaching the Entrance of the Cave, he found it ſtopp'd up with Brakes and Buſhes, ſo that he muſt be oblig'd to make his Way by Force. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon drawing his Sword, he began to cut and ſlaſh the Weeds that ſtopp'd up the Mouth of the Cave, when preſently an infinite number of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown Crows and Daws came ruſhing and flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering out of the Cave about his Ears, ſo thick, and with ſuch an Impetuoſity, as over-whelm'd him to the Ground. He was not Superſtitious enough to draw any ill Omen from the Flight of the Birds; beſides, 'twas no ſmall Encouragement to him, that he ſpy'd no Batts nor Owls; nor other
<pb n="836" facs="tcp:54446:454"/>
ill-boding Birds of Night among them: He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore roſe again with an undaunted Heart, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited himſelf to the black and dreadful Abyſs. But <hi>Sancho</hi> firſt gave him his Benediction, and making a Thouſand Croſſes over him, Heaven be thy Guide, quoth he, and our<note n="*" place="margin">Several Places of Devotion.</note> Lady of the Rock in <hi>France,</hi> with the Trinity of <hi>Gaeta,</hi> thou Flower and Cream, and Scum of all Knight-Errants. Go thy Ways, thou Hacker of the World, Heart of Steel, and Arms of Braſs! And may'ſt thou come back Sound, Wind and Limb, out of this dreadful Hole, which thou art running into, once more to ſee the warm Sun, which thou art leaving.</p>
                        <p>The Scholar too Pray'd to the ſame Effect for the Knight's Happy Return. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> then call'd for more Rope, which they gave him by degrees, till his Voice was drown'd in the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Cave, and their Cordage was run out. That done, they began to conſider whether they ſhou'd hoiſt him up again immediately or no; however, they reſolv'd to ſtay half an Hour, and then they began to draw up the Rope, but were ſtrangely ſurpriz'd to find no Weight upon it; which made 'em conclude, the poor Gentleman was certainly loſt. <hi>Sancho</hi> burſting out into Tears, made a heavy Lamentation, and fell a haling up the Rope as faſt as he cou'd, to be thoroughly ſatisfy'd. But after they had drawn up about fourſcoure Fathoms, they felt a Weight again, which made 'em take Heart; and at length they plainly ſaw Don <hi>Quixote.</hi> Welcome, cry'd <hi>Sancho</hi> to him, as ſoon as he came in Sight, Welcome dear Maſter, I'm glad you're come again; we were afraid you had been Pawn'd for the Reckoning.
<pb n="837" facs="tcp:54446:454"/>
But <hi>Sancho</hi> had no Anſwer to his Compliment; and when they had pull'd the Knight quite up, they found that his Eyes were clos'd, as if he had been faſt aſleep. They laid him on the Ground, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound him: Yet he made no ſign of Waking, and all their turning and ſhaking was little enough to make him come to himſelf. At laſt he began to ſtretch his Limbs, as if he had waken'd out of the moſt profound Sleep, and ſtaring wildly about him, Heavens forgive you, Friends, cry'd he; for you have rais'd me now from one of the ſweeteſt Lives, that ever Mortal led, and moſt delightful Sights that ever Eyes beheld. Now I perceive how fleeting are all the Joys of this Tranſitory Life: They are but an imperfect Dream, they fade like a Flower, and vaniſh like a Shadow. Oh ill-fated <hi>Monteſinos!</hi> Oh <hi>Durandart</hi> unfortunately Wounded! Oh unhappy <hi>Belerma!</hi> Oh deplorable <hi>Guadiana!</hi> And you the diſtreſs'd Daughters of <hi>Ruydera,</hi> whoſe flowing Waters ſhew what ſtreams of Tears once trickl'd from your Lovely Eyes! Theſe Expreſſions, utter'd with great Paſſion and Concern, ſurpriz'd the Scholar and <hi>Sancho,</hi> and they deſir'd to know his Meaning, and what he had ſeen in that Hell upon Earth? Call it not Hell, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> for it deſerves a better Name, as I ſhall ſoon let you know. But firſt give me ſomething to Eat, for I am prodigiouſly hungry. They then ſpread the Scholar's courſe Saddle-Cloth for a Carpet; and Examining their old Cup-board, the Knap-ſack, they all three ſat down on the Graſs, and Eat heartily together, like Men that were a Meal or two behind-hand. When they had done, Let no Man ſtir, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> ſit ſtill, and hear me with Attention.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XXIII.</hi> Of the Wonderful things which the Unparalell'd Don <hi>Quixote</hi> declar'd he had ſeen in the deep Cave of <hi>Monteſinos,</hi> the Greatneſs and Impoſſibility of which makes this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture paſs for Apocryphal.</head>
                        <p>IT was now paſt four in the Afternoon, and the Sun was opportunely hid behind the Clouds, which, interpoſing between his Rays, invited Don <hi>Quixote</hi> without heat or trouble to relate to his Illuſtrious Auditors the Wonders he had ſeen in <hi>Monteſino</hi>'s Cave.</p>
                        <p>About twelve or fourteen Men's depth, ſaid he, in the profundity of this Cavern, on the right Hand, there is a Concavity wide enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a large Waggon, Mules and all. This place is not wholly dark, for thro' ſome chinks and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row holes, that reach to the diſtant ſurface of the Earth, there comes a glimmering Light. I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd this Receſs, being already weary of hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Loins, diſcourag'd by the profound Darkneſs of the Region below me, deſtitute of a Guide, and not knowing whither I went: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving therefore to reſt my ſelf there a while, I call'd to you to give me no more Rope, but it ſeems you did not hear me. I therefore enter'd, and coiling up the Cord, ſat upon it very melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick, and thinking what way I ſhou'd moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently get down to the Bottom, having no
<pb n="839" facs="tcp:54446:455"/>
body to bear me up. While thus I ſate penſive, and loſt in thought, inſenſibly without any previous Drowſineſs, I found my ſelf ſurpriz'd by Sleep; and after that, not knowing how, nor which way I waken'd, I unexpectedly found my ſelf in the fineſt, the ſweeteſt, and moſt delightful Meadow, that ever Nature adorn'd with her Beauties, or the moſt inventive Fancy cou'd ever imagine. Now, that I might be ſure this was neither a Dream nor an Illuſion, I rubb'd my Eyes, blow'd my Noſe, and felt ſeveral parts of my Body, and convinc'd my ſelf that I was really awake, with the uſe of all my Senſes, and all the Faculties of my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſound and active as at this Moment.</p>
                        <p>Preſently I diſcover'd a Royal and Sumptuous Palace, of which the Walls and Battlements ſeem'd all of clear and tranſparent Cryſtal. At the ſame time, the Spacious Gates opening, there came out towards me a venerable old Man, clad in a ſad-colour'd Robe, ſo long that it ſwept the Ground; on his Breaſt and Shoulders he had a Green-Sattin-Tippet after the manner of thoſe worn in Colleges. On his Head he wore a black <hi>Milan</hi>-Cap, and his broad hoary Beard reach'd down below his Middle. He had no kind of Weapon in his Hands, but a Roſary of Beads about the bigneſs of Walnuts, and his <hi>Credo</hi>-Beads appear'd as large as ordinary Oſtrich-Eggs. The Awful and Grave Aſpect, the Pace, the Port and goodly Preſence of this old Man, each of 'em apart, and much more all together, ſtruck me with veneration and aſtoniſhment. He came up to me, and without any previous Ceremony, embracing me cloſe: 'Tis a long time ſaid he, moſt Renown'd Knight, Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> that we who dwell in this inchanted Solitude have hop'd to ſee thee here; that thou may'ſt inform the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per World of the ſurprizing Prodigies conceal'd
<pb n="840" facs="tcp:54446:456"/>
from Humane Knowledge in this Subterranean Hollow, call'd the Cave of <hi>Monteſinos:</hi> An Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize reſerv'd alone for thy inſuperable Heart, and ſtupendous Reſolution. Go with me then, thou moſt Illuſtrious Knight, and behold the Wonders enclos'd within this tranſparent Caſtle, of which I am the perpetual Governour and chief Warden, being the ſame individual <hi>Monteſinos,</hi> from whom this Cavern took its Name.</p>
                        <p>No ſooner had the reverend old Man let me know who he was, but I entreated him to tell me, whether it was true or no, that at his Friend <hi>Durandarte</hi>'s Dying Requeſt he had taken out his Heart with a ſmall Dagger, the very moment he expir'd, and carry'd it to his Miſtreſs <hi>Belerma,</hi> as the Story was current in the World? 'Tis Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally true, anſwer'd the Old Gentleman, except that ſingle Circumſtance of the Dagger; for I us'd neither a ſmall nor a large Dagger on this occaſion, but a well poliſh'd Ponyard, as ſharp as an Awl. I'll be hang'd, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> if it was not one of your <hi>Sevil</hi> Ponyards, of <hi>Raymond de Hoze</hi>'s making. That can't be, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> for that Cutler lived but t'other Day, and the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel of <hi>Ronceſvalles,</hi> where this accident happen'd, was fought many Ages ago: But this is of no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to the Story. You are in the right, Sir, ſaid the Student, and pray go on, for I hearken to your Relation with the greateſt ſatisfacton im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginable. That, Sir, ſaid the Knight, encreaſes my Pleaſure in telling it. But to proceed: The Venerable <hi>Monteſinos</hi> having conducted me into the Cryſtal-Palace, led me into a ſpacious Ground-Room, exceeding cool, and all of Alabaſter. In the middle of it ſtood a ſtately Marble Tomb, that ſeem'd a Maſter-piece of Art; upon which lay a Knight extended all at length, not of Stone,
<pb n="841" facs="tcp:54446:456"/>
or Braſs, as on other Monuments, but pure Fleſh and Bones. He cover'd the Region of his Heart with his Right Hand, which ſeem'd to me ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what hairy, and very full of Sinews, a ſign of the great ſtrength of the Body to which it belong'd. <hi>Monteſinos</hi> obſerving that I view'd this Spectacle with ſurprize? Behold, ſaid he, the Flower and Mirrour of all the amorous and valiant Knights of his Age, my Friend <hi>Durandarte,</hi> who, together with me and many others of both Sexes, are kept here inchanted by <hi>Merlin</hi> that <hi>Britiſh</hi> Magician, who, they ſay, was the Son of the Devil; tho' I cannot believe it, only his knowledge was ſo great, that he might be ſaid to know more than the Devil. Here I ſay we are inchanted, but how and for what cauſe no Man can tell, tho' time I hope will ſhortly reveal it. But the moſt wonderful part of my Fortune is this, I am as certain, as that the Sun now ſhines, that <hi>Durandarte</hi> dy'd in my Arms, and that with theſe Hands I took out his Heart, by the ſame Token that it weigh'd above two Pounds, a ſure mark of his Courage; for, by the Rules of Natural Philoſophy, the moſt Valiant Men have ſtill the greateſt Hearts. Nevertheleſs, tho' this Knight really dy'd, he ſtill complains and ſighs ſometimes as if he were alive. Scarce had <hi>Monteſinos</hi> ſpoke theſe Words, but the miſerable <hi>Durandarte</hi> cry'd out aloud, Oh! Couſin <hi>Monteſinos,</hi> the laſt and dying Requeſt of your departing Friend was to take my Heart out of my Breaſt with a Ponyard or a Dagger, and carry it to <hi>Belerma.</hi> The Vener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Monteſinos</hi> hearing this, fell on his Knees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the afflicted Knight, and with Tears in his Eyes, Long, long ago, ſaid he, O <hi>Durandarte,</hi> thou deareſt of my Kinſmen, have I obey'd what you enjoyn'd me on that bitter fatal Day when you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir'd. I took out your Heart with all imaginable
<pb n="842" facs="tcp:54446:457"/>
Care not leaving the leaſt Particle of it in your Breaſt, I gently wip'd it with a Lac'd Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and poſted away with it to <hi>France,</hi> as ſoon as I had committed your dear Remains to the Boſom of the Earth, having ſhed Tears enough to have waſh'd my Hands clear of the Blood they had gather'd by plunging in your Entrails. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this Truth yet farther, at the firſt place where I ſtopp'd from <hi>Ronceſvalles,</hi> I laid a little Salt upon your Heart, to preſerve it from Putrefaction, and keep it, if not freſh, at leaſt free from any ill Smell, till I preſented it into the Hands of <hi>Belerma,</hi> who with you and me, and <hi>Guadiana</hi> your Squire, as alſo <hi>Ruydera</hi> (the Lady's Woman) with her ſeven Daughters, her two Nieces, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of your Friends and Acquaintance, is here confin'd by the Necromantick Charms of the Magician <hi>Merlin;</hi> and tho' it be now above five hundred Years ſince we were firſt convey'd to this Inchanted Caſtle, we are all ſtill alive, except <hi>Ruydera,</hi> her Daughters and Nieces, who by the favour of <hi>Merlin,</hi> that pity'd their Tears, were turn'd into ſo many Lakes, ſtill extant in the World of the Living, and in the Province of <hi>La-Mancha,</hi> diſtinguiſh'd by the Names of the Lakes of <hi>Ruydera;</hi> ſeven of 'em belonging to the Kings of <hi>Spain;</hi> and the two Nieces to the Knights of the moſt Holy Order of St. <hi>John.</hi> Your Squire <hi>Guadiana,</hi> lamenting his hard Fate, was in like manner Metamorphos'd into a River that bears his Name; yet ſtill ſo ſenſible of your Diſaſter, that when he firſt aroſe out of the Bowels of the Earth to flow along its ſurface, and ſaw the Sun in a ſtrange Hemiſphere, he plung'd again under Ground, ſtriving to hide his melting ſorrows from the World; but the natural Current of his Waters forcing a Paſſage up again, he is compell'd to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="843" facs="tcp:54446:457"/>
where the Sun and Mortals may ſee him. Thoſe Lakes mixing their Waters in his Boſom, he ſwells, and glides along in ſullen ſtate to <hi>Portugal,</hi> often expreſſing his deep Melancholy by the mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and turbid Colour of his Streams, which, as they refuſe to pleaſe the ſight, ſo likewiſe deny to indulge mortal Appetite, by breeding ſuch fair and ſavoury Fiſh as may be found in the Golden <hi>Tagus.</hi> All this I have often told you, my deareſt <hi>Duran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darte;</hi> and ſince you return me no Anſwer, I muſt conclude you believe me not, or that you do not hear me; for which (Witneſs it Heaven) I am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely griev'd. But now I have other News to tell ye, which, tho' perhaps it may not aſſwage your Sorrows, yet I am ſure it will not encreaſe 'em. Open your Eyes, and behold in your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence that mighty Knight, of whom <hi>Merlin</hi> the Sage has foretold ſo many Wonders: That Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> I mean, who has not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd to the World the Function of Knight-Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantry, that has lain ſo long in Oblivion, out ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd it to greater Fame than it cou'd boaſt in the Days of yore, the nonage of the World. 'Tis by his Power we may expect to ſee the fatal Charm diſolv'd, that keeps us here confin'd, for great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances are properly reſerv'd for great Perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages. And ſhou'd it not be ſo; anſwer'd the grieving <hi>Durandarte</hi> with a faint and languiſhing Voice, Shou'd it not be ſo, I ſay, Oh Couſin! Patience, and Shuffle the Cards— Then turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on one ſide, without ſpeaking a Word more, he relaps'd into his uſual ſilence. After this, I was alarm'd with a piteous howling and crying, which, mix'd with lamentable Sighs and Groans, oblig'd me to turn about, to ſee whence it proceeded. Then thro' the Cryſtal-Wall I ſaw a mournful Proceſſion of moſt Beautiful Damſels, all in black,
<pb n="844" facs="tcp:54446:458"/>
marching in two Ranks, with Turbans on their Heads after the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Faſhion; and laſt of all came a Majeſtick Lady, dreſs'd alſo in Mourning, with a long White Veil, that reach'd from her Head down to the Ground. Her Turban was twice as big as the biggeſt of the reſt: She was ſomewhat beetle-brow'd, her Noſe was flattiſh, her Mouth-wide, but her Lips Red; her Teeth, which ſhe ſometimes diſcover'd, ſeem'd to be thin and ſnaggy, but indeed as White as blanch'd Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds. She held a fine Handkerchief, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it I cou'd perceive a Heart of Fleſh, ſo dry and wither'd that it look'd like Mummy. <hi>Monteſinos</hi> inform'd me, that the Proceſſion conſiſted of <hi>Durandarte</hi>'s and <hi>Belerma</hi>'s Servants, who were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted there with their Maſter and Miſtreſs; but that the laſt was <hi>Belerma</hi> herſelf, who with her At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants us'd four Days in the Week conſtantly thus to ſing, or rather howl their Dirges over the Heart and Body of his Couſin; and that tho' <hi>Belerma</hi> appear'd a little haggard at that juncture, occaſion'd by the Grief ſhe bore in her own Heart, for that which ſhe carry'd in her Hand, yet had I ſeen her before her Misfortunes had ſunk her Eyes and tarniſh'd her Complexion, worſe than the Diſeaſes of her Sex, from which ſhe was free, I muſt have own'd, that even the celebrated <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo,</hi> ſo famous in <hi>La Mancha,</hi> and over the whole Univerſe, cou'd ſcarce have vy'd with her in Gracefulneſs and Beauty. Hold there, good Signior Don <hi>Monteſinos,</hi> ſaid I. You know that Compariſons are odious, therefore no more comparing, I beſeech you; but go on with your Story. The peerleſs <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo</hi> is what ſhe is, and the Lady <hi>Belerma</hi> is what ſhe is, and has been; ſo no more upon that Subject. I beg your Pardon, anſwer'd <hi>Monteſinos,</hi> Signior Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> I
<pb n="845" facs="tcp:54446:458"/>
might have gueſs'd indeed that you were the Lady <hi>Dulc nea</hi>'s Knight, and therefore I ought to have bit my Tongue off, ſooner than to have compar'd her to any thing lower than Heaven it ſelf. This ſatisfaction, which I thought ſufficient from the great <hi>Monteſinos,</hi> ſtifl'd the Reſentment I elſe had ſhewn for hearing my Miſtreſs compar'd to <hi>Belerma.</hi> Nay, marry, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I wonder you did not catch the old Doating Huncks by the Weaſond, and mawl, and threſh him thick and threefold. How cou'd you leave one Hair upon his Chin! No, no, <hi>Sancho</hi> anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a Reſpect due to our Seniors, tho' they be no Knights; but moſt when they are ſuch, and under the Oppreſſion of Inchantment. However, I am ſatisfy'd that in what Diſcourſe paſs'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, I took care not to have any thing that look'd like an Affront ſix'd upon me. But Sir, ask'd the Scholar, how cou'd you ſee and hear ſo many ſtrange things in ſo little Time? I can't conceive how you cou'd do it. How long, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> do you reckon that I have been in the Cave? A little above an Hour, anſwer'd <hi>Sancho.</hi> That's impoſſible, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> for I ſaw Morning and Evening, and Evening and Morning three times ſince; ſo that I cou'd not be abſent leſs than three Days from this upper World. Ay, ay, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> my Maſter's in the Right; for theſe Inchantments, that have the greateſt Hand in all his Concerns, may make that ſeem three Days and three Nights to him, which is but an Hour to other People. It muſt be ſo, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote.</hi> I hope, Sir, ſaid the Scholar, you have eaten ſomething in all that time. Not one morſel, reply'd Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> neither have I had the leaſt Deſire to Eat, or ſo much as thought of it all the while. Do they that are Inchanted ever Eat?

This makes good the ſaying, quoth <hi>Sancho, Tell me thy Company, and I'll tell thee what thou art.</hi> Troth! you have all been inchanted together. No wonder if you neither eat nor ſlept, ſince you were in the Land of thoſe that always watch and faſt. But Sir, wou'd you ha' me ſpeak as I think; and pray don't take it in ill part, for if I believe one Word of all you've ſaid.— What do you mean, Friend, ſaid the Student? Do you think the Noble Don <hi>Quixote</hi> wou'd be guilty of a Lie; and if he had a mind to ſtretch a little, cou'd he, think you, have had leiſure to frame ſuch a number of Stories in ſo ſhort a time? I don't think that my Maſter wou'd lie neither, ſaid <hi>Sancho.</hi> What d'ye think then Sir, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote?</hi> Why truly, Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I do believe that this ſame cunning Man' this <hi>Merlin,</hi> that bewitch'd, or Inchanted, as you call it, all that Rabble of People you talk of, may have cramm'd and inchanted ſome way or other all that you've told us, and have yet to tell us, into your Noddle. 'Tis not impoſſible but ſuch a thing may happen, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> tho' I'm convinc'd 'twas otherwiſe with me; for I am poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive that I ſaw with theſe Eyes, and felt with theſe Hands all I have mention'd. But what will you think when I tell you, among many wonderful things, that I ſaw three Country-Wenches leaping and skipping about thoſe pleaſant Fields like ſo many Wild Goats, and at firſt ſight knew one of
<pb n="847" facs="tcp:54446:459"/>
'em to be the Peerleſs <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> and the other two the very ſame we ſpoke to not far from <hi>Toboſo.</hi> I ask'd <hi>Monteſinos</hi> if he knew 'em? He anſwer'd in the Negative; but imagin'd them ſome Inchanted Ladies who were newly come, and that the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of ſtrange Faces was no rarity among 'em, for many of paſs'd Ages and the preſent were inchanted there, under ſeveral Diſguiſes; and that, among the reſt, he knew Queen <hi>Guine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> and her Woman <hi>Quintaniona,</hi> that officiated as Sir <hi>Lancelot</hi>'s Cup-bearer, as he came from <hi>Britain. Sancho,</hi> hearing his Maſter talk at that Rate, had like to have forgot himſelf, and burſt out a laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for he well knew that <hi>Dulcinea</hi>'s Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was a Lye, and that he himſelf was the chief Magician, and raiſer of the Story; and thence concluding his Maſter ſtark-mad, In an ill hour, quoth he, dear Maſter of mine, and in a woeful Day went your Worſhip down to the other World, and in a worſe hour met you with that plaguy <hi>Monteſinos,</hi> that has ſent you back in this rueful Pickle. You went hence in your right Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, cou'd talk prettily enough now and then, had your handſome Proverbs and Wiſe Sayings every Foot, and wou'd give wholſome Counſel to all that would take it; but now, bleſs me! you talk as if you had left your Brains in the Devil's Cellar. I know thee, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and therefore I regard thy Words as little as I ought. And I yours reply'd <hi>Sancho.</hi> Nay, you may cripple, lame, or kill me if you pleaſe, either for what I've ſaid, or mean to ſay: I muſt ſpeak my Mind tho' I die for't. But before your Blood's up, pray, Sir, tell me, how did you know it was your Miſtreſs? Did you ſpeak to her? What did ſhe ſay to you? And what did you ſay to her? I knew her again, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> by the ſame
<pb n="848" facs="tcp:54446:460"/>
Cloaths ſhe wore when thou ſhewd'ſt her to me. I ſpoke to her, but ſhe made no Anſwer, but ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly turn'd away, and fled from me like a Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind. I intended to have follow'd her, had not <hi>Monteſinos</hi> told me 'twou'd be to no purpoſe; warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me beſides, that 'twas high time to return to the upper Air. And changing the Diſcourſe, he told me that I ſhou'd hereafter be made acquainted with the means of diſinchanting them all. But while <hi>Monteſinos</hi> and I were thus talking together, a very odd Accident, the Thoughts of which trouble me ſtill, broke off our Converſation. For as we were in the height of our Diſcourſe, who ſhou'd come to me but one of the unfortunate <hi>Dulcinea</hi>'s Companions, and before I was aware, with a faint and doleful Voice, Sir, ſaid ſhe, my Lady <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo</hi> gives her Service to you, and deſires to know how you do, and being a little ſhort of Money at preſent, ſhe deſires you of all love and kindneſs to lend her ſix Reals upon this New Fuſtian-Petticoat, or more or leſs as you can ſpare it, Sir, and ſhe'll take care to redeem it very honeſtly in a little time. The Meſſage ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd me ſtrangely, and therefore turning to <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſinos,</hi> Is it poſſible, Sir, ſaid I, that Perſons of Quality, when inchanted, are in want? Oh! very poſſible, Sir, ſaid he: Poverty ranges every where, and ſpares neither Quality inchanted nor unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted; and therefore, ſince the Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi> deſires you to lend her theſe ſix Reals, and the Pawn is a good Pawn, let her have the Money; for ſure 'tis very low with her at this time. I ſcorn to take Pawns, ſaid I, but my misfortune is, that I can't anſwer the full Requeſt; for I have but four Reals about me, and that was the Money thou gaveſt me the t'other Day, <hi>Sancho,</hi> to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute among the Poor. However, I gave her all
<pb n="849" facs="tcp:54446:460"/>
I had, and deſir'd her to tell her Miſtreſs, I was very ſorry for her wants; and that if I had all the Treaſures which <hi>Croeſus</hi> poſſeſs'd, they ſhou'd be at her Service; and withal, that I dy'd every hour for want of her reviving Company; and made it my humble and earneſt Requeſt, that ſhe wou'd vouchſafe to ſee and converſe with her Captive Servant, and weather-beaten Knight. Tell her, continu'd I, when ſhe leaſt expects it, ſhe will come to hear how I have made an Oath, as the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Mantua</hi> did when he found his Nephew <hi>Baldwin</hi> ready to expire on the Mountain, never to eat upon a Table-cloath, and ſeveral other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars which he ſwore to obſerve, till he had reveng'd his Death. So in the like ſolemn manner will I Swear, never to deſiſt from traverſing the habitable Globe, and ranging thro' all the ſeven Parts of the World, more indefatigably than ever was done by Prince <hi>Pedro</hi> of <hi>Portugal,</hi> till I have freed her from her Inchantment. All this and more you owe my Miſtreſs ſaid the Damſel; and then, having got the four Reals, inſtead of drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping me a Curtſie, ſhe cut me a Caper in the Air two yards high. Now Heaven defend us, cry'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> who cou'd ever have believ'd that theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh Inchanters and Inchantments ſhou'd have ſo much power in this World, as to bewitch my Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at that rate, and craze his ſound Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that manner. Alas! Sir, for Heaven's ſake take care of your ſelf. What will the World ſay of you? Rouſe up your dozing Senſes, and don't doat upon thoſe Whimſies, that have ſo wickedly crack'd that rare Head-piece of yours. Well, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> I cannot be angry at thy ignorant Tittle-tattle, becauſe it proceeds from thy Love towards me. Thou think'ſt, poor Fellow, that whatever is beyond the Sphere of thy Narrow
<pb n="850" facs="tcp:54446:461"/>
Comprehenſion muſt be impoſſible: But, as I have already ſaid, there will come a time, when I ſhall give thee an account of ſome Things I have ſeen below, that will convince thee of the Reality of thoſe I told thee now, the Truth of which admits of no Diſpute.</p>

                        <p>THE Tranſlator of this great Hiſtory, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that at the beginning of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which Treats of the Adventure of <hi>Monteſinos</hi>'s Cave, he found a Marginal Annotation, written with the <hi>Arabian</hi> Author's own Hand, in theſe Words.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>I cannot be perſwaded, nor believe, that all the wonderful Accidents ſaid to have happen'd to the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous Don</hi> Quixote <hi>in the Cave, ſo punctually befell him as he relates 'em: For, the Courſe of his Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures hitherto has been very Natural, and bore the Face of Probability; but in this there appears no Coherence with Reaſon, and nothing but monſtrous Incongruities. But on the other Hand, if we conſider the Honour, Worth, and Integrity of the Noble Don</hi> Quixote, <hi>we have not the leaſt reaſon to ſuſpect he would be guilty of a Lye; but rather that he would ſooner have been Transfix'd with Arrows. Beſides, he has been ſo particular in his Relation of that Adventure, and given ſo many Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, that I dare not declare it abſolutely Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal;
<pb n="851" facs="tcp:54446:461"/>
eſpecially when I conſider that he had not time enough to invent ſuch a Cluſter of Fables. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inſert it among the reſt, without offering to Determine whether it is true or falſe; leaving it to the Diſcretion of the Judicious Reader. Tho' I muſt acquaint him by the way, that Don</hi> Quixote <hi>upon his Death-Bed utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſown'd this Adventure, as a perfect Fable, which he ſaid he had invented purely to pleaſe his Humour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuitable to ſuch as he had formerly read in Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances: And ſo much by way of Digreſſion.</hi>

Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he wou'd have though this not checking <hi>Sancho</hi> a greater ſign of Madneſs than his Diſcourſe. Noble Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> ſaid he, for four principal Reaſons, I am extremely pleas'd with having taken this Journey with you. Firſt, it has procur'd me the Honour of your Acquaintance, which I ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways eſteem a ſingular Happineſs. In the ſecond Place, Sir, the Secrets of <hi>Monteſinos</hi>'s Cave, and the Transformations of <hi>Guadiana,</hi> and <hi>Ruydera</hi>'s Lakes, have been reveal'd to me, which may look very great in my <hi>Spaniſh Ovid.</hi> My third Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage is, to have diſcover'd the Antiquity of Card-playing, which I find to have been a Paſtime in uſe even in the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Great's time, as may be Collected from the Words of <hi>Durandarte,</hi> who, after a long Speech of <hi>Monteſinos</hi>'s, ſaid as he wak'd, <hi>Patience and ſhuffle the Cards;</hi> which vulgar Expreſſion he could never have learn'd in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment: It follows therefore that he muſt have heard it when he liv'd in <hi>France,</hi> which was in the
<pb n="852" facs="tcp:54446:462"/>
Reign of that Emperor; which Obſervation is nick'd, I think, very opportunely for my Supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>Polydore Virgil,</hi> who, as I remember, has not touch'd upon Card-playing: I will inſert it into my Work, I'll aſſure you, Sir, as a matter of great Importance, having the Teſtimony of ſo Authentick and Ancient an Author as Sir <hi>Duran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darte.</hi> The fourth part of my good Fortune, is to know the certain and true ſource of the River <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana,</hi> which has hitherto diſappointed all Humane Enquiries. There is a great deal of Reaſon in what you ſay, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote:</hi> But, under favour, Sir, pray tell me, ſhould you happen to get a Licence to Publiſh your Books, which I ſomewhat doubt, whom will you pitch upon for your Patrons? Oh, Sir, anſwer'd the Author, there are Lords and Grandees enough in <hi>Spain,</hi> ſure, that I may Dedicate to. Truly, not many, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> there are indeed, ſeveral whoſe Merits deſerve the Praiſe of a Dedication, but very few whoſe Purſes will reward the Pains and Civility of the Author. I muſt confeſs, I know a Prince whoſe Generoſity may make amends for what is wanting in the reſt; and that to ſuch a Degree, that ſhould I make bold to come to Particulars, and ſpeak of his great Merits, 'twould be enough to ſtir up a noble Emulation in above four gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Breaſts. But more of this ſome other time; 'tis late now, and therefore convenient to think of a Lodging. Hard by us here, Sir, ſaid the Author, is an Hermitage, the Retirement of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Perſon, who, as they ſay, was once a Soldier, and is look'd upon as a good Chriſtian, and ſo charitable, that he has built there a little Houſe at his own expence, purely for the Entertainment of Strangers. But does he keep Hens there trow! ask'd <hi>Sancho?</hi> Few Hermits in this Age want
<pb n="853" facs="tcp:54446:462"/>
'em, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> for their way of Living now falls ſhort of the Strictneſs and Auſterity of thoſe in the Deſarts of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who went Clad only with Palm-leaves, and fed on the Roots of the Earth. Now, becauſe I ſpeak well of thoſe of old, I would not have you think I reflect on the others. No, I only mean that their Penances are not ſo ſevere as in former Days; yet this does not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der but that the Hermits of the preſent Age may be good Men. I look upon 'em to be ſuch; at leaſt, their Diſſimulation ſecures 'em from Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal; and the Hypocrite that puts on the Form of Holineſs, does certainly leſs harm than the bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd Sinner. As they went on in their Diſcourſe, they ſaw a Man following them a great pace on Foot, and ſwitching up a Mule laden with Lances and Halbards. He preſently overtook 'em, gave 'em the time of the Day, and paſs'd by. Stay, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Fellow, cry'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> ſeeing him go ſo faſt, make no more haſte than is conſiſtent with good ſpeed. I can't ſtay, Sir, ſaid the Man, for theſe Weapons that you ſee, muſt be us'd to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Morning; ſo, Sir, I am in haſte; good b'y. I ſhall Lodge to Night at the Inn beyond the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage; if you chance to go that way, there you may find me, and I'll tell you ſtrange News. So fare ye well. Then whipping his Mule, away he mov'd forwards, ſo faſt that Don <hi>Quixote</hi> had not Leiſure to ask him any more Queſtions. The Knight, who had always an Itching Ear after No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties, to ſatisfie his Curioſity immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd their holding ſtraight on to the Inn, without ſtopping at the Hermitage, where the Scholar de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to have ſtay'd all Night. Well, they all conſented, and made the beſt of their Way; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, when they came near the Hermitage, the Scholar deſir'd Don <hi>Quixote</hi> to call with him for a
<pb n="854" facs="tcp:54446:463"/>
Moment, and drink a Glaſs of Wine at the Door. <hi>Sancho</hi> no ſooner heard this propos'd, but he turn'd <hi>Dapple</hi> that way, and rode thither before; but to his great Grief, the hoſpitable Hermit was abroad, and no body at home but the Hermit's Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who being ask'd whether he had any ſtrong Liquor within, made anſwer, that he cou'd not come at any, but as for ſmall Water he might have his Belly-full. Body of me! quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> were mine a Water-Thirſt, or had I liking to your cold Comfort, there are Wells enough upon the Road, where I might have ſwill'd my Skin full: Oh the good Cheer at Don <hi>Diego</hi>'s Houſe, and the ſavory Scum at <hi>Camacho</hi>'s Wedding, when ſhall I find your Fellow! They now ſpurr'd on towards the Inn, and ſoon overtook on the Road a young Fellow beating it on the Hoof pretty leiſurely. He carry'd his Sword over his Shoulder, with a Bundle of Cloaths hanging upon it, which, to all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Appearance conſiſted of a pair of Breeches, a Cloak, and a Shirt or two. He had on a tatter'd Velvet-Jerkin, with a ragged Sattin-Lining; his Shirt hung out, his Stockings were of Silk, and his Shooes ſquare at the Toes, after the Court-Faſhion. He ſeem'd about Eighteen or Nineteen Years of Age, a good pleaſant-look'd Lad, and of a lively and active Diſpoſition. To paſs the Fatigue of his Journey the beſt he cou'd, he Sung all the way, and as they came near him, was got to the end of a Ballad, which the Scholar got by Heart.</p>

                           <pb n="855" facs="tcp:54446:463"/>So, young Gentleman, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote</hi> to him, methinks you go very light and airy. Whither are you bound, I pray you, if a Man may be ſo bold? I'm going to the Wars, Sir, anſwe'r'd the Youth; and for my Travelling thus, Heat and Poverty will excuſe it. I admit the Heat, reply'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> but why Poverty, I beſeech you? Becauſe I have no Cloaths to put on, reply'd the Lad, but what I carry in this Bundle; and if I ſhou'd wear 'em out upon the Road, I ſhou'd have nothing to make a handſome Figure with in any Town; for I have no Money to buy new ones, till I overtake a Regiment of Foot that lies about ſome twelve Leagues off, where I deſign to Liſt my ſelf, and then I ſhall not want a Conveniency to ride with the Baggage till we come to <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gena,</hi> where, I here they are to Embark; for I had rather ſerve the King abroad, than any beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly Courtier at home. But pray, ſaid the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, have not you laid up ſomething while you were there? Had I ſerv'd any of your Grandees or great Perſons, ſaid the young Man, I might have done well enough, and have had a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by this time; for their Foot-boys are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently advanc'd to Captains and Lieutenants, or ſome other good Poſt: But a Plague on't, Sir, 'twas always my ill Fortune to ſerve pitiful Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarts and Younger Brothers, and my Allowance was commonly ſo ill paid, and ſo ſmall, that the better half was ſcarce enough to waſh my Linnen; how then ſhould a poor Devil of a Page, who would make his Fortune, come to any good in ſuch a miſerable Service! But, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> how comes it about that in all this time you could not get your ſelf a whole Livery? Alack-a-day, Sir, anſwer'd the Lad, I had a couple; but my Maſters dealt with me as they do with Novices in
<pb n="856" facs="tcp:54446:464"/>
Monaſteries, if they go off before they Profeſs, the freſh Habit is taken from them, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn them their old Cloaths. For you muſt know, that ſuch as I ſerv'd, only buy Liveries for a little Oſtentation; ſo when they have made their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance at Court, they ſneak down into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and then the poor Servants are ſtripp'd, and muſt e'en betake themſelves to their Rags again. A ſordid Trick, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> or, as the <hi>Italians</hi> call it, a notorious <hi>Eſpilocheria.</hi> Well, you need not repine at leaving the Court, ſince you do it with ſo good a Deſign; for there's nothing in the World more commendable than to ſerve God in the firſt Place, and the King in the next, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the Profeſſion of Arms, which if it does not procure a Man ſo much Riches as Learning, may at leaſt intitle him to more Honour. 'Tis true, that more Families have been advanc'd by the Gown; but yet your Gentlemen of the Sword, whatever the Reaſon of it is, have always I know not what Advantage above the Men of Learning, and ſomething of Glory and Splendour attends 'em, that makes them outſhine the reſt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. But take my Advice along with you, Child; if you intend to raiſe your ſelf by a Military Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, I would not have you be uneaſie with the Thoughts of what Misfortunes may befall you; the worſt can be but to Die, and if it be a good Honourable Death, your Fortune's made; and you're certainly happy. <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> that Valiant <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor, being ask'd what kind of Death was beſt? That which is ſudden and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected, ſaid he; and tho' his Anſwer had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh of Paganiſm, yet with reſpect to Humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, 'twas very Judicious: for, ſuppoſe you ſhould be cut off at the very firſt Engagement by a Canon-Ball, or the ſpringing of a Mine; what
<pb n="857" facs="tcp:54446:464"/>
imports it? 'Tis all but Dying, and there's an end of the Buſineſs. As <hi>Terence</hi> ſays, a Soldier makes a better Figure Dead in the Field of Battle, than A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live and ſafe in Flight. The more likely he is to riſe in Fame and Preferment, the better Diſcipline he keeps; the better he Obeys, the better he will know how to Command. And pray obſerve, my Friend, that 'tis more Honourable for a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier to ſmell of Gun-powder than of Musk and Amber; or if Old Age overtakes you in this noble Employment, though all over Scars, tho' Maim'd and Lame, you will ſtill have Honour to ſupport you, and ſecure you from the Contempt of Poverty; nay, from Poverty it ſelf; for there is Care taken, that Veteran and diſabled Soldiers may not want: Neither are they to be us'd as ſome Men do their Negro-Slaves, who, when they are Old, and paſt Service, are turn'd Naked out of Doors, under pretence of Freedom, to be made greater Slaves in Cold and Hunger, a Slavery from which nothing but Death can ſet the Wretches free. But I'll ſay no more to you on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject at this time. Get up behind me, and I'll carry you to the Inn, where you ſhall Sup with me, and to morrow Morning make the beſt of your way; and may Heaven Proſper your good Deſigns.</p>
                        <p>The Page excus'd himſelf from riding behind the Knight, but accepted of his Invitation to Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per very willingly. <hi>Sancho,</hi> who had all the while given Ear to his Maſter's Diſcourſe, is ſaid to have been more than uſually ſurpriz'd, hearing him now talk ſo wiſely. Now Bleſſing on thee, Maſter of mine, thought he to himſelf; how comes it about that a Man who ſays ſo many good things, ſhould tell ſuch damn'd Cracks, and Whimſies, as he would have us believe of <hi>Monteſinos</hi>'s Cave.
<pb n="858" facs="tcp:54446:465"/>
Well, Heaven knows beſt, and the Proof of the Pudding's in the Eating. By this time, it began to grow Dark, and they arriv'd at the Inn, where Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> alighting, ask'd preſently for the Man with the Lances and Halbards. The Inn-keeper anſwer'd, that he was rubbing down his Mule in the Stable. <hi>Sancho</hi> was very well pleas'd to be at his Journey's End, and the more that his Maſter took the Houſe for a real Inn, and not for a Caſtle, as he us'd to do. He and the Scholar then ſet up the Aſſes, giving <hi>Rozinante</hi> the beſt Manger and Standing in the Stable.</p>

                        <p>DON <hi>Quixote</hi> was on Thorns to know the ſtrange Story that the Fellow upon the Road engag'd to tell him; ſo that going into the Stable he minded him of his Promiſe, and preſs'd him to relate the whole matter to him that Moment. My Story will take up ſome time, quoth the Man, and is not to be told ſtanding; have a little Patience, Maſter of mine, let me make an end of ſerving my Mule, then I'll ſerve your Worſhip, and tell you ſuch things as will make you ſtare. Don't let that hinder, reply'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> for I'll help you my ſelf; and ſo ſaying,
<pb n="859" facs="tcp:54446:465"/>
he lent him a helping Hand, cleanſing the Manger, and ſifting the Barley, which humble complyance oblig'd the Fellow to tell his Tale the more will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly: So that ſeating himſelf upon a Bench with Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> the Scholar, the Page, <hi>Sancho,</hi> and the Inn-keeper about him for his full Auditory, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in this manner.</p>
                        <p>It happen'd on a time, that in a Borough about ſome four Leagues and a half from this place, one of the<note n="*" place="bottom">Regidor.</note> Aldermen loſt his Aſs: They ſay 'twas by the Roguery of a waggiſh Jade that was his Maid; but that's neither here nor there, the Aſs was loſt and gone, that's certain; and what's more, it could not be found neither high nor low. This ſame Aſs had been miſſing about a fortnight, Some ſay more, ſome leſs, when another Alderman of the ſame Town meeting this ſame loſing Alderman in the Market-place, Brother, quoth he, pay me well, and I'll tell you news of your Aſs. Troth! quoth the other, that I will; but then let me know where the poor Beaſt is? Why, anſwer'd t'other, this Morning what ſhould I meet upon the Mountains yonder but he, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either Pack-Saddle or Furniture, and ſo lean that it griev'd my Heart to ſee him; but yet ſo wild and skittiſh, that when I would have driven him home before me, he ran away as the Devil were in him, and got into the thickeſt of the Wood. Now if you pleaſe, we'll both go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and look for him; I'll but ſtep home firſt and put up this Aſs, then I'll come back to you, and we'll about it out of hand. Truly, Brother, ſaid the other, I'm mightily beholden to you, and will do as much for you another time. The
<pb n="860" facs="tcp:54446:466"/>
Story happen'd neither more nor leſs, but ſuch as I tell you, for ſo all that know it relate it word for word. In ſhort, the two Aldermen hand in hand, a foot, trudg'd up the Hills, and hunted up and down; but after many a weary Step, no Aſs was to be found. Upon which, quoth the Alderman that had ſeen him to t'other, hark you me, Brother, I have a Device in my Noddle to find out this ſame Aſs of yours, though he were under Ground, as you ſhall hear. You muſt know I can Bray to Admiration, and if you can but Bray never ſo little, the Job's done. Never ſo little, cry'd t'other, Body of me! I won't vail my Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anet at Braying to e'er an Aſs or Alderman in the Land. Well, we ſhall try that, quoth the other; for my Contrivance is that you ſhall go on one ſide of the Hill, and I on the other; ſometimes you ſhall Bray, and ſometimes I; ſo that, if your Aſs be but thereabouts, my Life for yours, he'll be ſure to anſwer his Kind, and Bray again. Gra'mercy, Brother, quoth the other! A rare Device, i'fack! let you alone for Plotting. At the ſame time they parted according to agreement, and when they were far enough off, they both fell a Braying ſo perfectly well, that they cheated one another; and meeting, each in hopes to find the Aſs, is it poſſible, Brother, ſaid the owner of the Aſs, that it was not my Aſs that Bray'd? No, marry, that it was n't, 'twas I, anſwer'd the other Alderman. Well, Brother, cry'd the Owner, then there's no manner of difference between you and an Aſs, as to matter of Braying, I never heard any thing ſo natural in my Life. Oh fye! Sir, quoth the other, I am nothing to you: You ſhall lay two to one againſt the beſt Brayer in the Kingdom, and I'll go your halves. Your Voice is lofty, and of a great Compaſs; you keep excellent Time, and
<pb n="861" facs="tcp:54446:466"/>
hold out a Note rarely, and your Cadence is full and Raviſhing. In ſhort, Sir, I knock under the Table, and yield you the Bays: Well then, Brother, anſwer'd the Owner, I ſhall always have the better Opinion of my ſelf for this one good Quality; for though I knew I Bray'd pretty well, I never thought my ſelf ſo great a Maſter before: Well, quoth the other, thus you ſee what rare Parts may be loſt for want of being known, and a Man never knows his own Strength, till he puts it to a Tryal. Right, Brother, quoth the Owner, for I ſhould never have found out this wonderful Gift of mine, had it not been for this buſineſs in hand, and may we ſpeed in't I pray? After theſe Compliments they parted again, and went Braying, this a'one ſide of the Hill, and that on t'other. But all to no purpoſe, for they ſtill deceiv'd one another with their Braying, and running to the noiſe, met one another as before.</p>
                        <p>At laſt they agreed to Bray twice together, that by that token they might be ſure 'twas not the Aſs, but they, that Bray'd. But all in vain, they almoſt Bray'd their Hearts out, but no anſwer from the Aſs. And indeed how could it, poor Creature? when they found him at laſt in the Wood half eaten by the Wolves. Alack-a day poor <hi>Grizzle,</hi> cry'd the Owner, I don't wonder now he took ſo little notice of his loving Maſter! Had he been alive, as ſure as he was an Aſs he would have Bray'd again. But let him go, this Comfort I have at leaſt, Brother; though I've loſt him, I've found out that rare Talent of yours, that has hugely ſolac'd me under this Affliction. The Glaſs is in a good Hand, Mr. Alderman, quoth the other, and if the Abbot ſings well, the young Monk is not much behind him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="862" facs="tcp:54446:467"/>With this, theſe ſame Aldermen, very much down i'th' Mouth, and very hoarſe, went home and told all their Neighbours the whole Story word for word; one praiſing t'other's Skill in Braying, and t'other returning the Compliment. In ſhort, one got it by the end, and t'other got it by the end; the Boys got it, and all the idle Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows got it, and there was ſuch a Brawling, and ſuch a Braying in our Town, that one would have thought Hell broke looſe among us. But to let you ſee now how the Devil never lies dead in a Ditch, but catches at every fooliſh thing to ſet People by the Ears; our Neighbouring Towns had it up, and when they ſaw any of our Towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folks, they fell a Braying, hitting us in the Teeth with the Braying of our Aldermen. This made ill Blood between us; for we took it in mighty Dudgeon, as well we might, and came to Words upon't, and from Words to Blows; for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our Town are as well known by this, as the Beggar knows his Diſh, and are apt to be jeer'd whereſoever they go; and then to't they go ding dong, hand over head, in ſpight of Law or Goſpel. And they've carry'd the Jeſt ſo far, that I believe to morrow or next day, the Men of our Town, to wit, the Brayers, will be in the Field againſt thoſe of another Town about two Leagues off, that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways plaguing us. Now, that we ſhould be well provided, I have brought theſe Lances and Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards that ye ſaw me carry. So this is my Story, Gentlefolks, and if it ben't a ſtrange one I'm woundily miſtaken.</p>
                        <p>Here the honeſt Man ended; when preſently enters a Fellow dreſs'd in Trouſſes and Doublet all of Shamoy-Leather, and calling out, as if he were ſome-body. Landlord, cry'd he, have you any Lodgings? For here comes the Fortune-tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="863" facs="tcp:54446:467"/>
Ape, and the Puppet-ſhew of <hi>Meliſandra</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance. Body of me! cry'd the Inkeeper, who's here? Maſter <hi>Peter,</hi> we ſhall have a merry Nigh't, Faith! Honeſt Maſter <hi>Peter,</hi> you're welcome with all my Heart! But where's the Ape, and the Show, that I can't ſee 'em. They'll be here preſently, ſaid <hi>Peter,</hi> I only came before to ſee if you had any Lodgings. Lodging, Man, ſaid the Inn-keeper, Zookers! I would turn out the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, rather than Maſter <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould want room. Come, come, bring in your things, for here are Gueſts in the Houſe to Night that will be good Cuſtomers to you, I warrant you. That's a good hearing, ſaid <hi>Peter;</hi> and to encourage 'em I'll lower my Prizes, and if I can but get my Charges to night, I'll look for no more; ſo I will haſten forward the Cart. This ſaid, he ran out of the Door again.</p>
                        <p>I had forgot to tell you, that this ſame Maſter <hi>Peter</hi> wore over his left Eye and half his Cheeck a Patch of Green Taffata, by which 'twas to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd that ſomething ail'd that ſide of his Face. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> enquir'd who this Maſter <hi>Peter</hi> was, and what his Ape and his Show? Why Sir, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd the Inn-keeper, he has ſtrolled about the Country here this great while with a curious Pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet-ſhow, which repreſents the Play of <hi>Meliſandra</hi> and Don <hi>Gayferos,</hi> one of the beſt Shows that has been Acted time out of mind in this Kingdom. Then he has an Ape! Bleſs us, Sir, 'tis ſuch an Ape! But I'll ſay no more; you ſhall ſee, Sir: 'Twill tell you every thing you ever did in your Life. The like was never ſeen before. Ask him a Queſtion, 'twill liſten to you and then, whip, up it leaps on its Maſter's Shoulder, and whiſpers firſt in his Ear what it knows, and then Maſter <hi>Peter</hi> tells you. He tells you what's to come, as well as
<pb n="864" facs="tcp:54446:468"/>
what is paſs'd; 'tis true, he does not always hit ſo pat as to what's to come; but after all, he's ſeldom in the wrong; which makes us apt to think, the Devil helps him at a dead lift. Two Reals is the price for every Queſtion he anſwers, or his Maſter for him, which is all one, you know; and that will mount to Money at the Year's end, ſo that 'tis thought the Rogue is well to paſs; and indeed much good may't do him, for he's a notable Fellow, and a boon Companion, and leads the merrieſt life in the World, talks for ſix Men, and drinks for a dozen, and all this he gets by his Tongue, his Ape, and his Show.</p>
                        <p>By this time, Maſter <hi>Peter</hi> came back with his Puppet-Show and his Ape in a Cart. The Ape was pretty luſty, without any Tail, and his But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks bare like a Felt. Yet he was hot very ugly neither. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> no ſooner ſaw him, but coming up to him, Mr. Fortune-teller, ſaid he, will you be pleas'd to tell us what Fiſh we catch, and what will become of us, and here's your Fee? ſaying this, he order'd <hi>Sancho</hi> to deliver Mr. <hi>Peter</hi> two Reals. Sir, anſwer'd <hi>Peter,</hi> this Animal gives no Account of Things to come; he knows ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing indeed of matters paſt, and a little of the preſent Odds bobs! quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I would not give a braſs Jack to know what's paſt; for who knows that better than my ſelf? I'm not ſo Fooliſh as to pay for what I know already: But ſince you ſay he has ſuch a knack at gueſſing the preſent, let good-man Ape tell me what my Wife <hi>Tereſa</hi> is doing, and what ſhe's about, and here's my two Reals. I'll have nothing of you before-hand ſaid Maſter <hi>Peter;</hi> ſo clapping himſelf on his left Shoulder, up skipp'd the Ape thither at one frisk, and laying his Mouth to his Ear grated his Teeth, and having made Apiſh Grimaces and a chattering noiſe for a
<pb n="865" facs="tcp:54446:468"/>
minute or two, with another skip down he leap'd on the Ground. Immediately upon this, Maſter <hi>Peter</hi> ran to Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and fell on his Knees, and embracing his Legs, Oh glorious Reſtorer of Knight-Errantry, cry'd he, I embrace theſe Legs, as I would the Pillars of <hi>Hercules.</hi> Who can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently extoll the great Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> the reviver of drooping Hearts, the Prop and Stay of the Falling, the Raiſer of the Fallen, and the Staff of Comfort to the Weak and Afflicted! At theſe Words Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ſtood amaz'd, <hi>Sancho,</hi> quak'd, the Page wonder'd, the Brayer bleſs'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the Inn-keeper ſtar'd, and the Scholar was in a brown Study, all aſtoniſh'd at Maſter <hi>Peter</hi>'s Speech; who then turning to <hi>Sancho,</hi> And thou, honeſt <hi>Sancho Pança,</hi> ſaid he, the beſt Squire to the beſt Knight in the World, bleſs thy kind Stars; for thy good Spouſe <hi>Tereſa</hi> is a good Houſe-wife, and is at this inſtant dreſſing a pound of Flax; by the ſame token, ſhe has ſtanding by her, on her left hand, a large broken-mouth Jug, which holds a pretty ſcantling of Wine, to cheer up her Spirits.</p>
                        <p>By yea and nay, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that's likely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, for ſhe's a true Soul, and a jolly Soul, and were it not for a Spice of Jealouſy that ſhe has now and then, I would not change her for the Gianteſs <hi>Andondona</hi> herſelf, who as my Maſter ſays, was as clever a piece of Woman's-Fleſh as ever went upon two Legs. Well, much good may't do thee, honeſt <hi>Tereſa;</hi> you are reſolv'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for one, I find, though your Heirs ſtarve for it. Well! ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> great is the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge procur'd by Reading, Travel and Experience! What on Earth but the Teſtimony of my own Eyes could have perſwaded me that Apes had the Gift of Divination! I am indeed the ſame Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha</hi> mention'd by this ingenious
<pb n="866" facs="tcp:54446:469"/>
Animal! though I muſt confeſs ſomewhat unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of ſo great a Character as it has pleas'd him to beſtow on me: But nevertheleſs I am not ſorry to have Charity and Compaſſion bear ſo great a Part in my Commendation, ſince my Nature has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways diſpos'd me to do good to all Men, and hurt to none.</p>
                        <p>Now had I but Money, ſaid the Page, I would know of Mr. Ape what Luck I ſhall have in the Wars. I have told you already, (ſaid Maſter <hi>Peter,</hi> who was got up from before Don <hi>Quixote)</hi> that this Ape does not meddle with what is to come, but if he could, it ſhould coſt you nothing, for Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s ſake, whom to oblige I would Sacrifice all the Intereſt I have in the World; and as a Mark of it, Gentlemen, I freely ſet up my Show, and give all the Company in the Houſe ſome Diverſion <hi>gratis.</hi> The Inn-keeper hearing this, was overjoy'd, and order'd Maſter <hi>Peter</hi> a convenient Room to ſet up his Motion, and he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately went about it.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time, Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> who could not bring himſelf to believe that an Ape could do all this, taking <hi>Sancho</hi> to a Corner of the Stable, Look ye, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid he, I have been weighing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the wonderful Gifts of this Ape, and find, in ſhort, Maſter <hi>Peter</hi> muſt have made a ſecret compact with the Devil. Nay, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> (miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding the word <hi>Compact)</hi> If the Devil and he have pack'd any thing together in hugger-mug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, 'tis a pack of Roguery to be ſure, and they are a pack of Knaves for their pains, and let 'em e'en pack together ſay I. Thou do'ſt not apprehend me, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> I mean, the Devil and he muſt have made an Agreement together, that Satan ſhould infuſe this knowledge into the Ape, to purchaſe the owner an Eſtate; and in return, the
<pb n="867" facs="tcp:54446:469"/>
laſt has certainly engag'd his Soul to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive Seducer of Mankind. For the Ape's Knowledge is exactly of the ſame proportion with the Devil's, which only extends to the Diſcovery of things paſt and preſent, having no Inſight into Futurity, but by ſuch probable Conjectures and Concluſions as may be deduc'd from the former working of antecedent Cauſes; true Preſcience and Prediction being the Sacred Prerogative of God, to whoſe all-ſeeing Eyes, all Ages, paſt, preſent, and to come, without the diſtinction of Succeſſion and Termination, are always preſent. From this, I ſay, 'tis apparent this Ape is but the Organ through which the Devil delivers his Anſwers to thoſe that ask it Queſtions; and this ſame Rogue ſhould be put into the Inquiſition, and have the Truth preſs'd out of his Bones. For ſure neither the Maſter nor his Ape can lay any pretence to Judicial Aſtrology, nor is the Ape ſo converſant in the Mathematicks, I ſuppoſe, as to erect a Scheme. Though I muſt confeſs that Creatures of leſs parts, as fooliſh-illiterate Women, Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Coblers, pretend now a-days to draw Certainties from the Stars, as eaſily and readily as they ſhuffle a Pack of Cards, to the Diſgrace of the Sublime Science, which they have the Impudence to Profeſs I knew a Lady that ask'd one of theſe Figure-caſters, if a little foiſting Bitch ſhe had ſhould have Puppies, and how many, and of what Colour? My Conjurer, after he had ſcrawl'd out his Scheme, very judiciouſly pronounc'd, that the pretty Creature ſhould have three delicate Pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, one Green, one Red, and another Mix'd-colour'd; provided ſhe ſhould take Dog between eleven and twelve at Night or Noon, either on a <hi>Monday</hi> or a <hi>Saturday;</hi> and the ſucceſs happen'd as exactly as could be expected from his Art; for
<pb n="868" facs="tcp:54446:470"/>
the Bitch ſome Days after, dy'd very fairly of a Surfeit, and Maſter Figure-ſlinger was reputed a ſpecial Conjurer all the Town over, as moſt of theſe Fellows are. For all that, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> I would have you ask Maſter <hi>Peter</hi>'s Ape, whether the Paſſages you told us concerning <hi>Monteſinos</hi>'s Cave be true or no; for ſaving the reſpect I owe your Worſhip, I take them to be no better than Fibbs, and idle Stories or Dreams at leaſt. You may think what you will, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I'll do as you would have me, though I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs my Conſcience ſomewhat ſcruples to do ſuch a thing. While they were thus engag'd in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, Maſter <hi>Peter</hi> came and told Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> the Show was ready to begin, and deſir'd him to come and ſee it, for he was ſure his Worſhip would like it. The Knight told him he had a Queſtion to put to his Ape firſt, and deſir'd he might tell him, whether certain things that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to him in <hi>Monteſinos</hi>'s Cave were Dreams or Realities, for he doubted they had ſomething of both in them. Maſter <hi>Peter</hi> fetch'd his Ape im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and placing him juſt before the Knight and his Squire; look you, ſays he, Mr. Ape, this worthy Knight would have you tell him whether ſome things which happen'd to him in <hi>Monteſinos</hi>'s Cave were true or no? Then upon the uſual Signal, the Ape jumping upon Maſter <hi>Peter</hi>'s Shoulder, chatter'd his anſwer into his Ear, which the Interpreter delivered thus to the Enquirer. The Ape, Sir, Says, that part of thoſe things are falſe, and part of them true, which is all he can reſolve ye, as to this Queſtion; and now his Virtue has left him, and won't return till <hi>Friday</hi> next. If you would know any more, you muſt ſtay till then, and he'll anſwer as many Queſtions as you pleaſe. Law you there now, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> did
<pb n="869" facs="tcp:54446:470"/>
not I tell you, that all you told us of <hi>Monteſinos</hi>'s Cave would not hold Water? That the Event will determine, reply'd the Knight, which we muſt leave to proceſs of Time to produce; for it brings every thing to light, though buried in the Bowels of the Earth. No more of this at preſent; let us now ſee the Puppet-ſhow; I fancy we ſhall find ſomething in it worth ſeeing. Something! ſaid Maſter <hi>Peter,</hi> Sir you ſhall ſee a thouſand things worth your Sight. I tell you, Sir, I defy the World to ſhew ſuch another. I ſay no more. <hi>Operibus credite &amp; non verbis.</hi> But now let us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, for it grows late, and we have much to do ſay and ſhow. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> comply'd, and went into the Room where the Show ſtood with a good number of ſmall Wax-Lights glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering round about, that made it ſhine gloriouſly. Maſter <hi>Peter</hi> got to his Station within, being the Man that was to move the Puppets; and his Boy ſtood before to tell what the Puppets ſaid, and with a white Wand in his Hand to point at the ſeveral Figures as they came in and out, and explain the Myſtery of the Show. Then all the Audience having taken their Places, Don <hi>Quixote, Sancho,</hi> the Scholar, and the Page, being preferr'd to the beſt; the Boy, who was the Mouth of the Motion, began a Story, that ſhall be heard or ſeen by thoſe who will take the pains to read or hear the next Chapter.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XXVI.</hi> A Pleaſant Account of the Puppet-Play, with other very good things, truly.</head>
                        <p>THE <hi>Tyrians</hi> and the <hi>Trojans</hi> were all ſilent; that is, the Ears of all the Spectators hung on the Mouth of the Interpreter of the Show, when in the firſt place they had a loud flouriſh of Kettle-Drums and Trumpets within the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine, and then ſeveral diſcharges of Artillery; which prelude being ſoon over, Gentlemen, cry'd the Boy raiſing his Voice, We preſent you here with a true Hiſtory taken out of the Chronicles of <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ballads, ſung even by the Boys about the Streets, and in every Body's Mouth; it tells you how Don <hi>Gayferos</hi> deliver'd his Wife <hi>Meliſandra,</hi> that was a Priſoner among the Moors in <hi>Spain,</hi> in the City of <hi>Sanſuena,</hi> now call'd <hi>Saragoſſa.</hi> Now, Gallants, the firſt Figure we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent you with, is Don <hi>Gayferos</hi> playing at Tables according to the Ballad.</p>
                        <q>
                           <l>Now <hi>Gayferos</hi> the live-long-day,</l>

                        <p>Gentlemen, in the next place mark that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage that peeps out there with a Crown on his Head and a Scepter in his Hand. 'Tis the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Charlemain,</hi> the fair <hi>Meliſandra</hi>'s reputed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="871" facs="tcp:54446:471"/>
who, vex'd at the idleneſs and negligence of his Son-in-Law, comes to chide him; and pray obſerve with what Paſſion and Earneſtneſs he rates him, as if he had a mind to lend him half a dozen ſound raps over the Pate with his Scepter. Nay, ſome Authors don't ſtick to tell ye, he gave him as many, and well laid on too; and after he had told him how his Honour lay a bleeding, till he had deliver'd his Wife out of Durance, among many other pithy Sayings, look to it (quoth he to him as he went) I'll ſay no more. Mind how the Emperor turns his Back upon him, and how he leaves Don <hi>Gayferos</hi> nettl'd and in the Dumps. Now ſee how he ſtarts up, and in a rage dings the Tables one way, and Whirls the Men another, and calling for his Arms with all haſte, borrows his Couſin-German <hi>Orlando</hi>'s Sword <hi>Durindana.</hi> He offers to go along with him in this difficult Adventure; but the valorous enrag'd Knight will not let him; and ſays he's able to deliver his Wife himſelf, without his help, tho' they kept her down in the very Center of the Earth. And now he's going to put on his Armour, in order to begin his Journey.</p>
                        <p>Now Gentlemen, caſt your Eyes upon you Tower; you are to ſuppoſe it one of the Towers of the Caſtle of <hi>Saragoſſa,</hi> now call'd the <hi>Aljaferia.</hi> That Lady, whom you ſee in the Balcony there in a <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Habit, is the Peerleſs <hi>Meliſandra,</hi> that caſts many a heavy look towards <hi>France,</hi> thinking of <hi>Paris</hi> and her Husband, the only Comfort in her Impriſonment. But now! (Silence, Gentlemen, pray Silence!) here is an Accident wholly new, the like perhaps never heard of before: Don't you ſee that Moor who comes a tiptoes, creeping and ſtealing along with his Finger in his Mouth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind <hi>Meliſandra?</hi> Here what a ſmack he gives on
<pb n="872" facs="tcp:54446:472"/>
her ſweet Lips, and ſee how ſhe ſpits and wipes her Mouth with her white Smock-Sleeve! See how ſhe takes on, and Tears her lovely Hair for very madneſs, as if 'twere to blame for this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front. Next pray obſerve that grave <hi>Moor</hi> that ſtands in the open Gallery! That's <hi>Marſilius</hi> the King of <hi>Sanſuena,</hi> who having been an Eye-Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſaucineſs of the <hi>Moor,</hi> order'd him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to be apprehended, (tho' his Kinſman and great Favourite) to have two hundred Laſhes given him, then to be carried thro' the City, with Criers before to proclaim his Crime, and Rods of Juſtice behind. And look how all this is put in Execution ſooner almoſt than the Fact is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For your <hi>Moors,</hi> ye muſt know, don't uſe any form of Indictment as we do, neither have they any Legal Tryals. Child, Child, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> go on directly with your Story, and don't keep us here with your Excurſions and Ramblings out of the Road: I tell you there had need be a formal Proceſs and Legal Tryal to prove matter of Fact. Boy, ſaid the Maſter from behind the Show, do as the Gentleman bids you. Don't run ſo much upon Flouriſhes, but follow your plain Cant, without venturing on the high Ropes, for fear of ſpoiling all. I will, Sir, quoth the Boy, and ſo proceeding, Now, Sirs, he that you ſee there a Horſe-back wrapt up in the <hi>Gaſcoign</hi>-Cloak, is Don <hi>Gayferos</hi> himſelf, whom his Wife (now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd on the <hi>Moor</hi> for his Impudence) ſeeing from the Battlements of the Tower, takes him for a Stranger, and talks with him as ſuch, according to the Ballad.</p>

                           <l>Quoth <hi>Meliſandra,</hi> if per Chance</l>

                        <p>I omit the reſt, not to tire you with a long Story. 'Tis ſufficient that he makes himſelf known to her, as you may gueſs by the Joy ſhe ſhews; and accordingly now ſee how ſhe lets herſelf down from the Balcony, to come at her loving Husband, and get behind him. But unhappily alas! one of the skirts of her Gown is caught upon one of the Spikes of the Balcony, and there ſhe hangs and hovers in the Air miſerably, without being able to get down. But ſee how Heaven is merciful, and ſends relief in the greateſt Diſtreſs! Now Don <hi>Gayferos</hi> rides up to her, and never minding the Richneſs of her Gown, lays hold on't, and at one pull brings her down, and then at one lift ſets her aſtride upon his Horſe's Crupper, bidding her to ſit faſt, and clap her Arms about him, that ſhe might not fall; for the Lady <hi>Meliſandra</hi> was not us'd to that kind of Riding.</p>

Don <hi>Gayferos</hi> and the fair <hi>Meliſandra</hi> by this Time, had I not been here and ſtood up in their Defence! I make no Queſtion but thoſe Infidels wou'd have apprehended 'em, and us'd 'em barbarouſly. Well, when all's done, long live Knight-Errantry, long let it live, I ſay, above all things whatſoever in this World. Ay, ay, ſaid Maſter <hi>Peter</hi> in a dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Tone, let it live long for me, ſo I may die; for why ſhould I live ſo unhappy, as to ſay with King<note n="*" place="bottom">The laſt King of the <hi>Goths</hi> that reign'd in <hi>Spain,</hi> conquer'd by the <hi>Moors.</hi>

What's worſt of all, I've loſt my Ape too, who I'm ſure will make me ſweat e'er I catch him again; and all through the raſh Fury of this Sir Knight here, who they ſay protects the Fatherleſs, redreſſes Wrongs, and does other charitable Deeds, but has fail'd in all theſe good Offices to miſerable me, Heaven be prais'd for't! Well may I call him the Knight of the Woeful Figure, for he has put me and all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to me in a woeful Caſe.

<pb n="877" facs="tcp:54446:475"/>
Truly, ſaid Maſter <hi>Peter,</hi> if his Worſhip wou'd but make good at leaſt ſome of the Damage he has done me, I'll ask no more, and he'll diſcharge a good Conſcience; for he that wrongs his Neighbour, and does not make Reſtitution, can never hope to be ſav'd, that's certain. I grant it, ſaid Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote;</hi> but I am not ſenſible how I have in the leaſt injur'd you, good Maſter <hi>Peter.</hi> No Sir! not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd me, cry'd Maſter <hi>Peter!</hi> Why theſe poor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks that lie here on the cold Ground, cry out for Vengeance againſt you. Was it not the invincible Force of that powerful Arm of yours that has ſcatter'd and diſmember'd 'em ſo? And whoſe were thoſe Bodies, Sir, but mine? and by whom was I maintain'd, but by them? Well, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> now I am thoroughly convinc'd of a Truth, which I have had Reaſon to believe before, that thoſe curſed Magicians that daily perſecute me do nothing but delude me, firſt drawing me into dangerous Adventures by the Appearances of them as really they are, and then preſently after changing the Face of things as they pleaſe. Real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and truly Gentlemen, I vow and proteſt before ye all that hear me, that all that was acted here, ſeem'd to me to be really tranſacted <hi>ipſo facto</hi> as it appear'd. To me <hi>Meliſandra</hi> appear'd to be <hi>Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandra,</hi> Don <hi>Gayferos</hi> was Don <hi>Gayferos, Marſilius Marſilius,</hi> and <hi>Charlemain</hi> was the real <hi>Charlemain:</hi> Which being ſo, I could not contain my Fury, and acted according to the Duties of my Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which obliges me to take the injur'd Side. Now, tho' what I have done proves to be quite contrary to my good Deſign, the Fault ought not to be imputed to me, but to my perſecuting Foes; yet I own my ſelf ſorry for the Miſchance, and will condemn my ſelf to pay the Coſts. Let Maſter <hi>Peter</hi> ſee what he muſt have for the Figures
<pb n="878" facs="tcp:54446:476"/>
that are damag'd, and I will pay it him now in good and lawful Money on the Nail. Heaven bleſs your Worſhip, cry'd Maſter <hi>Peter</hi> with a profound Gringe; I cou'd expect no leſs from the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Chriſtianity of the valorous Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> the ſure Relief and Bulwark of all miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Wanderers. Now let my Landlord and the great <hi>Sancho</hi> be Mediators and Appraiſers between your Worſhip and my ſelf, and I'll ſtand to their Award. They agreed; and preſently Maſter <hi>Peter</hi> taking up <hi>Marſilius</hi> King of <hi>Saragoſſa,</hi> that lay by on the Ground with his Head off; You ſee Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, ſaid he, 'tis impoſſible to reſtore this King to his former Dignity, and therefore, with Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to your better Judgments, I think that for his Deſtruction, and to get him a Succeſſor,<note n="*" place="margin">Four Reals and a Half.</note> ſeven and twenty Pence is little enough o' Conſcience. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote.</hi> Then for this that is cleft in two (ſaid Maſter <hi>Peter,</hi> taking up the Emperor <hi>Charlemain)</hi> I think he's richly worth<note n="†" place="margin">Five Reals and a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> one and thirty Pence Half-Penny. Not ſo richly neither, quoth <hi>Sancho.</hi> Truly, ſaid the Inn-keeper, I think 'tis pretty reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but we'll make it even Money, let the poor Fellow have Half a Crown. Come, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> let him have his full Price; we'll not ſtand haggling for ſo ſmall a Matter in a Caſe like this: So make Haſte Maſter <hi>Peter,</hi> for 'tis near Supper-time, and I have ſome ſtrong Preſumptions that I ſhall eat heartily. Now, ſaid Maſter <hi>Peter,</hi> for this Figure here that's without a Noſe and blind of one Eye, being the fair <hi>Meliſandra,</hi> I'll be reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<pb n="879" facs="tcp:54446:476"/>
with you; give me<note n="*" place="margin">Two Reals and twelve Maravedis.</note> fourteen Pence. I wou'd not take leſs from my Brother. Nay, ſaid Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote,</hi> the Devil's in't if <hi>Meliſandra</hi> been't by this Time with her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band upon the Frontiers of <hi>France</hi> at leaſt; for the Horſe that carry'd 'em ſeem'd to me rather to fly than to gallop; and now you tell me of a <hi>Meliſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra</hi> here without a Noſe forſooth! when 'tis ten to one but ſhe's now in her Husband's Arms in a good Bed in <hi>France.</hi> Come come Friend, God help ev'ry Man to his own; let us have fair Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſo proceed. Maſter <hi>Peter</hi> finding that the Knight began to harp upon the old String, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid he wou'd fly off; and making as if he had better conſider'd of it, Cry y'Mercy Sir, ſaid he; I was miſtaken; this cou'd not be <hi>Meliſandra</hi> indeed, but one of the Damſels that waited on her; and ſo I think five Pence will be fair enough for her. In this Manner he went on, ſetting his Price upon the Dead and Wounded, which the Arbitrators moderated to the Content of both Parties; and the whole Sum amounted to forty Reals and three Quarters, which <hi>Sancho</hi> paid him down; and then Maſter <hi>Peter</hi> demanded two Reals more, for the Trouble of catching his Ape. Give it him, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and ſet the Monkey to catch the Ape; and now wou'd I give two hundred more to be aſſur'd that Don <hi>Gayferos</hi> and the Lady <hi>Meliſnd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

No Body can better tell than my Ape, ſaid Maſter <hi>Peter;</hi> tho' the Devil himſelf will hardly catch him, if Hunger, or his Kindneſs for me, don't bring us together again to Night. However, to Morrow will be a new Day, and when 'tis light we'll ſee what's to be done.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="880" facs="tcp:54446:477"/>The whole Diſturbance being appeas'd, to Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per they went lovingly together; and Don <hi>Quixote</hi> treated the whole Company, for he was Liberality it ſelf. Before Day the Man with the Lances and Halbards left the Inn; and ſome Time after the Scholar and the Page came to take Leave of the Knight, the firſt to return Home, and the ſecond to continue his Journey, towards whoſe Charges Don <hi>Quixote</hi> gave him twelve Reals. As for Maſter <hi>Peter,</hi> he knew too much of the Knight's Humour to deſire to have any thing to do with him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having pick'd up the Ruins of the Puppet-Show, and got his Ape again, by Break of Day he pack'd off to ſeek his Fortune. The Inn-keeper, who did not know Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> was as much ſurpriz'd at his Liberality as at his Madneſs. In fine, <hi>Sancho</hi> paid him very honeſtly by his Maſter's Order; and mounting a little before eight a Clock, they left the Inn, and proceeded on their Journey; where we will leave 'em, that we may have an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to relate ſome other Matters very requiſite for the better underſtanding of this famous Hiſtory.</p>

                           <hi>CID Hamet,</hi> the Author of this celebrated Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, begins this Chapter with this Aſſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>I ſwear as a true Catholick;</hi> which the Tranſlator illuſtrates and explains in this Manner: That Hiſtorian's making uſe of a Chriſtian Oath, tho' he was a Mahometan <hi>Moor,</hi> ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in no other Senſe, than that, as a true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, when he affirms any thing with an Oath, does or ought to ſwear Truth; ſo would he relate the Truth, as impartially as a Chriſtian would do, if he had taken ſuch an Oath, in what he deſign'd to write of Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> eſpecially as to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that is to be given us of the Perſon who was known by the Name of Maſter <hi>Peter,</hi> and the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune-telling Ape, whoſe Anſwers occaſion'd ſuch a Noiſe, and created ſuch an Amazement all over the Country. He ſays then, that any one who has read the foregoing Part of this Hiſtory, cannot but remember one <hi>Gines de Paſſamonte,</hi> whom Don <hi>Quixote</hi> had reſcu'd, with ſeveral other Galley-Slaves in <hi>Sierra Morena;</hi> a Piece of Service for which the Knight was not over-burden'd with Thanks, and which that ungrateful Pack of Rogues repaid with a Treatment altogether unworthy ſuch
<pb n="882" facs="tcp:54446:478"/>
a Deliverance. This <hi>Gines de Paſſamonte,</hi> or, as Don <hi>Quixote</hi> call'd him, <hi>Gineſillo de Parapilla,</hi> was the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man that ſtole <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Aſs; the Manner of which Robbery, and the Time when it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, being not inſerted in the firſt Part, has been the Reaſon that ſome People have laid that which was caus'd by the Printer's Neglect to the Inadvertency of the Author. But 'tis beyond all queſtion that <hi>Gines</hi> ſtole the Aſs while <hi>Sancho</hi> ſlept on his Back, making uſe of the ſame Trick and Artifice which <hi>Brunello</hi> practis'd when he carry'd off <hi>Sacripante</hi>'s Horſe from under his Legs at the Siege of <hi>Albraca.</hi> However <hi>Sancho</hi> got Poſſeſſion again, as has been told you before.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Gines</hi> it ſeems being obnoxious to the Law, was apprehenſive of the ſtrict Search that was made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, in order to bring him to Juſtice for his repeated Villanies, which were ſo great and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, that he himſelf had wrote a large Book of 'em; and therefore he thought it adviſable to make the beſt of his Way into the Kingdom of <hi>Arragon;</hi> and having clapp'd a Plaiſter over his Left Eye, reſolv'd in that Diſguiſe to ſet up a Puppet-Show, and ſtroll with it about the Country; for you muſt know he had not his Fellow at any thing that could be done by Slight of Hand. Now it happen'd, that in his Way he fell into the Company of ſome Chriſtian Slaves who came from <hi>Barbary,</hi> and ſtruck a Bargain with 'em for this Ape, whom he taught to leap on his Shoulder at a certain Sign, and to make as if he whiſper'd ſomething in his Ear. Having brought his Ape to this, before he enter'd into any Town he inform'd himſelf in the adjacent Parts, as well as he could, of what particular Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents had happen'd to this or that Perſon; and having a very retentive Memory, the firſt thing he did was to give 'em a Sight of his Show, that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="883" facs="tcp:54446:478"/>
ſometimes one Story and ſometimes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which were generally well known and taking among the Vulgar. The next thing he had to do was to commend the wonderful Qualities of his Ape, and tell the Company, That the Animal had the Gift of revealing things paſs'd and preſent, but that in things to come he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together uninſtructed.

Sometimes when he came to the Houſes of People of whoſe Concerns he had ſome Account, and who wou'd ask the Ape no Queſtions becauſe they did not care to part with their Money, he wou'd notwithſtanding be making Signs to his Ape, and tell 'em the Animal had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him with this or that Story, according to the Information he had before; and by that Means he got a great Credit among the common People, and drew a mighty Croud after him. At other Times, tho' he knew nothing of the Perſon, the Subtilty of his Wit ſupply'd his want of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and brought him off with Credit; and no Body being ſo inquiſitive or preſſing as to make him declare by what Means his Ape attain'd to this Gift of Divination, he impos'd on every one's Underſtanding, and got almoſt what Money he pleas'd.</p>

                           <pb n="884" facs="tcp:54446:479"/>Now let us overtake our Champion of <hi>la Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha.</hi> After he had left the Inn, he reſolv'd to take a Sight of the River <hi>Ebro,</hi> and the Country about it, before he went to <hi>Saragoſſa,</hi> ſince he was not ſtreighten'd for Time, but might do that, and yet arrive ſoon enough to make one at the Jouſts and Tournaments at that City. Two Days he travell'd without meeting with any thing worth his Notice or the Reader's, when on the third, as he was rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up a Hill, he heard a great Noiſe of Drums, Trumpets, and Guns. At firſt he thought ſome Regiment of Soldiers was on its March that Way, which made him ſpur up <hi>Rozinante</hi> to the Brow of the Hill that he might ſee 'em paſs by; and then he ſaw in a Bottom above two hundred Men, as near as he cou'd gueſs, arm'd with various Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, as Lances, Croſs-bows, Partiſans, Halbards, Pikes, ſome few Fire-locks, and a great many Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets. Thereupon he deſcended into the Vale, and made his Approaches towards the Battallion ſo near, as to be able to diſtinguiſh their Banners, judge of their Colours, and obſerve their Devices; more eſpecially one that was to be ſeen on a Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of white Sattin, on which was repreſented to the Life a maſculine Aſs, much like a <hi>Sardinian</hi> Aſs Colt, holding up his Head, ſtretching out his Neck, and thruſting out his Tongue in the very Poſture of an Aſs that is braying, with this Diſtich written in fair Characters about it; <q>
                              <l>'Twas ſomething more than Nothing which one Day</l>
                              <l>Made one and t'other Bailiff bray.</l>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Don <hi>Quixote</hi> drew this Inference from the Motto, That thoſe were the Inhabitants of the braying Town; and he acquainted <hi>Sancho</hi> with what he had obſerv'd, giving him alſo to underſtand, that the
<pb n="885" facs="tcp:54446:479"/>
Man who told 'em the Story of the two braying Aldermen was apparently in the Wrong, ſince, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Verſes on the Standard, they were two Bailiffs and not two Aldermen. It matters not one Ruſh what you call 'em, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> for thoſe very Aldermen that bray'd might in Time come to be made Bailiffs of the Town, and ſo both thoſe Titles might have been given 'em well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. But what is it to you, or me, or the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, whether the two Brayers were Aldermen or Bailiffs, ſo they but bray'd as we are told? As if a Bailiff were not as likely to bray as an Alderman!</p>
                        <p>In ſhort, both Maſter and Man plainly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that the Men who were thus up in Arms, were thoſe that were jeer'd for Braying, got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Fight the People of another Town, who indeed abus'd' them more than was the part of good Neighbours; thereupon Don <hi>Quixote</hi> advanc'd towards them, to <hi>Sancho</hi>'s great Grief, who had no manner of liking to ſuch kind of Adventures. The Multitude ſoon got about the Knight, taking him for ſome Champion, who was come to their Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. But Don <hi>Quixote</hi> lifting up his Vizor, with a graceful Deportment, rode up to the Standard, and there all the chief Leaders of the Army got together about him, in order to take a Survey of his Perſon, no leſs amaz'd at this ſtrange Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance than the reſt. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ſeeing 'em look ſo earneſtly on him, and no Man offer ſo much as a Word or Queſtion, took Occaſion from their Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to break his own; and raiſing his Voice, Good Gentlemen, cry'd he, I beſeech you with all the Endearments imaginable, to give no Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption to the Diſcourſe I am now delivering to you, unleſs you find it diſtaſteful or tedious; which if I am unhappy enough to occaſion, at the leaſt hint you ſhall give me, I will clap a Seal on my
<pb n="886" facs="tcp:54446:480"/>
Lips, and a Padlock on my Tongue. They all cry'd, that he might ſpeak what he pleas'd, and they would hear him with all their Hearts. Having this Licence, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> proceeded. Gentlemen, ſaid he, I am a Knight Errant: Arms are my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe; and my Profeſſion is to ſhew Favour to thoſe that are in Neceſſity of Favour, and to give Aſſiſtance to thoſe that are in Diſtreſs. I have for ſome Time been no Stranger to the Cauſe of your Uneaſineſs, which excites you to take Arms to be reveng'd on your Inſulting Neighbours; and having often buſied my Intellectuals, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Reflections on the Motives which have brought you together, I have drawn this Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from it, That according to the Laws of Arms, you really injure your ſelves, in thinking your ſelves affronted; for no particular Perſon can give an Affront to a whole Town and Society of Men, except it be by accuſing 'em all of High Treaſon in general, for want of knowing on which of them to fix ſome Treaſonable Action, of which he ſuppoſes ſome of them to be guilty. We have an Inſtance of this Nature in Don <hi>Diego Ordonnez, de Lara;</hi> who ſent a Challenge to all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Zamora,</hi> not knowing that <hi>Vellido de Oifo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

                           </hi> had Aſſaſſinated the King his Maſter in that Town, without any Accomplices, and ſo accuſing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying 'em all, the Defence and Revenge belong'd to 'em all in general. Though it muſt be own'd, that Don <hi>Diego</hi> was ſomewhat unreaſonable in his Defiance, and ſtrain'd the Point too far: For, it it was very little to the Purpoſe to defy the Dead, the Waters, the Bread, thoſe that were yet Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, with many other ludicrous matters mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Challenge. But it ſignifies not much; for when the Choler boils over, the Tongue grows as unruly, and knows no Moderation. Taking it
<pb n="887" facs="tcp:54446:480"/>
for granted then, that no particular Perſon can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front a whole Kingdom, Province, City, Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, or Body Politick; it is but juſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That 'tis needleſs to revenge ſuch a pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Affront; ſince ſuch an Abuſe is no ſufficient Provocation, and indeed, poſitively no Affront. It would be a pretty Piece of Wiſdom, truly, ſhould thoſe out of the Town of <hi>Reloxa</hi> ſally out every Day on thoſe, who ſpend their ill-natur'd Breaths miſcalling 'em every while. 'Twould be a fine Buſineſs indeed, if the Inhabitants of thoſe ſeveral famous Towns that are nick-nam'd by our Rabble, and call'd the one Cheeſe-mongers, the other Coſter-mongers, theſe Fiſh-mongers, and thoſe Soap-boilers, ſhould know no better than to think themſelves Diſhonour'd, and in Revenge, be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways drawing out their Swords at the leaſt Word, for every idle inſignificant Quarrel. No, no, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven forbid. Men of Sagacity and Wiſdom, and well-govern'd Commonwealths are never induc'd to take up Arms, nor endanger their Perſons and Eſtates, but on the four following Occaſions. In the firſt Place, to defend the Holy Catholick Faith. Secondly, for the Security of their Lives, which they are commanded to preſerve by the Laws of God and Nature. Thirdly, the Preſervation of their good Name, the Reputation of their Family, and the Conſervation of their Eſtates. Fourthly, the Service due to their Prince in a juſt War; and if we pleaſe, we may add a Fifth, which indeed may be referr'd to the ſecond, the Defence of our Country. To theſe five Capital Cauſes may be ſubjoin'd ſeveral others, which may perſwade Men to vindicate themſelves, and have Recourſe even to the way of Arms: But to take 'em up for meer Trifles, and ſuch Occaſions as rather challenge our Mirth and contemptuous Laughter, than Revenge,
<pb n="888" facs="tcp:54446:481"/>
ſhews the Perſon who is guilty of ſuch Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to labour under a Scarcity of Senſe. Beſides, to ſeeK after an unjuſt Revenge (and indeed no Humane Revenge can be juſt) is directly againſt the Holy Law we profeſs, which commands us to forgive our Enemies, and to do good to thoſe that Hate us. An Injunction, which, though it ſeems difficult in the Implicit Obedience we ſhou'd pay to it; yet is only ſuch to thoſe who have leſs of Heaven than of the World, and more of the Fleſh than of the Spirit. For, the Redeemer of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, whoſe Words never could deceive, ſaid, <hi>That his Yoak was eaſy, and his Burden light;</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that, he could preſcribe nothing to our Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe which was impoſſible to be done. Therefore, Gentlemen, ſince Reaſon and Religion recommend Love and Peace to you, I hope you will not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your ſelves Obnoxious to all Laws, both Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and Divine, by a Breach of the publick Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility— The Devil fetch me, quoth <hi>Sancho</hi> to himſelf, if this Maſter of mine muſt not have been bred a Parſon; if not, he's as like one as one Egg's like another. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> paus'd a while, to take Breath; and perceiving his Auditory ſtill willing to give him Attention, had proceeded in his Harangue, had not <hi>Sancho</hi>'s good Opinion of his Parts, made him lay hold on this Opportunity to talk in his Turn. Gentlemen, quoth he, my Maſter Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> once call'd the Knight of the woeful Figure, and now the Knight of the Lions, is a very judicious Gentleman, and talks Latin and his own Mother-Tongue as well as any one of your Varſity-Doctors. Whatever Diſcourſe he takes in hand, he ſpeaks ye to the Purpoſe, and like a Man of Metal; he has ye all the Laws and Rules of that ſame thing you call Duel and Punctilio of Honour, at his Fingers Ends; ſo that you have no more to
<pb n="889" facs="tcp:54446:481"/>
do but to do as he ſays, and if in taking his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel you ever tread awry, let the Blame be laid on my Shoulders. And indeed, as you've already been told, 'tis a very ſilly Fancy to hear one Bray; for I remember when I was a Boy, I could Bray as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as I liſted, and no body went about to hinder me; and I could do it ſo rarely, and to the Life, without Vanity be it ſpoken, that all the Aſſes i'our Town would fall a Braying when they heard me Bray; yet for all this, I was an honeſt Body's Child, and came of a good Parentage, d'ye ſee; 'tis true, indeed, four of the beſt young Men in our Pariſh envy'd me for this great Ability of mine; but I car'd not a Ruſh for their Spight. Now, that you mayn't think I tell you a Flam, do but hear me, and then judge; for this rare Art is like Swimming, which, when once learn'd, is never to be forgotten. This ſaid, he clapp'd both the Palms of his Hands to his Noſe, and fell a Braying ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreperouſly, that it made the Neighbouring Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys ring again. But while he was thus Braying, one of thoſe that ſtood next him, believing he did it to Mock 'em, gave him ſuch a hearty Blow with a Quarter Staff, that down he brought him Neck and Shoulders to the Ground. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ſeeing what a rough Entertainment had been given to his Squire, mov'd with his Lance in a threatning Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture towards the Man that had us'd poor <hi>Sancho</hi> thus; but the Crowd thruſt themſelves in ſuch a manner between them, that the Knight found it impracticable to purſue the Revenge he deſign'd. At the ſame time, finding that a Shower of Stones began to Rain about his Ears, and a great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Croſs-Bows and Muskets were getting ready for his Reception, he turn'd <hi>Rozinante</hi>'s Reins, and Gallop'd from 'em as faſt as four Legs would carry him, ſending up his hearty Prayers to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="890" facs="tcp:54446:482"/>
to deliver him from this Danger, and, being under grievous Apprehenſions at every Step, that he ſhould be ſhot through the Back, and have the Bullet come out at his Breaſt, he ſtill went fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Breath, to try if it did any ways fail him. But the Country-Battalion were ſatisfy'd with ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him fly, and did not offer to ſhoot at him.</p>
                        <p>As for <hi>Sancho,</hi> he was ſet upon his Aſs before he had well recover'd his Senſes which the Blow had taken from him, and then they ſuffer'd him to move off; not that the poor Fellow had Strength enough to guide him; but <hi>Dapple</hi> naturally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd <hi>Rozinante</hi> of his own accord, not being able to be a Moment from him. The Don being at a good Diſtance from the Arm'd Multitude, fac'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and ſeeing <hi>Sancho</hi> Pacing after him without any troubleſome Attendants, ſtay'd for his coming up. As for the Rabble, they kept their Poſts till it grew dark, and their Enemies having not taken the Field to give 'em Battel, they March'd Home, ſo overjoy'd to have ſhewn their Courage without Danger, that had they been ſo well bred, as to have known the antient Cuſtom of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> they would have erected a Trophy in that Place.</p>

                        <p>WHen the Valiant flies, he muſt have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd ſome foul Play, and 'tis the part of prudent Perſons to reſerve themſelves for more favourable Opportunities. This Truth is verified in Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> who, rather than expoſe himſelf to the Fury of an incens'd and ill-deſigning Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, betook himſelf to Flight, without any Thoughts of <hi>Sancho,</hi> till he found himſelf beyond the reach of thoſe Dangers in which he had left his truſty Squire involv'd. <hi>Sancho</hi> came after him, as we have told you before, laid a-croſs his Aſs, and having recover'd his Senſes, overtook him at laſt, and let himſelf drop from his Pack-ſaddle at <hi>Rozi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nante</hi>'s Feet, all Batter'd and Bruis'd, and in a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful Condition. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> preſently diſmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſearch his Wounds, and finding no Bones bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but his Skin whole from Head to Foot; You muſt Bray, (cry'd he angrily) you muſt Bray, with a Pox, muſt you! 'Tis a piece of excellent Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to talk of Halters in the Houſe of a Man whoſe Father was Hang'd. What Counter-part could you expect to your Muſick, Blockhead, but a Thorough-Baſs of Baſtinadoes? Thank Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Sirrah! that as they gave you a dry Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction with a Quarter-Staff, they did not croſs you with a Cutlaſs. I han't Breath to anſwer you
<pb n="892" facs="tcp:54446:483"/>
at preſent, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but my Back and Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſpeak enough for me. Pray let's make the beſt of our way from this Curſed Place, and whene'er I Bray again, may I get ſuch another Polt on the Kidneys. Yet I can't help ſaying, that your Knights-Errant can betake themſelves to their Heels to ſave one upon Occaſion, and leave their truſty Squires to be beaten like Stock-fiſh, in the midſt of their Enemies. A Retreat is not to be accounted a Flight, reply'd Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> for know, <hi>Sancho,</hi> that Courage that has not Wiſdom for its Guide, falls under the Name of Temerity; and the raſh Man's ſucceſsful Actions are rather owing to his good Fortune, than to his Bravery. I own I did Retire, but I deny that I fled; and in ſuch a Retreat I did but imitate many Valiant Men, who, not to hazard their Perſons indiſcreetly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd themſelves for a more fortunate Hour. Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories are full of Examples of this nature, which I do not care to relate at preſent, becauſe this would be more tedious to me, than profitable to thee.</p>
                        <p>By this time Don <hi>Quixote</hi> had help'd <hi>Sancho</hi> to beſtride his Aſs, and being himſelf Mounted on <hi>Rozinante,</hi> they Pac'd ſoftly along, and got into a Grove of Poplar Trees, about a Quarter of a League from the Place where they Mounted. Yet as ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they rode, <hi>Sancho</hi> could not help now and then heaving up deep Sighs and lamentable Groans. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ask'd him, why he made ſuch a heavy Moan? <hi>Sancho</hi> told him, That from his Rump to his Pole, he felt ſuch grievous Pains, that he was ready to ſink. Without doubt, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> the Intenſeneſs of thy Torment, is by reaſon the Staff with which thou wert ſtruck, was broad and long, and ſo having fallen on thoſe parts of thy Back, cauſed a Contuſion there, and affects them
<pb n="893" facs="tcp:54446:483"/>
all with Pain, and had it been of a greater Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, thy Grievances had been ſo much the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Truly quoth <hi>Sancho!</hi> you've clear'd that in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pithy Words, of which no body made any doubt. Body of me! was the Cauſe of my ailing ſo hard to be gueſs'd, that you muſt tell me that ſo much of me was ſore as was hit by the Weapon? Shou'd my Ankle-bone ach, and you ſcratch your Head till you had found out the Cauſe of it, I would think that ſomething. But for you to tell me that Place is ſore where I was Bruis'd, every Fool could do as much. Faith and Troth, Sir Maſter of mine, I grow Wiſer and Wiſer every Day: I find you're like all the World, that lay to Heart no body's Harms but their own. I find where abouts we are, and what I'm like to get by you; for e'en as you left me now in the Lurch to be well belabour'd and Rib-roaſted, and t'other Day to dance the Carp-Galliard in the Blanket you wot of; ſo I muſt expect a hundred and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred more of theſe good Vails i' your Service; and as the Miſchief has now lighted on my Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, next Bout I look for it to fly at my Eyes. A Plague of my Jolter-head, I have been a Fool and Set all along, and am never like to be Wiſer while I live. Would it not be better for me to trudge home to my Wife and Children, and look after my Houſe with that little Wit that Heaven has given me, without galloping after your Tail high and low, through confounded croſs Roads and By-ways, and wicked and crooked Paths, that the Ungodly themſelves can't find out! And then moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have nothing to moiſten one's Weaſand that's fitting for a Chriſtian to drink, nothing but meer Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Dog's Porridge! And nothing to ſtuff one's Puddings that's worthy of a Catholick Stomach! Then after a Man has tir'd himſelf off his Legs,

Old Nick roaſt and burn to a Cinder that unlucky Son of Miſchief that firſt ſet People a madding after this Whim of Knight-Errantry; or at leaſt the firſt Ninny-hammer that had ſo little Forecaſt as to turn Squire to ſuch a Parcel of Mad-men as were your Knights-Errant—in the Days of Yore I mean; I am better bred than to ſpeak ill of thoſe in our Time; no I honour them, ſince your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip has taken up this bleſſed Calling; for you've a long Noſe, the Devil himſelf could not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach you, you can ſee farther into a Milſtone than he. I durſt lay a Wager, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> that now thou art ſuffer'd to prate without Interruption, thou feel'ſt no manner of Pain in thy whole Body. Prethee talk on, my Child, ſay any thing that comes uppermoſt to thy Mouth, or is Burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to thy Brain; ſo it but alleviates thy Pain, thy Impertinencies will rather pleaſe than offend me; and if thou haſt ſuch a longing Deſire to be at home with thy Wife and Children, Heaven for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid I ſhould be againſt it. Thou haſt Money of mine in thy Hands: See how long 'tis ſince we Sallied out laſt from Home, and caſt up the Wages by the Month, and Pay thy ſelf. An't like your Worſhip, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> when I ſerv'd my Maſter <hi>Carraſco,</hi> Father to the Batchelor, your Worſhip's Acquaintance, I had two Ducats a Month, beſides my Victuals: I don't know what you'll give me: tho' I'm ſure there's more Trouble in being Squire to a Knight-Errant, than in being Servant to a
<pb n="895" facs="tcp:54446:484"/>
Farmer; for truly we that go to Plough and Cart in a Farmer's Service, though we moil and ſweat ſo a-days as not to have a dry Thread to our Backs, let the worſt come to the worſt, are ſure of a Belly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful at Night out of the Pot, and to ſnore in a Bed. But I don't know when I have had a good Meal's Meat, or a good Night's Reſt in all your whole Service, unleſs it were that ſhort time when we were at Don <hi>Diego</hi>'s Houſe, and when I made a Feaſt on the ſavoury Skimming of <hi>Camacho</hi>'s Cauldron, and Eat, Drank, and Lay at Maſter <hi>Baſil</hi>'s. All the reſt of my time I have had my Lodging on the cold Ground, and in the open Fields, ſubject to the Inclemency of the Sky, as you call it; living on the Rinds of Cheeſe, and Cruſts of mouldy Bread; drinking ſometimes Ditch-water, ſometimes Spring, as we chanc'd to light upon't in our way. Well, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> I grant all this, <hi>Sancho;</hi> then how much more doſt thou expect from me, than thou had'ſt from thy Maſter <hi>Carraſco?</hi> Why, truly, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> if your Worſhip will Pay me Twelve-pence a Month more than <hi>Thomas Carraſco</hi> gave me, I ſhall think it very fair, and tolerable Wages; but then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the Iſland which you know you promis'd me, I think you can't in Conſcience give me leſs than ſix and thirty Pence a Month more, which will make in all Thirty Reals, neither more nor leſs. Very well, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> let's ſee then, 'tis now twenty five Days ſince we ſet out from home, reckon what this comes to, according to the Wages thou haſt allow'd thy ſelf, and be thy own Pay-maſter. Udſdiggers! quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> we are quite out in our Account; for as to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of an Iſland's Place, which you promiſed to help me to, we ought to reckon from the time you made the Promiſe, to this very Day. Well,
<pb n="896" facs="tcp:54446:485"/>
and pray how long is it, ask'd Don <hi>Quixote?</hi> If I remember rightly, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> 'tis about ſome twenty Years ago, two or three Days more or leſs. With that Don <hi>Quixote</hi> hitting himſelf a good clap on the Forehead, fell a Laughing heartily. Why, cry'd he, we have hardly been out two Months from the very beginning of our firſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, and in all the time we were in <hi>Sierra Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rena,</hi> and our whole Progreſs. And haſt thou the Impudence to affirm it's twenty Years ſince I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd the Grant of the Iſland? I am now convinc'd thou haſt a Mind to make all the Money which thou haſt of mine in thy keeping, go for the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thy Wages. If this be thy Meaning, well and good, e'en take it, and much Good may it do thee; for rather than be troubled any longer with ſuch a Varlet, I would contentedly ſee my ſelf without a Penny. But tell me, thou Perverter of the Laws of Chivalry that relate to Squires, where did'ſt thou ever ſee or read, that any Squire to a Knight-Errant ſtood capitulating with his Maſter, as thou haſt done with me, for ſo much or ſo much a Month? Lanch, unconſcionable Wretch, thou Cut-Throat Scoundrel; lanch, thou baſe Spirit of Mammon, into the vaſt Ocean of their Hiſtories; and if thou can'ſt ſhew me a Precedent of any Squire that ever dar'd to ſay, or but to think as much as thou haſt preſum'd to tell me, then will I give thee Leave to affix it on my Fore-head, and hit me four Fillips on the Noſe. Away then, pack off with thy Aſs this Moment, and get thee home, for thou ſhalt never ſtay in my Service any longer. Oh how much Bread, how many Promiſes have I not ill beſtow'd on thee! Vile groveling Wretch, that haſt more of the Beaſt than of the Man! When I was juſt going to prefer thee to ſuch a Poſt, that in ſpight of thy Wife thou had'ſt been
<pb n="897" facs="tcp:54446:485"/>
call'd my Lord, thou ſneak'ſt away from me. Thou'rt leaving me, when I had fully reſolv'd, without any more Delay, to make thee Lord of the beſt Iſland in the World. Sordid Clod! Well might'ſt thou ſay indeed, that Honey is not for the Chaps of an Aſs. Thou art indeed a very Aſs, an Aſs thou wilt live and an Aſs thou wilt die; for I dare ſay thou'lt never have Senſe enough while thou liv'ſt, to know thou art a Brute. While Don <hi>Quixote</hi> thus upbraided and rail'd at <hi>Sancho,</hi> the poor Fellow, all diſmay'd, and touch'd to the Quick, beheld him with a wiſtful Look; and the Tears ſtanding in his Eyes for Grief, Good ſweet Sir, cry'd he, with a doleful and whining Voice, I confeſs I want nothing but a Tail to be a perfect Aſs; if your Worſhip will be pleas'd but to put one to my Back-ſide, I ſhall deem it well ſet on, and be your moſt faithful Aſs all the Days of my Life: But forgive me, I beſeech you, and take Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on my Youth. Conſider I've but a dull Head-piece of my own; and if my Tongue runs at random ſometimes, 'tis becauſe I'm more Fool than Knave, Sir. Who errs and mends, to Heaven himſelf commends. I ſhou'd wonder much, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> if thou ſhould'ſt not interlard thy Diſcourſe with ſome pretty Proverb. Well, I'll give thee my Pardon for this once, provided thou correct thoſe Imperfections that offend me, and ſhew'ſt thy ſelf of a leſs craving Temper. Take Heart then, and let the Hopes which thou may'ſt entertain of the Performance of my Promiſe raiſe in thee a nobler Spirit. The Time will come, do not think it impoſſible becauſe delay'd. <hi>Sancho</hi> promis'd to do his beſt, though he could not rely on his own Strength.</p>
                        <p>Matters Being thus amicably adjuſted, they put into the Grove, where the Don laid himſelf at the
<pb n="898" facs="tcp:54446:486"/>
Foot of an Elm, and his Squire at the Foot of a Beach; for every one of thoſe Trees, and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, has always a Foot, tho' never a Hand. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> had but an ill Night's Reſt of it, for his Bruiſes made his Bones more than ordinarily ſenſible of the Cold. As for Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> he entertain'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with his uſual Imaginations. However they both ſlept, and by Break of Day continu'd their Journey towards the River <hi>Ebro,</hi> where they met — what ſhall be told in the next Chapter.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XXIX.</hi> The famous Adventure of the inchanted Bark.</head>
                        <p>FAIR and ſoftly, Step by Step, their Tongues wagging faſter than their Horſes, Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote</hi> and his Squire got in two Day's Time to the Banks of the River <hi>Ebro,</hi> which yielded a very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining Proſpect to the Knight. The Verdure of its Banks, and the abounding Plenty of the Water, which, clear like liquid Cryſtal, flow'd gently along within the ſpacious Channel, awak'd a thouſand amorous Chimera's in his roving Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and more eſpecially the Thoughts of what he had ſeen in <hi>Monteſinos</hi>'s Cave; for tho' Maſter <hi>Peter</hi>'s Ape had aſſur'd him that it was partly falſe as well as partly true, he was rather inclin'd to believe it all true; quite contrary to <hi>Sancho,</hi> who thought it every Tittle as falſe as Hell.</p>
                        <p>While the Knight went on thus agreeably a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus'd, he ſpy'd a little Boat without any Oars or Tackle, moor'd by the River-Side to the Stump of
<pb n="899" facs="tcp:54446:486"/>
a Tree: Thereupon looking round about him, and diſcovering no Body, he preſently alighted, and order'd <hi>Sancho</hi> to do the like, and tie their Beaſts faſt to ſome of the Elms or Willows thereabouts. <hi>Sancho</hi> ask'd him what was the Meaning of all this? Thou art to know, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> that moſt certain this Boat lies here for no other Reaſon but to invite me to embark in it, for the Relief of ſome Knight or other Perſon of high Degree that is in great Diſtreſs: For thus, according to the Method of Inchanters, in the Books of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry, when any Knight whom they protect hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be involv'd in ſome very great Danger, from which none but ſome other valorous Knight can ſet him free; then though they be two or three thouſand Leagues at leaſt diſtant from each other, up the Magician ſnatches the auxiliary Champion in a Cloud, or elſe provides him a Boat, and in the Twinkling of an Eye, in either Vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, through the airy Fluid or the liquid Plain, he wafts him to the Place where his Aſſiſtance is wanted. Juſt to the ſame Intent does this very Bark lie here; 'tis as clear as the Day, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, before it be too late, <hi>Sancho,</hi> tie up <hi>Rozinante</hi> and <hi>Dapple,</hi> let us commit our ſelves to the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Providence; for embark I will, though bare-footed Friars ſhould beg me to deſiſt. Well, well, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> if I muſt I muſt. Since you will every Foot run haring into theſe — I don't know how to call them, theſe confounded Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, I have no more to do but to make a Leg, and ſubmit my Neck to the Collar; for, as the Saying is, <hi>Do as thy Maſter bids thee, though it be to ſit down at his Table.</hi> But for all that, fall Back fall Edge, I muſt and will diſcharge my Conſcience, and tell you plainly, that, as blind as I am, I can ſee with Half an Eye, that it is no inchanted Bark, but
<pb n="900" facs="tcp:54446:487"/>
ſome Fiſherman's Boat; for there are many in this River, whoſe Waters afford the beſt Shads in the World. This Caution did <hi>Sancho</hi> give his Maſte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> while he was tying the Beaſts to a Tree, and going to leave them to the Protection of Inchanters, full ſore againſt his Will. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> bid him not be concern'd at leaving them there, for the Sage who was to carry 'em through in a Journey of ſuch an Extent and Longitude, would be ſure to take Care of the Animals. Nay, nay, as for that Matter, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I don't underſtand your Longitude, I never heard ſuch a cramp Word in my Born-days. Longitude, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> is the ſame as Length: I don't wonder that thou do'ſt not underſtand the Word, for thou'rt not oblig'd to underſtand <hi>Latin.</hi> Yet you ſhall have ſome forward Coxcombs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be knowing, when they are ignorant. Now the Beaſts are faſt Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> what's next to be done? Why now, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> let us recommend our ſelves to Providence and weigh Anchor, or to ſpeak plainly, embark, and cut the Cable. With that, leaping in, and <hi>Sancho</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he cut the Rope, and ſo by Degrees the Stream carry'd the Boat from the Shore. Now when <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> ſaw himſelf towards the Middle of the River, he began to quake for fear; but nothing griev'd his Heart ſo much as to hear <hi>Dapple</hi> bray, and to ſee <hi>Rozinante</hi> ſtruggle to get looſe. Sir, quoth he, hark how my poor <hi>Dapple</hi> brays, to bemoan ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Alack and alack! my poor dear Friends, Peace be with you where you are, and when this mad Freak, the Cauſe of our doleful parting, is ended in Repentance, may we be brought back to your ſweet Company again. This ſaid, he fell a blubbering, aed ſet up ſuch a Howl, that Don
<pb n="901" facs="tcp:54446:487"/>
                           <hi>Quixote</hi> had no Patience with him, but looking angrily on him, What doſt thou fear, cry'd he, thou great white-liver'd Calf? What doſt thou cry for? Who purſues thee? Who hurts thee, thou daſtardly Craven, thou Cowardly Mouſe, thou Soul of a Milk-ſop, thou Heart of Butter? Doſt want for any thing, baſe unſatisfy'd Wretch? What would'ſt thou ſay, wert thou to climb bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot the rugged Snowy <hi>Alps?</hi> Thou that ſitteſt here in State like an Archduke, Plenty and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light on each ſide of thee, whilſt thou glideſt gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly down the calm Current of this delightful River, which will ſoon convey us into the Main Ocean? We have already flow'd down ſome ſeven or eight hundred Leagues. Had I but an Aſtrolabe here to take the Latitude of the Pole, I could eaſily tell thee how far we have proceeded to an Inch: Tho' either I know but little, or we have juſt paſs'd, or ſhall preſently paſs the <hi>Equinoctial Line,</hi> that divides and ſets the two oppoſite Poles at an equal diſtance.</p>
                        <p>And when we come to this ſame <hi>Line</hi> you ſpeak of, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> how far have we gone then? A mighty way, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote.</hi> When we come under the Line I ſpoke of, we ſhall have meaſur'd the other half of the Terraqueous Globe, which according to the Syſtem and Computation of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> who was the greateſt Coſmographer in the World, contains three hundred and ſixty De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.

Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ſmil'd at <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Blunders, and going on, The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſaid he, and all thoſe that Embark at <hi>Cadiz</hi> for the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> to know whether they have paſs'd the Equinoctial Line, according to an Obſervation that
<pb n="902" facs="tcp:54446:488"/>
has been often experienc'd, need do no more than look whether there be any Lice left alive among the Ship's Crew; for if they have paſs'd it, not one is to be found in the Ship, though they would give his weight in Gold for him. Look therefore, <hi>Sancho,</hi> and if thou find'ſt any ſuch Vermin ſtill creeping about thee, then we have not yet paſs'd the Line; but if thou doſt not, then we have ſurely paſs'd it. The Devil a Word I believe of all this, quoth <hi>Sancho:</hi> However, I'll do as you bid me. But hark you me, Sir, now I think on't again, where's the need of trying theſe Quirks! Don't I ſee with my two Eyes that we are not five Rods length from the Shore? Look you there ſtands <hi>Rozinante</hi> and <hi>Dapple,</hi> upon the very ſpot where we left them; and now I look cloſely into the matter, I will take my Corporal Oath that we move no faſter than a Snail can Gallop, or an Ant can Trot. No more words, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> but make the Experiment as I bid you, and let the reſt alone. Thou doſt not know what belongs to Colures, Lines, Parallels, Zodiacks, Eclipticks, Poles, Solſtices, Equinoctials, Planets, Signs, Points, and Meaſures, of which the Spheres Celeſtial and Terreſtrial are compos'd; for didſt thou know all theſe things, or ſome of them at leaſt, thou might<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt plainly perceive what Parallels we have cut, what Signs we have paſs'd, and what Conſtella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we have left, and are now leaving behind us. Therefore I would wiſh thee once again to ſearch thy ſelf; for I cannot believe but thou art as clear from Vermin as a Sheet of white Paper. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Sancho</hi> advancing his Hand very gingerly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the left ſide of his Neck, after he had grop'd a while, lifted up his Head; and ſtaring in his Maſter's Face, look you Sir, quoth he, pulling out ſomething, either your Rule is not worth this,
<pb n="903" facs="tcp:54446:488"/>
or we are many a fair League from the place you ſpoke of. How! anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> haſt thou found ſomething then, <hi>Sancho?</hi> Ay, marry have I, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> and more things than one too, and ſo ſaying, he ſhook and ſnap'd his Fingers, and then dipp'd his whole Hand into the River; down whoſe Stream the Boat drove gently along, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being mov'd by any ſecret Influence or hidden Inchantment, but only by the help of the Current, hitherto calm and ſmooth.</p>
                        <p>By this time they deſcry'd two great Water-mills in the middle of the River, which Don <hi>Quixote</hi> no ſooner ſpy'd, but calling to his Squire, Look, look, my <hi>Sancho,</hi> cry'd he! ſee'ſt thou you City or Caſtle there! This is the Place where ſome Knight lies in Diſtreſs, or ſome Queen or Princeſs is detain'd, for whoſe Succour I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd hither. What a Devil do you mean with your City or Caſtle, cry'd <hi>Sancho?</hi> Body of me! Sir, don't you ſee as plain as the Noſe in your Face, they are nothing but Water-mills, in the midſt of the River, to grind Corn. Peace, <hi>Sancho,</hi> reply'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> they look like Water-mills I grant you, but they are no ſuch things: How often, have I not told thee already, do theſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians change and overturn every thing as they pleaſe, not that they can change their very Being, but they diſguiſe and alter the appearances of them; in which we have an Inſtance in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Transformation of <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> the only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge of my Hope.</p>
                        <p>The Boat being now got into the very ſtrength of the Stream, began to move leſs ſlowly than it did before. The People in the Mills perceiving the Boat to come a-drift full upon the Mill-wheels, came running out with their long Poles to ſtop it; and as their Faces and Cloaths were
<pb n="904" facs="tcp:54446:489"/>
Powder'd all over with Meal-duſt, they made a very odd Appearance. So-ho! there, cry'd they, as loud as they could bawl, is the Devil in the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows? Are ye mad in the Boat there? Hold! You'll be drown'd or Ground to pieces by the Mill-wheels. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> having caſt his Eyes on the Millers, did I not tell thee, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid he, that we ſhould arrive where I muſt exert the ſtrength of my Arm. Look what Hang-dogs, what horrid Wretches come forth to make Head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me! How many Hobgoblins oppoſe my Paſſage! Do but ſee what deform'd Phyſiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies they have, Meer Bug-bears! But I ſhall make ye know, Scoundrels, how inſignificant all your Efforts muſt prove. Then ſtanding up in the Boat, he began to threaten the Millers in a haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Tone. Ye paltry Slaves, cry'd he, baſe and ill-advis'd Scum of the World, releaſe inſtantly the Captive Perſon who is injuriouſly detain'd and Oppreſs'd within your Caſtle or Priſon, be he of high or low Degree; for I am Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> otherwiſe call'd the Knight of the Lions; for whom the happy Atchievement of this Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is reſerv'd, by the Decree of Heaven. This ſaid, he unſheath'd his Sword, and began to Fence with the Air, as if he had been already engaging the Millers, who hearing, but not underſtanding his mad Words, ſtood ready with their Poles to ſtop the Boat, which was now near the Mill-dam, and falling into the rapid Stream and narrow Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of the Wheels.</p>

                        <p>When they were both hawl'd a-ſhore, more over-drench'd than thirſty, <hi>Sancho</hi> betook himſelf to his Knees again, and with up-lifted Hands and Eyes made a long and hearty Prayer, that Heaven might keep him from this time forwards clear of his Maſter's Raſh Adventures.</p>
                        <p>And now came the Fiſher-men who own'd the Boat, and finding it broken to pieces, fell upon <hi>Sancho,</hi> and began to ſtrip him, demanding Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction both of him and his Maſter for the loſs of their Bark. The Knight with a great deal of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and Unconcern, as if he had done no manner of Harm, told both the Millers and the Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that he was ready to pay for the Boat, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they would fairly ſurrender the Perſons that were detain'd unjuſtly in their Caſtle. What Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or what Caſtle, you mad Oaf, ſaid one of the Millers? Marry guep, would you carry away the Folk that come to grind their Corn at our Mills? So, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> a Man had as good Preach to a Stone-wall as to expect to perſwade with Entreaties ſuch Dregs of Humane-kind to do a good and generous Action. Two Sage Inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters certainly claſh in this Adventure; and the one thwarts the other: One provided me a Bark, t'other overwhelm'd me in it. Heaven ſend us better Times! There is nothing but Plotting and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-plotting, Undermining and Counter-mining
<pb n="906" facs="tcp:54446:491"/>
in this World. Well, I can do no more. Then raiſing his Voice, and caſting a fix'd Eye on the Millers, Well! my dear Friends, cry'd he, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you are that are immur'd in this Priſon, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me, I beſeech ye; for ſo my ill Fate and yours Ordains, that I cannot free you from Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion: The Adventure is reſerv'd for ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Knight. This ſaid, he came to an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the Fiſher-men, and order'd <hi>Sancho</hi> to pay them fifty Reals for the Boat. <hi>Sancho</hi> pull'd out the Money with a very ill will, and parted with it with a worſe, muttering between his Teeth, that two Voyages like that would ſink their whole Stock.</p>
                        <p>The Fiſher-men and the Millers could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear admiring at two ſuch Figures of Humane Off-ſpring, that neither ſpoke nor acted like the reſt of Mankind: for they could not ſo much as gueſs what Don <hi>Quixote</hi> meant by all his Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Speeches; ſo taking them for Mad-men, they left 'em, and went, the Millers to their Mills, and the Fiſhermen to their Hutts. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> return'd to their Beaſts like a couple of as Senſeleſs Animals; and thus ended the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Inchanted Bark.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XXX.</hi> What happen'd to Don <hi>Quixote</hi> with the Fair Huntreſs.</head>
                        <p>WITH wet Bodies and Melancholick Minds, the Knight and Squire went back to <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zinante</hi> and <hi>Dapple;</hi> though <hi>Sancho</hi> was the more caſt down and out of Sorts of the two; for it griev'd him to the very Soul to ſee the Money dwindle; being as Chary of that as of his Heart's-Blood, or the Apples of his Eyes. To be ſhort, to Horſe they went without ſpeaking one Word to each other, and left the famous River: Don <hi>Quixote</hi> Bury'd in his Amorous Thoughts, and <hi>Sancho</hi> in thoſe of his Preferment, which he thought far enough off yet. For, as much a Fool as he was, he plainly perceiv'd that all or moſt of his Maſter's Actions were idle and ſilly: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he but waited an opportunity to give him the Slip, and go home without coming to any farther Reckoning, or taking a formal Leave. But For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune provided for him much better than he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
                        <p>It happen'd that the next Day about Sun-ſet as they were coming out of a Wood, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> caſt his Eyes round a Verdant Meadow, and at the farther end of it deſcry'd a Company, whom upon a nearer view he judg'd to be Perſons of Quality that were taking the Diverſion of Hawking; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching nearer yet, he obſerv'd among 'em a very fine Lady upon a white pacing Mare, in
<pb n="908" facs="tcp:54446:492"/>
green Trappings, and a Saddle of Cloath of Silver. The Lady her ſelf was dreſs'd in Green, ſo Rich and ſo Gay, that nothing could be finer. She rode with a Goſs-hawk on her left Fiſt, by which Don <hi>Quixote</hi> judg'd her to be of Quality, and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of the Train that attended; as indeed ſhe was. Thereupon calling to his Squire, Son <hi>Sancho,</hi> cry'd he, Run and tell that Lady on the Palfrey with the Goſs-hawk on her Fiſt, that I the Knight of the Lions humbly ſalute her Highneſs, and that if ſhe pleaſes to give me leave, I ſhould be proud to receive her Commands, and have the Honour of waiting on her, and kiſſing her fair Hands. But take ſpecial care, <hi>Sancho,</hi> how thou delivereſt thy Meſſage, and be ſure don't Lard my Compliment with any of your old Sawe. Why this to me, quoth <hi>Sancho?</hi> Marry you need not talk of Lard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as if I had never went Ambaſſador before to a High and Mighty Dame. I don't know that ever thou did'ſt, reply'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> at leaſt on my Account, unleſs it were when I ſent thee to <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinea.</hi> It may be ſo, quoth <hi>Sancho:</hi> But a good Pay-maſter needs no Surety; and where there's Plenty, the Gueſts can't be empty. That is to ſay, I need none of your telling nor tutoring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that matter; for, as ſilly as I look, I know ſomething of every thing. Well, well, I believe it ſaid Don <hi>Quixote.</hi> Go then in a good Hour, and Heaven Inſpire and Guide thee.</p>

                           <hi>Sancho</hi> put on, forcing <hi>Dapple</hi> from his old Pace to a Gallop; and approaching the fair Huntreſs, he alighted, and falling on his Knees; Fair Lady quoth he, that Knight yonder, call'd the Knight of the Lions, is my Maſter, I am his Squire, <hi>Sancho Pança</hi> by Name. This ſame Knight of the Lions, who but t'other day was call'd the Knight of the Woeful Figure, has ſent me to tell you, That ſo
<pb n="909" facs="tcp:54446:492"/>
pleaſe your Worſhip's Grace to give him leave with your good liking to do as he has a mind, which, as he ſays, and as I believe, is only to Serve your high-flown Beauty, and be your ternal Vaſſal, you may chance to do a thing that will be for your own good, and he will take it for a huge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous kindneſs at your Hands. Indeed, honeſt Squire, ſaid the Lady, you have acquitted your ſelf of your Charge with all the graceful Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which ſuch an Embaſſy requires: Riſe, pray riſe, for 'tis by no means fit the Squire to ſo great a Knight, as the Knight of the Woeful Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, to whoſe Name and Merits we are no Strangers, ſhould remain on his Knees. Riſe then, and deſire your Maſter by all means to honour us with his Company, that my Lord Duke and I may pay him our Reſpects at a Houſe we have hard by.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sancho</hi> got up, no leſs amaz'd at the Lady's Beauty, than at her Affability, but much more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe told him they were no Strangers to his Maſter the Knight of the Woeful Figure. Nor did he wonder why ſhe did not call him by his Title of Knight of the Lions; conſidering, he had but lately aſſum'd it.</p>
                        <p>Pray (ſaid the Dutcheſs, whoſe particular Title we don't yet know) is not this Maſter of yours the Perſon, whoſe Hiſtory came out in Print, by the Name of <hi>the Renowned</hi> Don <hi>Quixote de la Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha,</hi> the Miſtreſs of whoſe Affections is a certain Lady call'd <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo?</hi> The very ſame, an't pleaſe your Worſhip, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> and that Squire of his that is, or ſhould be in the Book, <hi>Sancho Pança</hi> by Name, is my own ſelf, if I was not chang'd in my Cradle; I mean, chang'd in the Preſs. I am mighty glad to hear all this, ſaid the Dutcheſs. Go then, Friend <hi>Pança,</hi> and tell your
<pb n="910" facs="tcp:54446:493"/>
Maſter, That I congratulate him upon his arrival in our Territories, to which he is welcome, and aſſure him from me, that this is the moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able News I could poſſibly have heard.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sancho,</hi> over-joy'd with this gracious Anſwer, return'd to his Maſter, to whom he repeated all that the great Lady had ſaid to him; praiſing to the Skies, in his Clowniſh Phraſe, her great Beauty, and Courteous Nature.</p>
                        <p>Don <hi>Quixote</hi> pleas'd with this good beginning, ſeated himſelf handſomely in the Saddle, fix'd his Toes in his Stirrups, ſet the Bever of his Helmet as he thought beſt became his Face, rous'd up <hi>Rozinante</hi>'s Mettle, and with a graceful aſſurance mov'd forwards to kiſs the Dutcheſs's Hand. As ſoon as <hi>Sancho</hi> went from her, ſhe ſent for the Duke her Husband, and gave him an account of Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Embaſſy. Thereupon they both attended his coming with a pleaſant Impatience; for, having read the firſt Part of his Hiſtory, they were no leſs deſirous to be acquainted with his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and reſolv'd, as long as he ſtay'd with them, to give him his own Way, and Humour him in all things, treating him ſtill with all the Forms Eſſential to the Entertainment of a Knight-Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; which they were the better able to do, having been much converſant with Books of that kind.</p>
                        <p>And now Don <hi>Quixote</hi> drew nigh with his Vizor up; and <hi>Sancho</hi> ſeeing him offer to alight, made all the haſte he could to be ready to hold his Stirrup: But, as Ill-luck would have it, as he was throwing his Leg over his Pack-Saddle to get off, he entangl'd his Leg ſo ſtrangely in the Rope, that ſerv'd him inſtead of a Stirrup, that not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to get his Foot out, he hung by the Heel with his Noſe to the Ground. On the other Side.
<pb n="911" facs="tcp:54446:493"/>
Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> who was us'd to have his Stirrup held when he diſmounted, thinking <hi>Sancho</hi> had hold of it already, lifted up his right Leg over the Saddle to alight; but as it happen'd to be ill-girt, down he brought it with himſelf to the Ground, confounded with Shame, and muttering between his Teeth many a hearty Curſe againſt <hi>Sancho,</hi> who was all the while with his Foot in the Stocks. The Duke ſeeing 'em in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, order'd ſome of his People to help 'em; and they rais'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> who was in no very good Caſe with his Fall; however, limping as well as he could, he went to pay his Duty to the Lady, and would have fall'n on his Knees at her Horſe's Feet: But the Duke alighting, would by no means permit it, and embracing Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> I am ſorry, ſaid he, Sir Knight of <hi>the Woeful Figure,</hi> that ſuch a Miſchance ſhould happen to you at your firſt coming on my Ground; but the Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of Squires is often the cauſe of worſe Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. Moſt generous Prince, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> I can think nothing bad that could befal me here, ſince I have had the happineſs of ſeeing your Grace: For though I had fallen low as the very Center, the Glory of this Interview would raiſe me up again. My Squire indeed, a Vengeance ſeize him for't, is much more apt to give his Saucy Idle Tongue a Looſe, than to gird a Saddle well; but Proſtrate or Erect, on Horſe-back or on Foot, in any Poſture I ſhall always be at your Grace's Command, and no leſs at her Grace's, your worthy Conſort's Service. Worthy did I ſay, yes, ſhe is worthy to be call'd the Queen of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Soveraign Lady of all Courteſy. Pardon me there, ſaid the Duke, Noble Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha;</hi> where the Peerleſs <hi>Dulcinea</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membr'd,
<pb n="912" facs="tcp:54446:494"/>
the Praiſe of all other Beauties ought to be forgot.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sancho</hi> was now got clear of the Nooſe, and ſtanding near the Dutcheſs, an't pleaſe your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Highneſs, quoth he, before his Maſter could anſwer, it can't be deny'd, nay, I dare vouch it in any Ground in <hi>Spain,</hi> that my Lady <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo</hi> is woundy Handſome and fair: But <hi>where we leaſt think, there ſtarts the Hare.</hi> I've heard your great Scholards ſay, That ſhe you call Dame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is like a Potter, and he that makes one hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Pipkin may make two or three hundred. And ſo, d'ye ſee, you may underſtand by this, that my Lady Dutcheſs here does not a jot come ſhort of my Lady <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo.</hi> Don <hi>Quixote</hi> upon this addreſſing himſelf to the Dutcheſs, Your Grace muſt know, ſaid he, that no Knight-Errant ever had ſuch an eternal Babbler, ſuch a bundle of Conceit for a Squire, as I have; and if I have the honour to continue for ſome time in your Service, your Grace will find it true. I am glad, anſwer'd the Dutcheſs, that honeſt <hi>Sancho</hi> has his Conceits, its a ſhrew'd ſign he is wiſe; for merry Conceits, you know, Sir, are not the Off-ſprings of a dull Brain, and therefore if <hi>Sancho</hi> be jovial and jocoſe, I'll warrant him alſo a Man of Senſe. And a Prater, Madam, added Don <hi>Quixote.</hi> So much the better, ſaid the Duke; for a Man that talks well, can never talk too much. But not to loſe our time here, Come on, Sir Knight of the Woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Figure,—Knight of the Lions, your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould ſay, quoth <hi>Sancho:</hi> The Woeful Figure is out of date; and ſo pray let the Lions come in play. Well then, ſaid the Duke, I entreat the Knight of the Lions to vouchſafe us his Preſence at a Caſtle I have hard by, where he ſhall find ſuch Entertainment as is juſtly due to ſo eminent
<pb n="913" facs="tcp:54446:494"/>
a Perſonage, ſuch Honours as the Dutcheſs and my ſelf are wont to pay to all Knight-Errants that travel this Way.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sancho</hi> having by this got <hi>Rozinante</hi> ready, and girded the Saddle tight, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> mounted his Steed, and the Duke a ſtately Horſe of his own; and the Dutcheſs riding between 'em both, they mov'd towards the Caſtle: She deſir'd that <hi>Sancho</hi> might always attend near her, for ſhe was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely taken with his notable Sayings; <hi>Sancho</hi> was not hard to be entreated, but crowded in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 'em, and made a fourth in their Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Duke and the Dutcheſs were very well ſatisfied, eſteeming themſelves very fortunate in having an Opportunity to entertain at their Caſtle ſuch a Knight-Errant and ſuch an erring Squire.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>SAncho</hi> was over-joy'd to find himſelf ſo much in the Dutcheſs's Favour, flattering himſelf that he ſhou'd fare no worſe at her Caſtle than he had done at Don <hi>Diego</hi>'s and <hi>Baſil</hi>'s Houſes; for he was ever a Cordial Friend to a plentiful way of Living, and therefore never fail'd to take Opportunity by the Fore-top, where-ever he met her. Now the Hiſtory tells us, that before they got to the Caſtle, the Duke rode away from them, to inſtruct his Servants how to behave themſelves toward Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> ſo that no ſooner did the Knight come near the Gates, but he was met by
<pb n="914" facs="tcp:54446:495"/>
two of the Duke's Lacquies or Grooms in long Veſts like Night-Gowns of fine Crimſon-Sattin. Theſe ſuddenly took him in their Arms, and lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him from his Horſe without any further Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, go great and mighty Sir, ſaid they, and help my Lady Dutcheſs down. Thereupon Don <hi>Quixote</hi> went and offer'd to do it; and many Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments, and much Ceremony paſs'd on both ſides; but in Concluſion, the Dutcheſs's earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs prevail'd; for ſhe wou'd not alight from her Palfry but in the Arms of her Husband, excuſing her ſelf from incommoding ſo great a Knight with ſo inſignificant a Burden. With that the Duke took her down. And now, being enter'd into a large Court-yard, there came two Beautiful Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels who threw a long Mantle of fine Scarlet over Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Shoulders. In an inſtant all the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries about the Court-yard were crouded with Men and Women, the Domeſticks of the Duke, who cry'd out, Welcome, Welcome, the Flower and Cream of Knight-Errantry! Then moſt, if not all of 'em, ſprinkl'd whole Bottles of ſweet Water upon Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> the Duke and the Dutcheſs. This uſage agreeably ſurpriz'd the Don, and this was indeed the firſt Day he knew aad firmly believ'd himſelf to be a Real Knight-Errant, and that his Knighthood was more than Fancy; finding himſelf Treated juſt as he had read the Brothers of the Order were entertain'd in former Ages.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sancho</hi> was ſo tranſported, that he even forſook his beloved <hi>Dapple,</hi> to keep cloſe to the Dutcheſs, and enter'd the Caſtle with the Company. But his Conſcience flying in his Face for leaving that dear Companion of his alone, he went to a reverend old <hi>Duena</hi> who was one of the Dutcheſs's Retinue, and Whiſpering her in the Ear, Mrs. <hi>Gonſales,</hi> or
<pb n="915" facs="tcp:54446:495"/>
Mrs—Pray forſooth may I crave your Name? <hi>Donna Rodriguez, de Grijalva</hi> is my Name, ſaid the old Waiting-woman, What is your Buſineſs with me, Friend? Pray now, Miſtreſs, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> do ſo much as go out at the Caſtle-Gate, where you'll find a <hi>Dapple</hi> Aſs of mine; ſee him put into the Stable, or elſe put him in your ſelf; for, poor thing, 'tis main fearful and timerſome, and can't abide to be alone in a ſtrange Place. If the Maſter, ſaid ſhe pettiſhly, has no more Manners than the Man, we ſhall have a fine time on't. Get you gone, you ſaucy Jack, the Devil take thee and him that brought you hither, to affront me. Go ſeek ſomewhere elſe for Ladies to look to your Aſs, you Lollpoop! I'd have you to know, that Gentlewomen like me are not us'd to ſuch Drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries. Don't take Pepper in your Noſe at it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> you need not be ſo frumpiſh, Miſtreſs. As good as you have don't. I have heard my Maſter ſay (and he knows all the Hiſtories in the World) that when Sir <hi>Lancelot</hi> came out of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> Damſels look'd after him, and Waiting-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men after his Horſe. Now by my Troth! whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you believe it or no, I wou'd not ſwop my Aſs for Sir <hi>Lancelot</hi>'s Horſe, I'll tell you that. I think the Fool rides the Fellow, quoth the Wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-woman: Hark you, Friend, if you be a Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foon, keep your ſtuff for thoſe Chapmen that will bid you fairer. I wou'd not give a Fig for all the Jeſts in your Budget. Well enough yet, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> and a Fig for you too, an' you go to that: Adad! ſhou'd I take thee for a Fig. I might be ſure of a ripe one, your Fig's rotten Ripe, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth; ſay no more; if ſixty's the Game, you're a Peep out. You Raſcally Son of a Whore, cry'd the Waiting-woman in a pelting Chafe, whether I am Old or no, Heaven beſt knows, I ſhan't
<pb n="916" facs="tcp:54446:496"/>
ſtand to give an Account to ſuch a Raggamuffin as thou, thou Garlick-eating Stinkard. She ſpoke this ſo loud, that the Dutcheſs overheard her, and ſeeing the Woman ſo alter'd and as red as Fire, ask'd what was the matter? Why, Madam, ſaid the Waiting-woman, here's a Fellow wou'd ha' me put his Aſs in the Stable, telling me an idle Story of Ladies that look'd after one <hi>Lancelot,</hi> and Waiting-women after his Horſe; and becauſe I won't be his Oſtler, the Rake-ſhame very civilly calls me Old. Old, ſaid the Dutcheſs, that's an Affront no Woman can well bear. You are miſtaken, honeſt <hi>Sancho, Rodriguez</hi> is very Young, and the long Vail ſhe wears is more for Authority and Faſhion-ſake than upon account of her Years. May there be ne'er a good one in all thoſe I've to live, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> if I meant her any Harm, only I've ſuch a natural Love for my Aſs, an't like your Worſhip, that I thought I cou'd not recommend the poor Titt to a more Charitable Body than this ſame Madam <hi>Rodriguez. Sancho,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> with a ſower Look, do's this talk befit this place? D'you know where you are? Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> every Man muſt tell his Wants, be he where he will. Here I bethought my ſelf of <hi>Dapple,</hi> and here I ſpoke of him: Had I call'd him to mind in the Stable, I wou'd have ſpoken of him there.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sancho</hi> has reaſon on his ſide, ſaid the Duke; and no Body ought to chide him for it. But let him take no further care, <hi>Dapple</hi> ſhall have as much Provender as he will eat, and be us'd as well as <hi>Sancho</hi> himſelf.</p>
                        <p>Theſe ſmall Jars being over, which yielded Diverſion to all the Company, except Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> he was led up a ſtately Stair-caſe, and then into a noble Hall, ſumptuouſly hung with rich Gold-Brocade. There his Armour was taken off by ſix
<pb n="917" facs="tcp:54446:496"/>
Young Damſels, that ſerv'd him inſtead of Pages, all of 'em fully inſtructed by the Duke and Dutcheſs, how to behave themſelves ſo towards Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> that he might look on his Entertainment as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to thoſe which the Famous Knight-Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants receiv'd of Old.</p>
                        <p>When he was unarm'd, he appear'd in his cloſe Breeches, and Shamoy-doublet, raw-boned and meagre, tall and lank, with a pair of Lantern-Jaws that met i'the middle of his Mouth; in ſhort, he made ſo very odd a Figure, that notwithſtanding the ſtrict Injunction the Duke had laid on the Young Females who waited on him, to ſtifle their Laughter, they were hardly able to contain. They deſir'd he would give 'em leave to take off his Cloaths, and put him on a clean Shirt. But he would by no Means permit, giving 'em to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, That Modeſty was as commendable a Vertue in a Knight as Valour; and therefore he deſir'd them to leave the Shirt with <hi>Sancho,</hi> and then retiring to an adjacent Chamber where there was a rich Bed, he lock'd himſelf up with his Squire, pull'd off his Cloaths, ſhifted himſelf, and then while they were alone he began to take him to Task.</p>
                        <p>Now, ſaid he, modern Buffoon and Jolter-head of old, what can'ſt thou ſay for thy ſelf? Where learned you to abuſe ſuch a Venerable Ancient Gentlewoman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one ſo worthy of Reſpect as <hi>Donna Rodriguez?</hi> Was that a proper time to think of your <hi>Dapple?</hi> Or can you think Perſons of Quality who nobly Entertain the Maſters, forget to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for their Beaſts? For Heavens ſake, <hi>Sancho,</hi> mend thy Behaviour, and don't betray thy home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpun Breeding, leſt thou be thought a ſcandal to thy Maſter Doſt not thou know, ſaucy Ruſtick, that the World often makes an Eſtimate of the Maſter's Diſcretion by that of his Servants,
<pb n="918" facs="tcp:54446:497"/>
and that one of the moſt conſiderable advantages the Great have over their Inferiours, is to have Servants as good as themſelves? Art thou not ſenſible, pitiful Fellow as thou art, the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy I, that if they find thee a groſs Clown, or a Mad Buffoon, they will take me for ſome Hedge-Knight or palltry ſhifting Rook? Prithee, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, dear <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſhun theſe Inconveniencies; for he that aims too much at Jeſts and Drolling, is apt to trip and tumble, and is at laſt deſpis'd as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid ridiculous Buffoon. Then curb thy Tongue, think well, and ponder thy Words before they get looſe; and take notice, we are come to a place whence by the Aſſiſtance of Heaven, and the Force of this puiſſant Arm, we may depart better'd five to one in Fortune and Reputation. <hi>Sancho</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd him to behave himſelf better for the future, and to ſow up his Mouth or bite out his Tongue, rather than ſpeak one Word which was not duly conſider'd, and to the purpoſe; ſo that his Maſter need not fear any one ſhou'd find out what they were. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> then dreſs'd himſelf, put on his Belt and Sword, threw his Scarlet-Cloak over his Shoulders, and clapt on a Monteer-Cap of Green Velvet, which had been left him by the Damſels. Thus accoutr'd he enter'd the State-Room, where he found the Damſels rang'd in two rows, attending with Water, and all Neceſſaries to waſh in State; and having done him that Office, with many humble Court'ſies and ſolemn Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, immediately twelve Pages with the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Sewer at the Head of 'em, came to conduct him to Supper, letting him know that the Duke and Dutcheſs expected him. Accordinly, they led 'em in great Pomp, ſome walking before and ſome behind, into another Room, where a Table was magnificently ſet out for four People.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="919" facs="tcp:54446:497"/>As ſoon as he approach'd, the Duke and the Dutcheſs came as far as the Door to receive him, and with them a grave Clergy-man, one of thoſe that aſſume to govern Great Men's Houſes, and who, not being nobly born themſelves, don't know how to inſtruct thoſe that are, but wou'd have the Liberality of the Great meaſur'd by the narrowneſs of their own Souls, making thoſe whom they govern ſtingy, when they pretend to teach 'em Frugality. One of theſe in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, was this grave Eccleſiaſtick who came with the Duke to receive Don <hi>Quixote.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>After a thouſand Courtly Compliments on all ſides, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> at laſt approach'd the Table, between the Duke and the Dutcheſs, and here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe a freſh Conteſt; for the Knight, being offer'd the Upper end of the Table, thought himſelf oblig'd to decline it. However, he cou'd not withſtand the Duke's preſſing Importunities, but was forc'd at laſt to comply. The Parſon ſat right againſt him, and the Duke and the Dutcheſs on each ſide.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sancho</hi> ſtood by all the while, gaping with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſee the Honour done his Maſter; and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving how many Ceremonies paſs'd, and what Entreaties the Duke us'd to prevail with him to ſit at the Upper end of the Table: With your Worſhip's good leave, quoth he, I'll tell you what happen'd once i'our Town, in reference to this ſtir and ado that you've had now about Places. The Words were ſcarce out of his Mouth, when Don <hi>Quixote</hi> began to tremble, as having reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he was going to throw up ſome impertinent thing or other. <hi>Sancho</hi> had his Eyes upon him, and preſently underſtanding his Motions, Sir, quoth he, don't fear; I won't be Unmannerly, I warrant you. I'll ſpeak nothing, but what ſhall be
<pb n="920" facs="tcp:54446:498"/>
pat to the purpoſe: I han't ſo ſoon forgot the Leſſon you gave me about talking Senſe or Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe, little and much. I don't know what thou mean'ſt, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> ſay what thou wilt, ſo thou ſay'ſt it but quickly. Well, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> what I am going to tell you is every tittle true. Shou'd I trip never ſo little in my Story, my Maſter is here to take me up, and give me the Lie. Prithee, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> lie as much as thou wilt, for all me. I won't be thy hindrance. But take heed what thou ſay'ſt. Nay, nay, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> let me alone for that: I have heeded it and re-heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it over and over, and that you ſhall ſee— I warrant you. Truly, my Lord, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> it were convenient, that your Grace ſhou'd order this Fellow to be turn'd out of the Room; for he will plague you with a thouſand Impertinences. Oh! as for that you muſt excuſe me, ſaid the Dutcheſs; <hi>Sancho</hi> muſt not ſtir a ſtep from me; I'll engage for him, he ſhall ſay nothing, but what's very proper. Many and many proper Years, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> may your Holineſs live, Madam Dutcheſs, for your Good Opinion of me; tho' 'tis more your Goodneſs than my Deſerts. Now then for my Tale.</p>
                        <p>Once upon a time a Gentleman in our Town, of a good Eſtate, and Family, for he was of the Blood of the <hi>Alamos</hi> of <hi>Medina del Campo,</hi> and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried one <hi>Donna Mencia de Quinones,</hi> who was the Daughter of Don <hi>Alonzo de Maramon,</hi> a Knight of the Order of St. <hi>Jago,</hi> the very ſame that was drown'd in the <hi>Herradura,</hi> about whom that Quarrel happen'd formerly in our Town, in which I heard ſay, that my Maſter Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broil'd, and little <hi>Tom,</hi> the Mad-Cap, who was the Son of Old <hi>Balvaſtro</hi> the Farrier, happen'd to be ſorely hurt— Is not all this true now,

Maſter? Speak the Truth and ſhame the Devil, that their Worſhips Graces may know that I am neither a Prater nor a Lyar. Thus far, ſaid the Clergy man, I think thou are the firſt rather than the latter; I can't tell what I ſhall make of thee by and by. Thou produceſt ſo many Witneſſes, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and mention'ſt ſo many Circumſtances, that I muſt needs own, I believe what thou ſay'ſt to be true. But go on, and ſhorten the Story; for as thou beginneſt, I'm afraid thou'lt not have done theſe two Days. Pray don't let him ſhorten it, ſaid the Dutcheſs: Let him go his own way, tho he were not to make an end theſe ſix Days: I'll hear him with Pleaſure, and think the time as pleaſantly employ'd as any I ever paſs'd in my Life.—I ſay then, my Maſters, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that this ſame Gentleman I told you of at firſt, and I know him as well as I know my right Hand from my left, for 'tis not a Bow-ſhot from my Houſe to his; this Gentleman invited a Husbandman to Dine with him, who was a Poor Man, but main Honeſt—On, Friend, ſaid the Chaplain, at the rate you proceed, you won't have made an end before you come to t'other World. I ſhall ſtop ſhort of half way, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> and it be Heaven's bleſſed Will: A little more of your Chriſtian Patience, good Doctor! Now this ſame Husbandman, as I ſaid before, coming to this ſame Gentleman's Houſe, who had given him the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation, Heaven reſt his Soul, Poor Heart! For he's now dead and gone, and more than that, they ſay he dy'd the Death of an Angel. For my part, I was not by him when he dy'd; for I was gone to Harveſt-Work, at that very time, to a place call'd <hi>Trembleque.</hi> As you love your Life, Friend, ſaid the Clergy-man, leave your Reaping, come back quickly from <hi>Trembleque,</hi> without ſtaying to
<pb n="922" facs="tcp:54446:499"/>
bury the Gentleman, unleſs you've a Mind to make more Funerals; and pray make an end of your Story.—You muſt know then, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that as they two were ready to ſit down at Table— I mean the Husbandman and the Gentleman—Methinks I ſee them now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Eyes plainer than ever I did in my born Days. The Duke and the Dutcheſs were infinitely pleas'd to find how <hi>Sancho</hi> ſpun out his Story, and how the Clergy-man fretted at his Prolixity, and Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ſpent himſelf with Anger and Vexation. Well, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> to go on with my Story, when they were going to ſit down, the Husbandman wou'd not ſit till the Gentleman had taken his place; but the Gentleman made him a ſign to put himſelf at the Upper-end. <hi>By no means,</hi> Sir, quoth the Husbandman. <hi>Sit down</hi> ſaid t'other. <hi>Good your Worſhip,</hi> quoth the Husbandman— <hi>Sit where I bid thee,</hi> ſaid the Gentleman. Still the other excus'd himſelf, and would not, and the Gentleman told him, he ſhould, as meaning to be Maſter in his own Houſe. But the over-manner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lolpoop, fancying he ſhould be huge well Bred and Civil in it, ſcrap'd and cring'd and refus'd; till at laſt the Gentleman, in a great Paſſion e'en took him by the Shoulders and forc'd him into the Chair. Sit there, Clod-pate, cry'd he, for let me ſit where-ever I will, that ſtill will be the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-end, and the place of Worſhip to thee. And now you have my Tale, and I think I ha' ſpoke nothing but what's to the purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Face was in a thouſand Colours that ſpeckl'd its natural Brown; ſo that the Duke and the Dutcheſs were obliged to Check their Mirth, when they perceiv'd <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Roguery, that Don <hi>Quixote</hi> might not be put too much out of Countenance. And therefore to turn the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
<pb n="923" facs="tcp:54446:499"/>
that <hi>Sancho</hi> might not run into other Fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries, the Dutcheſs ask'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> what News he had of the Lady <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> and how long it was ſince he had ſent her any Giants or Robbers for a Preſent, not doubting but that he had lately ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd many ſuch? Alaſs! Madam, anſwer'd he, my Misfortunes have had a beginning, but they will never have an end. I have vanquiſh'd Giants, Elves and Cuthroats, and ſent them to the Miſtreſs of my Soul, but where ſhall they find her? She is Inchanted, Madam, and Transform'd to the uglieſt Piece of Ruſticity that can be imagin'd. I don't know, Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> when I ſaw her laſt, ſhe ſeem'd to be the fineſt Creature in the Varſal World; thus far at leaſt I can ſafely vouch for her upon my own Knowledge, that for Activity of Body, and leaping, the beſt Tumbler of 'em all does not go beyond her. Upon my honeſt Word, Madam Dutcheſs, ſhe'll Vault from the Ground upon her Aſs like a Cat. Have you ſeen her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted, ſaid the Duke? Seen her, quoth <hi>Sancho!</hi> And who the Devil was the firſt that hit upon this Trick of her Inchantment, think you, but I? She is as much Inchanted as my Father.</p>
                        <p>The Church-man hearing 'em talk of Giants, Elves, and Inchantments, began to ſuſpect this was Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> whoſe Hiſtory the Duke ſo often us'd to Read, tho' he had ſeveral times reprehended him for it, telling him 'twas a Folly to Read ſuch Follies. Being confirm'd in his Suſpicion, he addreſs'd himſelf very angrily to the Duke. My Lord, ſaid he, your Grace will have a large account to give one Day for Pamper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Poor Man's Follies. I ſuppoſe this ſame Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> or Don <hi>Quite Sot,</hi> or whatever you are pleas'd to call him, cannot be quite ſo beſotted as you endeavour to make him, by giving him ſuch
<pb n="924" facs="tcp:54446:500"/>
Opportunities to run on in his Fantaſtical Humours. Then directing his Diſcourſe to Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> Hark ye, ſaid he, Good-man Addle-pate, who has put it into your Crown that you are a Knight-Errant, that you vanquiſh Giants and Robbers? Go, go, get you home again, look after your Children, if you have any, and what honeſt Buſineſs you have to do, and leave wandring about the World, build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Caſtles in the Air, and making your ſelf a Laughing-ſtock, to all that know you or know you not. Where have you found, in the Name of Miſchief, that there ever has been or are now any ſuch Things as Knight-Errants? Where will you meet with Giants in <hi>Spain,</hi> or Monſters in <hi>La Mancha?</hi> Where ſhall one find your inchanted <hi>Dulcinea</hi>'s, and all thoſe Legions of Whimſies and Chimera's that are talk'd of on your Account, but in your empty Scull?</p>
                        <p>Don <hi>Quixote</hi> gave this reverend Perſon the hearing, liſtening with great Patience to his ſevere Reproof. At laſt, ſeeing him Silent, without minding his Reſpect to the Duke and Dutcheſs, up he ſtarted with Indignation and Fury in his Looks, and ſaid—But his Anſwer deſerves a whole Chapter by it ſelf.</p>

                        <p>DON <hi>Quixote</hi> being thus ſuddenly got up, ſhaking from head to Foot for Madneſs, as if he had Quick-ſilver in his Bones, caſt an angry look on his indiſcreet Cenſor, and with an eager delivery, ſputtering and ſtammering with Choler, This Place, cry'd he, the Preſence of theſe Noble Perſons, and the Reſpect I have always had for your Function, check my juſt Reſentment, and tie up my Hands from taking the Satisfaction of a Gentleman. For theſe Reaſons, and ſince every one knows that you Gown-men, as well as Women, uſe no other Weapon but your Tongues, I'll fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engage you upon equal Terms, and Combat you at your own Weapon. I ſhould rather have expected ſober Admonitions from a Man of your Character, than infamous Reproaches. Charitable and wholeſom Correction ought to be manag'd at another rate, and with more Moderation. The leaſt that can be ſaid of this Reproof which you've given me here ſo bitterly, and in Publick, is, that it has exceeded the bounds of Chriſtian Correction, and a gentle one had been much more becoming, Is it fit that without any inſight into the Offence which you reprove, you ſhould without any more ado call the Offender Fool, Sot, and Addle-pate? Pray Sir, what Fooliſh Action have you ſeen me do, that ſhould provoke you to give me ſuch ill
<pb n="926" facs="tcp:54446:501"/>
Language, and bid me ſo Magiſtratically go home to look after my Wife and Children, before you knew whether I have any? Don't you think thoſe deſerve as ſevere a Cenſure who ſcrew themſelves into other Men's Houſes, and pretend to Rule the Maſter? A fine World 'tis truly, when a poor Pedant, who has ſeen no more of it than lies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in twenty or thirty Leagues about him, ſhall take upon him to preſcribe Laws to Knight-Errantry, and judge of thoſe who profeſs it! You, forſooth, eſteem it an idle Undertaking, and Time loſt to wander through the World, though ſcorning its Pleaſures, and ſharing the hardſhips and toils of it, by which the Vertuous aſpire to the high Seat of Immortality. If Perſons of Honour, Knights, Lords, Gentlemen, or Men of any Birth, ſhould take me for a Fool or a Coxcomb, I ſhould think it an irreparable Affront. But for meer Scholars that never trod the Paths of Chivalry, to think me mad, I deſpiſe and laugh at it. I am a Knight, and a Knight will I die, if ſo it pleaſe Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. Some chuſe the high Road of haughty Ambition, others the low ways of baſe ſervile Flattery, a third ſort take the crooked Path of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Hypocriſy, and a few, very few, that of true Religion. I for my own part, guided by my Stars, follow the narrow Track of Knight-Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantry; and for the Exerciſe of it, I deſpiſe Riches, but not Honour. I have redreſs'd Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, and righted the Injur'd, chaſtis'd the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent, vanquiſh'd Giants, and trod Elves and Hobgoblins under my Feet! I am in Love, but no more than the Profeſſion of Knight-Errantry obliges me to be; yet I am none of this Age's Vicious Lovers, but a chaſte Platonick. My In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions are all directed to Vertuous Ends, and to do no Man wrong, but good to all the World.
<pb n="927" facs="tcp:54446:501" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And now let your Graces judge, moſt excellent Duke and Dutcheſs, whether a Perſon who makes it his only Study to practiſe all this, deſerves to be upbraided for a Fool.</p>
                        <p>Well ſaid, I'faith! quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> ſay no more for your ſelf, my good Lord and Maſter; ſtop when you're well; for there's not the leaſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be added more on your ſide, either in Word Thought, or Deed. Beſides, ſince Mr. Parſon has had the Face to ſay point-blank, as one may ſay, That there neither are, nor ever were any Knight-Errants in the World, no mar'l he does not know what he ſays. What! ſaid the Clergyman, I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant you are that <hi>Sancho Pança,</hi> to whom they ſay your Maſter has promis'd an Iſland? Ay, marry am I, anſwer'd <hi>Sancho;</hi> and I am he that deſerves it as well as another Body; and I am one of thoſe of whom they ſay, <hi>keep with good Men and thou ſhalt be one of them;</hi> and of thoſe of whom 'tis ſaid agen, <hi>not with whom thou wert bred, but with whom thou haſt fed; and lean againſt a good Tree, and it will ſhelter thee.</hi> I have lean'd and ſtuck cloſe to my good Maſter, and kept him Company this many a Month; and now he and I are all one; and I muſt be as he is, an't be Heaven's bleſſed Will; live he, and I ſhall live. He ſhan't want King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms to Rule, nor ſhall I want Iſlands to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern.</p>
                        <p>That thou ſhalt not, honeſt <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid the Duke; for I on the great Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Account will now give thee the Government of an odd one of my own of no ſmall Conſequence. Down, down on thy Knees, <hi>Sancho,</hi> cry'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and kiſs his Grace's Feet for this Favour. <hi>Sancho</hi> did accordingly: But when the Clergyman ſaw it, he got up in a great beat. By the Habit which I wear, cry'd he, I can ſcarce forbear telling your
<pb n="928" facs="tcp:54446:502"/>
Grace, that you are as mad as theſe Sinful Wretches. Well may they be mad, when Wiſe Men Humour and Canonize their Frenzy; you may keep 'em here and ſtay with 'em your ſelf, if your Grace pleaſes; but for my part I'll leave you and go home, to excuſe my ſelf from reprehending what I can't remedy. With that, leaving the reſt of his Dinner behind him, away he flung; the Duke and the Dutcheſs not being able to pacify him: Though indeed the Duke could not ſay much to him, for laughing at his impertient Paſſion. When he had done Laughing, Sir Knight of the Lions, ſaid he, you've anſwer'd ſo well for your ſelf, and your Profeſſion, that you need no farther Satisfaction of the Angry Clergy-man, eſpecially if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that whatever he might ſay, it was not in his power to fix an Affront on a Perſon of your Character, ſince Women and Church-men cannot give an Affront. Very true, My Lord, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and the Reaſon is, becauſe he that cannot receive an Affront, conſequently can give none. Women, Children and Church-men, as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Vindicate themſelves when they are Injur'd, ſo neither are they capable of receiving an Affront. For there is this difference betwixt an <hi>Affront</hi> and an <hi>Injury,</hi> as your Grace very well knows; an <hi>Affront</hi> muſt come from a Perſon that is both able to give it, and maintain it when he has given it. An Injury may de done by any ſort of People whatſoever. For Example, a Man walking in the Street about his Buſineſs is ſet upon by ten Arm'd Men, who Cudgel him; he draws his Sword to revenge the Injury, but the Aſſailants over power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him he cannot have the Satisfaction he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd. This Man is Injur'd but not Affronted. But to confirm it by another Inſtance, ſuppoſe a Man comes behind another's back, hits him a box o'the
<pb n="929" facs="tcp:54446:502"/>
Ear, and then runs away; the other follows him, but can't overtake him. He that has receiv'd the Blow has receiv'd an Injury, 'tis true, but not an Affront; becauſe to make it an Affront, it ſhould have been juſtifi'd. But if he that gave it, though he did it baſely, ſtands his Ground, and faces his Adverſary, then he that receiv'd it is both Injur'd. and Aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>onted: Injur'd, becauſe he was ſtruck in a Cowardly manner; Aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>onted, becauſe he that ſtruck him ſtood his Ground to maintan what he had done. Therefore according to the ſettled Laws of Duelling, I may be Injur'd, but am not Affronted; for Children and Women are in no Danger, they need not fly, nor are they oblig'd to ſtand; and 'tis the ſame thing with the Clergy, for they carry no Arms, either Offenſive or Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive. Therefore though they are naturally bound by the Law of Self-preſervation to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet are they not oblig'd to offend others. Upon ſecond Thoughts then, though I ſaid juſt now, I was Injur'd, I think now, I am not. For he that can receive no Affront can give none. Therefore I ought not to have any reſentment for what that good Man ſaid, neither indeed have I any. I only wiſh he would have ſtaid a little longer, that I might have convinc'd him of his Errour, in believing there were never any Knight-Errants in the World.

                           </hi> or any one of his innumerable Race, but heard him ſay any thing like this, I can aſſure his Reverence, it would have gone hard with him. I'll be ſworn it would, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> they would have undone him, as you would undo an Oiſter; and have cleft him from Head to Foot, as one would ſlice a Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granate, or a ripe Muskmelon; take my Word for't. They were a parcel of tough Blades, and would not have ſwallow'd ſuch a Pill. By the

Mackins I verily believe, had <hi>Rinaldo</hi> of <hi>Montalban</hi> but heard the poor Toad talk at this Rate, he would have laid him on ſuch a poult over the Chaps with his Shoulder o' Mutton Fiſt, as would have ſecur'd him from prating theſe three Years. Ay, ay, if he had fallen into their Clutches, ſee how he would have got out again!</p>
                        <p>The Dutcheſs was ready to die with laughing at <hi>Sancho,</hi> whom ſhe thought a more pleaſent Fool, and a greater Mad-man than his Maſter; and ſhe was not the only Perſon at that time of this Opinion. In ſhort, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> being pacify'd, they made an end of Dinner; and then while ſome of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants were taking away, there came in four Damſels, one carrying a Silver-Baſon, another an Ewer of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> ſame Metal; a third two very fine Towels over her Arm, and the fourth, with her Sleeves tuck'd above her Elbows, held in her Lilly-white Hand (for doubtleſs white it was) a large Waſh-ball of <hi>Naples</hi>-Soap. Preſently ſhe that held the Baſon, went very civilly, and clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p'd it under Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Chin, while he, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring at this extraordinary Ceremony, yet fancying it was the Cuſtom of the Country to waſh the Face inſtead of the Hands, thruſt out his long Chin, without ſpeaking a Word; and then the Ewer began to Rain upon his Face, and the Damſel that brought the Waſh-ball fell to Work, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lather'd his Beard ſo effectually, that the Suds, like huge Flakes of Snow, flew all over the paſſive Knight's Face; inſomuch, that he was forc'd to ſhut his Eyes.</p>
                        <p>The Duke and the Dutcheſs, who knew nothing of the matter, ſtood expecting where this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Scouring would end. The Femal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There he ſat expos'd to all the Company, with half a yard of Neck ſtretch'd out, his briſtly Beard and Chaps all in a white Foam, which did not at all mend his Walnut-Complexion, inſomuch that 'tis not a little ſtrange- how thoſe that had ſo comical a Spectacle before 'em could forbear laughing out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. The Malicious Damſels, who had a Hand in the Plot, did not dare to look up, nor let their Eyes meet thoſe of their Maſter or Miſtreſs, who ſtood ſtrangely divided between Anger and Mirth, not knowing what to do in the Caſe, whether they ſhould puniſh the Girls for their Boldneſs, or reward 'em for the Diverſion they took in ſeeing the Knight in that Poſture.</p>
                        <p>At laſt the Maid came back with the Water, and the other having rins'd off the Soap, ſhe that held the Linnen, gently wip'd and dry'd the Knight's Beard and Face; after which all four dropping a low Curtſy were going out of the Room. But the Duke, that Don <hi>Quixote</hi> might not ſmell the Jeſt, call'd to the Damſel that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd the Baſon, and order'd her to come and Waſh him too, but be ſure ſhe had Water enough. The Wench being ſharp and cunning, came and put the Baſon under the Duke's Chin, as ſhe had done to Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> but with a quicker Diſpatch, and then having dry'd him clean, they all made their Honours, and went off. It was well they underſtood their Maſter's Meaning, in ſerving him as they did the Knight; for, as it was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards known, had they not done it, the Duke was reſolv'd to have made 'em pay dear for their Frolick.</p>

                           <pb n="932" facs="tcp:54446:504"/>
                           <hi>Sancho</hi> took great Notice of all the Ceremonies at this Waſhing. S'Life! quoth he, I'd fain know whether 'tis not the Cuſtom of this Country to ſcrub the Squire's Beard, as well as the Knight's. For o' my Conſcience mine wants it not a little. Nay, if they would run it over with a Razor too, ſo much the better. What art thou talking to thy ſelf, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid the Dutcheſs? Why, an't like your Gace's Worſhip, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I'm only ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that I've been told how in other great Houſes, when the Cloath is taken away, they uſe to give Folks Water to waſh their Hands, and not Suds to ſcour their Beards. I ſee now 'tis good to Live and Learn. There's a Saying indeed, he that Lives long, ſuffers much. But I have a huge Fancy, that to ſuffer one of theſe ſame Scourings, is rather a Pleaſure than a Pain. Well, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid the Dutcheſs, trouble thy ſelf no farther, I'll ſee that one of my Maids ſhall Waſh thee, and if there be occaſion, lay thee a Bucking too. My Beard is all I want to have ſcrubb'd at preſent, quoth <hi>Sancho:</hi> As for the reſt, we'll think on't another time. Here, Steward, ſaid the Dutcheſs, ſee that <hi>Sancho</hi> has what he has a Mind to, and be ſure do juſt as he would have you. The Steward told her Grace, that Signior <hi>Sancho</hi> ſhou'd want for nothing; and ſo he took <hi>Sancho</hi> along with him to Dinner.</p>
                        <p>Mean while Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ſtay'd with the Duke and Dutcheſs, talking of ſeveral Matters, but all relating to Arms and Knight-Errantry. The Dutcheſs then took an Opportunity to deſire the Knight to give a particular Deſcription of the Lady <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo</hi>'s Beauty and Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, not doubting but his good Memory wou'd enable him to do it well; adding withal, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Voice of Fame, ſhe muſt needs be

the fineſt Creature in the whole World, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently in all <hi>La Mancha.</hi>

                        <p>With that, Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> fetching a deep Sigh, Madam, ſaid he, cou'd I rip out my Heart, and expoſe it to you Grace's View in a Diſh on this Table, I might ſave my Tongue the Labour of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting that which it cannot expreſs, and you can ſcarce believe; for there your Grace wou'd ſee her Beauty depainted to the Life. But why ſhould I undertake to delineate, and copy one by one each ſeveral Perfection of the Peerleſs <hi>Dulcinea!</hi> That Burden muſt be ſuſtain'd by ſtronger Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders than mine: That Task were worthy of the Pencils of <hi>Parrhaſius, Timantes,</hi> and <hi>Apelles,</hi> or the Tools of <hi>Lyſippus.</hi> The Hands of the beſt Painters and Statuaries ſhou'd indeed be employ'd to give in Speaking Paint, in Marble and <hi>Corinthian</hi> Braſs, an exact Copy of her Beauties; while <hi>Ciceronian</hi> and <hi>Demoſthenian</hi> Eloquence labour'd to reach the Praiſe of her other Endowments. Pray, Sir, ask'd the Dutcheſs, what do you mean by that Word <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenian?

'Tis true, ſaid the Duke; and you but ſhew'd your Ignorance, my Dear, in asking ſuch a Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

her Perſon: For your Grace muſt know, that as I lately went to Kiſs her Hands, and obtain her Leave for my intended Abſence in queſt of new Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, I found her quite another Creature than I expected. I found her Inchanted, Transform'd, from a Princeſs to a Country-Wench, from Beauty to Uglineſs, from Courtlineſs to Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticity, from a reſerv'd Lady to a Jumping <hi>Joan,</hi> from Sweetneſs it ſelf to the Stench of a Pole-cat, from Light to Darkneſs, from an Angel to a Devil; and, in ſhort, from <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo,</hi> to a Peaſanteſs of <hi>Sayago.</hi> Bleſs us! cry'd the Duke, with a loud Voice, What Villain has done the World ſuch an Injury? Who has robb'd it not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Beauty that was its Ornament, but of thoſe charming Graces that were its Delight, and that Vertue which was its Living Honour? Who ſhould it be, reply'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> but one of thoſe Damn'd Inchanters, one of thoſe numerous En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Fiends, that without Ceſſation Perſecute me. That wicked Brood of Hell, Spawn'd into the World to Eclipſe the Glory of Good and Valiant Men, and Blemiſh their Exploits, while they Labour to Exalt and Magnifie the Actions of the Wicked. Theſe Curſed Magicians have Perſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, and Perſecute me now, and will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue till they have ſunk me and my lofty Deeds of Chivalry into the Profound Abyſs of Oblivion. Yes, yes, they chuſe to Wound me in that Part which they well know is moſt ſenſible: Well knowing, that to deprive a Knight-Errant of his Lady, is to rob him of thoſe Eyes with which he ſees, of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>
                           <pb n="935" facs="tcp:54446:505"/>I grant all this, ſaid the Dutcheſs; yet if we may believe the Hiſtory of your Life, which was lately Publiſh'd with Univerſal Applauſe, it ſeems to imply, to the beſt of my Remembrance, that you never ſaw the Lady <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> and that there is no ſuch Lady in the World; but rather that ſhe it a meer Notional Creature, engender'd and brought forth by the Strength and Heat of your Fancy, and there Endow'd with all the Charms and good Qualifications, which you are pleas'd to aſcribe to her.</p>
                        <p>Much may be ſaid upon this Point, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> Heaven knows whether there be a <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinea</hi> in the World or not, and whether ſhe be a Notional Creature or not. Theſe are Myſteries not to be ſo narrowly inquir'd into. Neither have I Engender'd, or Begot that Lady. I do indeed make her the Object of my Contemplations, and, as I ought, look on her as a Lady endow'd with all thoſe Qualifications that may raiſe the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a Perſon to Univerſal Fame. She is to me bautiful without Blemiſh, reſerv'd without Pride, Amorous with Modeſty, agreeable for her Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Temper, and Courteous, as an Effect of her generous Education; and, in ſhort, of an Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Parentage. For Beauty Diſplays its Luſtre to a higher Degree of Perfection when match'd with Noble Blood, than it can in thoſe that are meanly Deſcended.</p>
                        <p>The Obſervation is juſt, ſaid the Duke; but give me leave, Sir, to propoſe to you a Doubt, which the Reading of that Hiſtory has ſtarted in my Mind: 'Tis, that, allowing there be a <hi>Dulci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="936" facs="tcp:54446:506"/>
of whom we read in thoſe Hiſtories, with which you have been ſo Converſant. To this, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> I Anſwer, that <hi>Dulcinea</hi> is the Daughter of her own Actions, and that Virtue ennobles the Blood. A virtuous Man of mean Condition, is more to be Eſteem'd than a Vicious Perſon of Quality. Beſides, <hi>Dulcinea</hi> is poſſeſs'd of thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Endowments that may entitle her to Crowns and Scepters, ſince Beauty alone has rais'd many of her Sex to the Throne. Where Merit has no Limits, Hope may well have no Bounds; and to be Fair and Vertuous is ſo Extenſive an Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that it gives, tho' not a <hi>Formal,</hi> at leaſt a <hi>Virtual</hi> Claim to larger Fortunes. I muſt own, Sir, ſaid the Dutcheſs, that in all your Diſcourſe, you, as we ſay, proceed with the Plummet of Reaſon, and Fathom all the Depths of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie. Therefore, I ſubmit, and from this time I am reſolv'd to believe and maintain, that there is a <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo</hi> Extant, and Living at this Day; that ſhe is Beautiful and of good Extraction; and to ſumm up all in a Word, altogether de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But yet I muſt confeſs, there is ſtill one Scruple that makes me uneaſie, and cauſes me to have an ill Opinion of <hi>Sancho.</hi> 'Tis that the Hiſtory tells us, that when <hi>Sancho Pança</hi> carried your Letter to the Lady <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> he found her Winnowing a Sack of Corn, by the ſame Token that it was the worſt ſort of Wheat, which makes me much doubt her Quality.</p>
                        <p>Your Grace muſt know, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> that almoſt every thing that relates to me, is manag'd quite contrary to what the Affairs of other Knight-Errants us'd to be. Whether it be the unfatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Will of Deſtiny, or the Implacable Malice
<pb n="937" facs="tcp:54446:506"/>
of ſome envious Inchanter orders it ſo, or no, I can't well tell. For 'tis beyond all doubt, that moſt of us Knight-Errants ſtill have had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing peculiar in our Fates. One has had the Privilege to be above the Power of Inchantments, another to be Invulnerable, as the Famous <hi>Orlando</hi> one of the twelve Peers of <hi>France,</hi> whoſe Fleſh, they tell us, was impenetrable every where but in the Sole of his left Foot, and even there too he cou'd be Wounded with no other Weapon than the Point of a great Pin; ſo that when <hi>Bernardo del Carpio</hi> depriv'd him of Life at <hi>Ronceſvalles,</hi> finding he cou'd not Wound him with his Sword, he lifted him from the Ground, and ſqueez'd him to Death in his Arms; remembring how <hi>Hercules</hi> kill'd <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taeus,</hi> that cruel Giant, who was ſaid to be the Son of the Earth. Hence I infer, that probably I may be ſecur'd in the ſame manner, under the Protection of ſome particular Advantage, tho' 'tis not that of being Invulnerable; for I have often found by Experience, that my Fleſh is tender, and not impenetrable. Nor does any private Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive free me from the Power of Inchantment; for I have found my ſelf clapp'd into a Cage, where all the World cou'd not have Lock'd me up, but the force of Necromantick Incantations. But ſince I got free again, I believe that even the force of Magick will never be able to Confine me thus another time. So that theſe Magicians find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they cannot work their wicked Ends directly on me, revenge themſelves on what I moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, and endeavour to take away my Life by Perſecuting that of <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> in whom, and for whom I Live. And therefore I believe, when my Squire deliver'd my Embaſſy to her, they Transform'd her into a Count<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wheat. But I do aver, that it was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rye, nor Wheat, but Oriental Pearl; and to prove this, I muſt acquaint your Graces, that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing t'other Day by <hi>Toboſo,</hi> I could not ſo much as find <hi>Dulcinea</hi>'s Palace; whereas my Squire went the next Day, and ſaw her in all her Native Charms, the moſt Beautiful Creature in the World; yet when I met her preſently after, ſhe appear'd to me in the Shape of an Ugly, Courſe, Country-Mawkin, Booriſh, and Ill-bred, though ſhe really is Diſcretion it ſelf. And therefore, becauſe I my ſelf cannot be Inchanted, the unfortunate Lady muſt be thus Inchanted, Miſ-us'd, Disfigur'd, chopp'd and chang'd. Thus my Enemies wreak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Malice on her, have Reveng'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on me; which makes me abandon my ſelf to Sorrow, till ſhe be reſtor'd to her former Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
                        <p>I have been the more large in this Particular, that no body might inſiſt on what <hi>Sancho</hi> ſaid of her ſifting of Corn: For if ſhe appear'd Chang'd to me, what Wonder is it if ſhe ſeem'd ſo to him. In ſhort, <hi>Dulcinea</hi> is both Illuſtrious and well-born, being deſcended of the moſt ancient and beſt Families in <hi>Toboſo,</hi> of whoſe Blood I am poſitive ſhe has no ſmall ſhare in her Veins; and now that Town will be no leſs famous in after-Ages for being the Place of her Nativity, than <hi>Troy</hi> for <hi>Helen,</hi> or <hi>Spain</hi> for<note n="*" place="bottom">The Nick-name of Count <hi>Julian</hi>'s Daughter, who having been Raviſh'd by King <hi>Rodrigo,</hi> occaſion'd the bringing in of the <hi>Moors</hi> into <hi>Spain.</hi>

                        <p>As for <hi>Sancho Pança</hi>'s part, I aſſure your Grace he is one of the moſt pleaſant Squires that ever
<pb n="939" facs="tcp:54446:507"/>
waited on a Knight-Errant. Sometimes he comes out with ſuch ſharp Simplicities, that one is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly puzzl'd to judge, whether he be more Knave or Fool. The Varlet, indeed, is full of Roguery enough to be thought a Knave; but then he has yet more Ignorance, and may better be thought a Fool. He doubts of every thing, yet believes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing; and when one would think he had entangl'd himſelf in a piece of downright Folly beyond recovery, he brings himſelf off of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſo cleverly, that he is applauded to the Skies. In ſhort, I would not change him for the beſt Squire that wears a Head, tho' I might have a City to boot, and therefore I don't know whether I had beſt let him go to the Government which your Grace has been pleas'd to promiſe him. Though, I muſt confeſs, his Talent ſeems to lie pretty much that way: For, give never ſo little a whet to his Underſtanding, he will manage his Government as well as the King does his Cuſtoms. Then Experience convinces us, that neither Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nor any other Abilities are very material to a Governour. Have we not a hundred of 'em that can ſcarce Read a Letter, and yet they Govern as ſharp as ſo many Hawks. Their main Buſineſs is only to mean well, and to be reſolv'd to do their beſt; for they can't want able Counſellors to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct 'em. Thus thoſe Governors who are Men of the Sword, and no Scholars, have their Aſſeſſors on the Bench to direct them. My Counſel to <hi>Sancho</hi> ſhall be, that he neither take Bribes, nor loſe his Privileges, with ſome other little Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which I have in my Head for him, and which at a proper time I will communicate, both to his private Advantage, and the publick Good of the Iſland he is to Govern.</p>

                           <pb n="940" facs="tcp:54446:508"/>So far had the Duke, the Dutcheſs, and Don <hi>Quixote</hi> been Diſcourſing together, when they heard a great Noiſe in the Houſe; and by and by <hi>Sancho</hi> came running in unexpectedly into the Room where they ſate, in a terrible Fright, with a Diſh-clout before him inſtead of a Bib. The Scullions, and other greaſie Rabble of the Kitchen were about him, one of 'em purſuing him with a little Kneading-Trough full of Diſh-water, which he endeavour'd by any means to put under his Chin, while another ſtood ready to have waſh'd the poor Squire with it. How now, Fellow, ſaid the Dutcheſs! What's the matter here? What wou'd you do with this good Man? Don't you conſider he's a Governor Elect? Madam, quoth the Barber-Scullion, the Gentleman won't let us waſh him according to Cuſtom, as my Lord Duke and his Maſter were. Yes marry but I will, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> in a mighty Huff, but then it ſhall be with clearer Sudds, cleaner Towels, and not quite ſo ſtovenly Paws; for there's no ſuch difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween my Maſter and me neither, that he muſt be waſh'd with <hi>Angel-Water,</hi> and I with the Devil's Lye: So far the Cuſtoms of great Men's Houſes are good as they give no Offence. But this ſame Beaſtly waſhing in a Puddle, is worſe Pennance than a Frier's Flogging. My Beard is clean e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and wants no ſuch refreſhing. Stand clear, you had beſt; for the firſt that comes to waſh me or touch a Hair of my Head (my Beard I would ſay) Sir, Reverence of the Company, I'll take him ſuch a Dowſe o' th' Ear, he ſhall feel it a Twelvemonth after: For theſe kind of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Soapings, d'ye ſee, look more like Flouts and Jeers, than like a civil Welcome to Strangers! The Dutcheſs was like to have burſt her Sides with Laughing, to ſee <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Fury, and hear how

he argu'd for himſelf. But Don <hi>Quixote</hi> did not very well like to ſee him with ſuch a naſty Diſh-Clout about his Neck, and made the ſport of the Kitchen-Penſioners. Therefore after he had made a deep Bow to the Duke, as it were deſiring Leave to ſpeak, looking on the Scullions: Hark ye, Gentlemen, cry'd he, very gravely, Pray let the Young Man alone, and get you gone as you came, if you think fit. My Squire is as cleanly is another Man; your Trough won't do, you might as well have brought him a Dram-Cup. Away; be advis'd by me, and leave him: For neither he nor I can abide ſuch ſlovenly Jeſtings. No, no, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> taking the Words out of his Maſter's Mouth, let 'em ſtay, and go on with their Show. I'll pay my Barbers, I'll warrant ye. They had as good take a Lion by the Beard as meddle with mine. Let 'em bring a Comb hither, or what they will, and Curry-comb it, and if they find any thing there that ſhould not be there, I'll give 'em leave to cut and mince me as ſmall as a Horſe. <hi>Sancho</hi> is in the right, ſaid the Dutcheſs, ſtill Laughing, and will be in the right, in all he ſays; he is as clean and neat as can be, and needs none of your ſcouring; and if he does not like our way of Waſhing, let him do as he pleaſes. Beſides, you who pretend to make others clean, have ſhewn your ſelves now very Careleſs and Idle. I don't know whether I mayn't ſay Impudent too, to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to bring your Kneading-Trough and your Diſh-clouts to ſuch a Perſon, and ſuch a Beard, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Golden Baſon and Ewer, and fine Diaper-Towels.

So they took the Cloath from <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Neck, and ſneak'd off quite out of Countenance. <hi>Sancho</hi> ſeeing himſelf deliver'd from his Apprehenſions of this Danger, ran and threw himſelf on his Knees before the Dutcheſs. Heaven bleſs your Worſhip's Grace, quoth he, Madam Dutcheſs. Great Perſons are able to do great Kindneſſes. For my part, I don't know how to make your Worſhip amends for this you've done me now. I can only wiſh I might ſee my my ſelf an Arm'd Knight-Errant for your ſake, that I might ſpend all the Days of my Life in the Service of ſo high a Lady. I am a poor Country-Man, my Name is <hi>Sancho Pança,</hi> Children I have, and ſerve as a Squire. If in any of theſe Matters, I can do you any good, you need but ſpeak; I'll be nimbler in doing than your Worſhip ſhall be in ordering.

Now, becauſe I'm pretty confident of knowing his blind Side, whatever Crotchets come into my Crown, though without either Head or Tall, yet can I make 'em paſs upon him for Goſpel. Such was the Anſwer to his Letter, and another Sham that I put upon him but t'other Day, and is not in Print yet, touching my Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi>'s Inchantment; for you muſt know, between you and I, ſhe's no more inchanted than the Man in the Moon. With that, at the Dutcheſs's Requeſt, he related the whole Paſſage of the late pretended Inchantment very faithfully, to the great Diverſion of the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. But Sir, ſaid the Dutcheſs, I have another Scruple in this Affair no leſs unaccountable than the former; for I think I hear ſomething whiſper me in the Ear, and ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If Don <hi>Quixote de la Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I can only infer from this, that the Man is
<pb n="946" facs="tcp:54446:511"/>
more a Fool than the Maſter; and if ſo, will not Madam Dutcheſs be thought as mad as either of 'em, to beſtow the Government of an Iſland, or the Command of others, on one who can't govern himſelf? By'r Lady, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> your Scruple comes in Pudding-time. But it need not whiſper in your Ear, it may e'en ſpeak plain, and as loud as it will. I am a Fool that's certain, for if I'd been wiſe, I had left my Maſter many a fair Day ſince; but it was my Luck and my vile Errantry, and that's all can be ſaid on't. I muſt follow him through Thick and Thin. We are both Towns-born Children; I have eaten his Bread, I love him well, and there's no Love loſt between us. He pays me well, he has giv'n me three Colts, and I am ſo very true and truſty to him, that nothing but Death can part us. And if your High and Mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs does not think fit to let me have this ſame Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, why even do ſo; with leſs was I born, and with leſs ſhall I die; it may be for the Good of my Conſcience to go without it. I am a Fool 'tis true, but yet I underſtand the Meaning of the Saying, The Piſmire had Wings to do her Hurt; and <hi>Sancho</hi> the Squire, may ſooner get to Heaven than <hi>Sancho</hi> the Governour. There's as good Bread bak'd here as in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Joan</hi>'s as good as my Lady in the Dark. Unhapppy's he that wants his Breakfaſt at two in the Afternoon. 'Tis always good Faſting after a good Breakfaſt. There's no Man has a Stomach a Yard bigger than another, but let it be never ſo big, there will be Hay and Straw enough to fill it. A Belly full's a Belly full. The Sparrow ſpeeds as well as the Sparrow-Hawk. Good Serge is fine, but coarſe Cloth is warm; and four Yards of the one are as long as four Yards of the other. When the Hour is come we muſt all be pack'd off; the Prince and the Prick-Louſe go
<pb n="947" facs="tcp:54446:511"/>
the ſame Way at laſt; the Road is no fairer for the one than the other, and the Pope and the Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton may peer in the Pit; and ſo good Den and good Night, Friends muſt part, as the King ſaid to his Hounds. And let me tell you again, if you don't think fit to give me an Iſland 'cauſe I'm a Fool, I'll be ſo wiſe as not to care whether you do or no. 'Tis an old Saying, The Devil lurks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Croſs. All is not Gold that gliſters.

That they are indeed, ſaid Donna <hi>Rodriguez,</hi> the old Waiting-Woman, who liſten'd among the reſt; for I remember one of the Ballads tells us how Don <hi>Rodrigo</hi> was ſhut up alive in a Tomb full of Toads, Snakes, and Lizards; and how after two Days he was heard to cry out of the Tomb in a low and doleful Voice, now they eat me, now they gnaw me in the Part where I ſinn'd moſt, And according to this the Gentleman is in the Right, in ſaying he had rather be a poor Labourer, than a King, to be gnaw'd to Death by Vermin.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sancho</hi>'s proverbial Aphoriſms, and the ſimple Waiting-woman's Comment upon the Text, were no ſmall Diverſion to the Dutcheſs. You know, ſaid ſhe, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Take Courage then <hi>Sancho,</hi> for when you leaſt dream on't, in ſpight of all the Envy and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the World, you will ſuddenly ſee your ſelf in full Poſſeſſion of your Government, and ſeated

in your Chair of State in your rich Robes, with all your Marks and Ornaments of Power about you. But be ſure to adminiſter true Juſtice to your Vaſſals, who by their Loyalty and Diſcretion will merit no leſs at your Hands.</p>
                        <p>As for the governing Part, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> let me alone. I was ever charitable and good to the Poor, and ſcorn to take the Bread out of another Man's Mouth. On the other Side, by'r Lady, they ſhall play me no foul Play. I'm an old Cur at a Cruſt, and can ſleep Dog-ſleep when I liſt. I can look ſharp as well as another, and let me alone to keep the Cobwebs out of my Eyes. I know where the Shooe wrings me; I'll know who and who's toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Honeſty's the beſt Policy. I'll ſtick to that. The Good ſhall have my Hand and Heart, but the Bad neither Foot nor Fellowſhip. And in my Mind, the main Point in this Point of Governing, is to make a good Beginning. I'll lay my Life, that as ſimple as <hi>Sancho</hi> ſits here, in a Fortnight's Time he'll manage ye this ſame Iſland as tightly as a Sheaf of Barley. You ſay well <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid the Dutcheſs, for Time ripens all things. No Man's born wiſe; Biſhops are made of Men, and not of Stones. But to return once more to the Lady <hi>Dulcinea;</hi> I am more than half perſwaded that <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Deſign of putting the Trick upon his Maſter, was turn'd into a greater Cheat upon himſelf: For I am well aſſur'd that the Creature whom you fancy'd to be a Country-Wench, and took ſo much Pains to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade your Maſter that ſhe was <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo,</hi> was really the ſame <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo,</hi> and really inchanted, as Don <hi>Quixote</hi> thought; and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians that perſecute your Maſter firſt invented that Story, and put it into your Head. For you muſt know, that we have our Inchanters here that have a Kindneſs for us, and give us an Account of
<pb n="949" facs="tcp:54446:512"/>
what happens in the World faithfully and imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, without any Tricks or Equivocations; and take my Word for't, the jumping Country-Wench was and is ſtill <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo,</hi> who is as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inchanted as the Mother that bore her; and when we leaſt expect it, we ſhall ſee her again in her true Shape and in all her native Luſtre, and then <hi>Sancho</hi> will find 'twas he himſelf was bubbl'd. Troth Madam, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> all this might well be: And now I am apt to believe what my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter tells me of <hi>Monteſino</hi>'s Cave; where, as he ſays, he ſaw my Lady <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo</hi> in the ſelf-ſame Garb, and as handſome as I told him I had ſeen her when it came into my Noddle to tell him ſhe was inchanted. Ay, my Lady, it muſt be quite contrary to what I ween'd, as your Worſhip's Grace well obſerves; for, Lord bleſs us! who the Devil can imagine that ſuch a Numskull as I ſhould have it in him to deviſe ſo cunning a Trick of a Sudden? Beſides, who can think that my Maſter's ſuch a Gooſe, as to believe ſo unlikely a Matter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſingle Vouching of ſuch a dunder-headed Fellow as I? But for all that, my good Lady, I hope you know better things than to think me a Knave; alack-a-day, it can't be expected that ſuch an Ignoramus as I am ſhou'd be able to divine into the Tricks and Wiles of wicked Magicians. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented that Flam only becauſe my Maſter wou'd never leave teizing me; but I had no Mind to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe him, not I; and if it fell out otherwiſe than I meant, who can help it? Heaven knows my Heart. That's honeſtly ſaid, anſwer'd the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs; but pray tell me, <hi>Sancho,</hi> What was it you were ſpeaking of <hi>Mont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They can't be few for ought I ſee, and they are plag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now if that ſame Dowdy was <hi>Dulcinea</hi> in good Earneſt, how can I help it? I ought not to be call'd to an Account for't. No, let the Saddle be ſet upon the right Horſe, or we ſhall ne'er ha' done. <hi>Sancho</hi> told me this, crys one; <hi>Sancho</hi> told me that, crys t'ther; <hi>Sancho</hi> o' this Side, <hi>Sancho</hi> o' that Side; <hi>Sancho</hi> did this, and <hi>Sancho</hi> did that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if <hi>Sancho</hi> were I don't know who, and not the ſame <hi>Sancho</hi> that goes already far and near thro' the World in Books, as <hi>Sampſon Carraſco</hi> tells me, and he's no leſs than a Batchelor of Arts at <hi>Salamanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He that has been a good Servant, will make a good Maſter; a truſty Squire will make a rare Governour I'll warrant you. <hi>Sancho</hi> ſpeaks like an Oracle, ſaid the Dutcheſs; every thing he ſays is a Sentence like thoſe of <hi>Cato,</hi> or at leaſt the very Marrow of <hi>Michael V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Faith and Troth Madam Dutcheſs, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I never drank out of Malice in my born Days; for Thirſt perhaps I may; for I ha'n't a Bit of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy in me. I drink when I have Occaſion, and ſometimes when I have no Occaſion: I'm no proud Man d'ye ſee, and when the Liquor's offer'd me I whip it off, that they mayn't take me for a Churl or a Sneaksby, or think I don't underſtand my ſelf nor good Manners; for when a Friend or a good Fellow drinks and puts the Glaſs to one, who can be ſo hard-hearted as to refuſe to pledge him, when it coſts nothing but to open one's Mouth? Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I commonly look before I leap<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and take no more than needs muſt. And truly there's no Fear we poor Squires to Knights-Errant ſhould be great Treſpaſſers that Way. Alack-a-day! meer Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be our daily Beveridge, Ditch-water, for want of better, in Woods and Deſarts, on Rocks and Mountains, without lighting on that Bleſſing of one merciful Drop of Wine, tho' you'd give one of your Eyes for a ſingle Gulp.</p>
                        <p>I believe it <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid the Dutcheſs; but now it grows late, and therefore go and take ſome Reſt; after that we'll have a longer Converſation, as you're pleas'd to word it. <hi>Sancho</hi> kiſs'd the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs's Hand once more, and begg'd her Worſhip's Grace that ſpecial Care might be taken of his <hi>Dap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

I'd ſooner be ſtuck in the Guts with a Butcher's Knife than you ſhou'd be ſerv'd ſo; I am better bred than that comes to; for tho' my Lord and Maſter has taught me, that in Point of Haviour one ought rather to over-do than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-do, yet when the Caſe lies about an Aſs and the Ball of one's Eye, 'tis beſt to think twice, and go warily about the Matter. Well, ſaid the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs, your Aſs may go with you to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and there you may feed him, and pamper him, and make as much of him as you pleaſe.

Objection, was to me the moſt Prevalent Inducement to this Addreſs.

                        <p>THE Duke and the Dutcheſs were extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diverted with the Humours of their Gueſts. Reſolving therefore to improve their Sport, by carrying on ſome pleaſant Deſign,
<pb n="956" facs="tcp:54446:521"/>
that might bear the Appearance of an Adventure, they took the Hint from Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Account of <hi>Monteſino</hi>'s Cave, as a Subject from which they might raiſe an extraordinary Entertainment: The rather, ſince, to the Dutcheſs's Amazement, <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi>'s Simplicity was ſo great, as to believe that <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo</hi> was really inchanted, though he himſelf had been the firſt Contriver of the Story, and her only Inchanter.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, having given Directions to their Servants that nothing might be wanting, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd a Day for Hunting the Wild Boar, in five or ſix Days they were ready to ſet out, with a Train of Huntſmen and other Attendants not unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greateſt Prince. They preſented Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote</hi> with a Hunting-Suit, but he refus'd it, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſuperfluous, ſince he was in a ſhort Time to return to the hard Exerciſe of Arms, and could carry no Sumpters or Wardrobes along with him. But <hi>Sancho</hi> readily accepted one of fine green Cloth, which was prepar'd for him, becauſe he imagin'd it a good Moveable, which he would convert into Money upon the firſt Occaſion.</p>
                        <p>The Day prefix'd being come, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> Arm'd, and <hi>

The Dutcheſs alſo in a Dreſs both odd and gay, made one of the Company. The Knight, who was Courteſy it ſelf, very gallantly would needs hold the Reins of her Palfrey, though the Duke ſeem'd very unwilling to let him. In ſhort, they came to the Scene of their Sport, which was in a Wood between two very high Mountains, where alighting, and taking their ſeveral Stands, the Dutcheſs with a pointed Javelin in her Hand, attended by the Duke and Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> took
<pb n="957" facs="tcp:54446:521"/>
a Paſs where the Boar always us'd to make his way. The Hunters poſted themſelves in ſeveral Lanes and Paths as they moſt conveniently could. But as for <hi>Sancho,</hi> he choſe to ſtay behind 'em all with his <hi>Dapple,</hi> whom he would by no means leave a Moment, for fear the poor Creature ſhould meet with ſome ſad Accident.</p>
                        <p>And now the Chace began with a full Cry, the Dogs open'd, the Horns ſounded, and the Huntſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men hollow'd in ſo loud a Conſort, that there was no hearing one another. Soon after, a hideous Boar, of a monſtrous Size, came on, gnaſhing his Teeth and Tusks, and foaming at the Mouth; and, being baited hard by the Dogs, and follow'd cloſe by the Huntſmen, made furiouſly towards the Paſs which Don <hi>Quixote</hi> had taken. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Knight graſping his Shield, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Sword, mov'd forward to receive the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Beaſt. The Duke join'd him with a Boar-Spear, and the Dutcheſs would have been foremoſt had not the Duke prevented her. <hi>Sancho</hi> alone ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the furious Animal, reſolv'd to ſhift for one, and leaving <hi>Dapple,</hi> away he ſcudded as faſt as his Legs would carry him towards an high Oak, to the top of which he endeavour'd to clamber. But as he was getting up, one of the Boughs unluckily broke, and down he was tumbling, when a Snag or Stump of another Bough caught hold of his new Coat, and ſtopp'd his Fall, ſlinging him in the Air by the Middle, ſo that he could neither get up nor down. His fine Green Coat was torn, and he fancy'd every Moment the wild Boar was running that way with foaming Chaps and dreadful Tusks to tear him to pieces. Which ſo diſturb'd him, that he roar'd and bellow'd for help, as if ſome wild Beaſt had been devouring him in good earneſt.</p>

                        <p>Mean while the Boar being laid acroſs a large Mule, and cover'd with Branches of Roſemary and Myrtle, was carry'd in Triumph by the Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Huntſmen to a large Field-Tent, pitch'd in the middle of the Wood, where an excellent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment was provided ſuitable to the Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the Founder.</p>

                        <p>After this, and ſuch like diverting Talk, they left the Tent, and walk'd into the Wood to ſee whether any Game had fall'n into their Nets. Now, while they were thus intent upon their Sport the Night drew on apace, and more cloudy and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt than was uſual at that Time of the Year, which was about Midſummer; but it happen'd very critically for the better carrying on the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="961" facs="tcp:54446:524"/>
Contrivance. A little while after the cloſe of the Evening, when it grew quite dark, in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Wood ſeem'd all on fire, and blaz'd in every Quarter. This was attended by an alarming Sound of Trumpets and other Warlike Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, anſwering one another from all Sides, as if ſeveral Parties of Horſe had been haſtily marching through the Wood: Then preſently was heard a confus'd Noiſe of <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Cries, ſuch as are us'd in joining Battel, which together with the rattling of the Drums, the loud Sound of the Trumpets, and other Inſtruments of War, made ſuch a hideous and dreadful Conſort in the Air, that the Duke was amaz'd, the Dutcheſs aſtoniſh'd, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was ſurpriz'd, and <hi>Sancho</hi> ſhook like a Leaf, and even thoſe that knew the Occaſion of all this were affrighted.</p>
                        <p>This Conſternation caus'd a general Silence, and by and by one riding Poſt, equipp'd like a Devil, paſs'd by the Company, winding a huge hollow Horn, that made a horrible hoarſe Noiſe. Hark you, Poſt, ſaid the Duke, whither ſo faſt? What are you? and what Parties of Soldiers are theſe that march a-croſs the Wood? I am the Devil, cry'd the Poſt in a horrible Tone, and go in queſt of Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha;</hi> and thoſe that are coming this way, are ſix Bands of Necromancers that conduct the Peerleſs <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo,</hi> inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a Triumphant Chariot. She is attended by that Gallant <hi>French</hi> Knight <hi>Monteſinos,</hi> who comes to give Information how ſhe may be free'd from Inchantment. Wer't thou as much a Devil, ſaid the Duke, as thy horrid Shape ſpeaks thee to be, thou would'ſt have known this Knight here before thee to be that Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha</hi> whom thou ſeek'ſt. Before Heaven, and on my Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, reply'd the Devil, I never thought on't; for
<pb n="962" facs="tcp:54446:525"/>
I have ſo many Things in my Head, that it almoſt diſtracts me, I had quite and clean forgot my Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand. Surely, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> this Devil muſt be a very honeſt Fellow, and a good Chriſtian, for he ſwears as devoutly by Heaven and his Conſcience, as I ſhould do; and now I am apt to believe there be ſome good People even in Hell. At the ſame time, the Devil directing himſelf to Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> without diſmounting, To thee, O Knight of the Lions, cry'd he, (and I wiſh thee faſt in their Claws) To thee am I ſent by the Valiant, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate <hi>Monteſinos,</hi> to bid thee attend his coming in this very Place, whither he brings one whom they call <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo,</hi> in order to give thee Inſtructions touching her Diſinchantment. Now I have deliver'd my Meſſage, I muſt fly, and the Devils that are like me be with thee, and Angels guard the reſt. This ſaid, he winded his mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Horn, and without ſtaying for an Anſwer, diſappear'd.</p>
                        <p>This encreas'd the general Conſternation, but moſt of all ſurpriz'd Don <hi>Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho;</hi> the latter to find that, in ſpight of Truth, they ſtill would have <hi>Dulcinea</hi> to be Inchanted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Knight to think that the Adventures of <hi>Monteſino</hi>'s Cave were turn'd to reality. While he ſtood pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering theſe things in his Thoughts; Well, Sir, ſaid the Duke to him, what do you intend to do? Will you ſtay? Stay! cry'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> ſhall I not? I will ſtay here, Intrepid and Courageous, though all the Infernal Powers enclos'd me round. So you may if you will, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> but if any more Devils or Horns come hither, they ſhall as ſoon find me in <hi>Flanders</hi> as here.</p>
                        <p>Now the Night grew darker and darker, and ſeveral ſhooting Lights were ſeen glancing up and down the Wood, like Meteors or glaring Exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="963" facs="tcp:54446:525"/>
from the Earth. Then was heard a horrid Noiſe, like the creaking of the ungreas'd Wheels of heavy Waggons, from which piercing ungrateful Sound, Bears and Wolves themſelves are ſaid to fly. This odious Jarring was preſently ſeconded by a greater, which ſeem'd to be the dreadful Din and Shocks of four ſeveral Engagements in each Quarter of the Wood, with all the Sounds and Hurry of ſo many join'd Battels. On one ſide were heard ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Peals of Cannon; on the other the Diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of numerous Vollies of ſmall Shot; here the Shouts of the Engaging Parties, that ſeem'd to be near at hand; there Cries of the <hi>Moors</hi> that ſeem'd at a greater Diſtance. In ſhort, the ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd Intermixture of Drums, Trumpets, Cornets, Horns, the Thund'ring of the Cannon, the Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Small-Shot, the Creaking of the Wheels, and the Cries of the Combatants, made the moſt diſmal Noiſe imaginable, and try'd Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Courage to the uttermoſt. But poor <hi>Sancho</hi> was annihilated, and fell into a Swoon upon the Dutcheſs's Coats, who taking Care of him, and ordering ſome Water to be ſprinkled in his Face, at laſt recover'd him, juſt as the foremoſt of the creaking Carriages came up, drawn by four heavy Oxen cover'd with Mourning, and carrying a large lighted Torch upon each Horn. On the Top of the Cart or Waggon was an exalted Seat, on which ſate a Venerable Old Man, with a Beard as white as Snow, and ſo long that it reach'd down to his Girdle. He was clad in a long Gown of black Buckram, as were alſo two Devils that drove the Waggons, both ſo very monſtrous and ugly, that <hi>Sancho</hi> having ſeen 'em once, was forc'd to ſhut his Eyes, and would not venture upon a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Look. The Cart, which was ſtuck full of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="964" facs="tcp:54446:526"/>
the Reverend old Man ſtood up, and cry'd with a loud Voice, I am the Sage <hi>Lirgander,</hi> and the Cart paſs'd on without a Word more being ſpoken. Then follow'd another Cart with another grave old Man, who, making the Cart ſtop at a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Diſtance, roſe up from his high Seat, and in as deep a Tone as the firſt, cry'd, I am the Sage <hi>Alquif,</hi> great Friend to <hi>Urganda</hi> the Unknown, and ſo went forward. He was ſucceeded by a third Cart, that mov'd in the ſame ſolemn Pace, and bore a Perſon not ſo ancient as the reſt, but a robuſt and ſturdy, ſowr-look'd, ill-favour'd Fellow, who roſe up from his Throne like the reſt, and with a more hollow and Devil-like Voice cry'd out, I am <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelaus</hi> the Inchanter, the mortal Enemy of <hi>Amadis de Gaul</hi> and all his Race; which ſaid, he paſs'd by, like the other Carts, which taking a ſhort Turn made a Halt, and the grating Noiſe of the Wheels ceaſing, an excellent Conſort of ſweet Muſick was heard, which migtily comforted poor <hi>Sancho;</hi> and paſſing with him for a good Omen, My Lady, (quoth he to the Dutcheſs, (from whom he would not budge an Inch) There can be no Miſchief ſure where there's Muſick. Very true, ſaid the Dutcheſs, eſpecially when there is Brightneſs and Light. Ay, but there's no Light without Fire, reply'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> and Brightneſs comes moſt from Flames; who knows but thoſe about us may burn us? But Muſick I take to be always a Sign of Feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Merriment. We ſhall know preſently what this will come to, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> and he ſaid right, for you will find it in the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

There was a high Throne erected at the further end, on which ſat a Nymph array'd in Cloath of Silver, with many Golden Spangles glittering all about her, which made her Dreſs, tho' not rich, appear very Glorious: Her Face was cover'd with tranſparent Gauze, through the flowing Folds of which might be deſcry'd a moſt Beautiful Face; and by the great Light which the Torches gave, it was eaſie to diſcern, that, as ſhe was not leſs than ſeventeen Years of Age, neither could ſhe be thought above twenty.

Paſſion of my Heart, Maſter <hi>Merlin,</hi> if you have no better way for diſinchanting the Lady <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> ſhe may e'en lye betwitch'd to her dying Day for me.</p>
                        <p>How now, opprobrious Raſcal, cry'd Don <hi>Quixote!</hi> ſtinking Garlick-eater! Sirrah, I will
<pb n="968" facs="tcp:54446:528"/>
take you and tye your Dogſhip to a Tree, as naked as your Mother bore you; and there I will not only give you three thouſand three hundred Laſhes, but ſix thouſand ſix hundred, ye Varlet, and ſo ſmartly, that you ſhall feel 'em ſtill though you rub your Back-ſide three thouſand Times, Scoundrel. Anſwer me a Word, you Rogue, and I'll tear out your Soul. Hold, hold, cry'd <hi>Merlin,</hi> hearing this, this muſt not be; the Stripes inflicted on honeſt <hi>Sancho</hi> muſt be volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, without Compulſion, and only laid on when he thinks moſt convenient. No ſet time is for the Task prefix'd, and if he has a mind to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated one half of this Atonement, 'tis allow'd; provided the remaining Stripes be ſtruck by a ſtrange Hand, and heavily laid on.</p>
                        <p>Hold you there, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> neither a ſtrange Hand nor my own, neither heavy nor light ſhall touch my Bum. What a Pox, did I bring Madam <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo</hi> into the World, that my hind Parts ſhould pay for the harm her Eyes have done? Let my Maſter Don <hi>Quixote</hi> whip himſelf, he's a part of her, he calls her every foot my Life, my Soul, my Suſtenance, my Comfort, and all that. So e'en let him jirk out her Inchantment at his own Bum's coſt; but as for any whipping of me, I deny and prenounce it flat and plain.</p>
                        <p>No ſooner had <hi>Sancho</hi> thus ſpoke his Mind, but the Nymph that ſat by <hi>Merlin</hi>'s Ghoſt in the glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Apparel, riſing, and lifting up her thin Veil, diſcover'd a very Beautiful Face; and with a Maſculine Grace, but no very agreeable Voice, addreſſing <hi>Sancho,</hi> O thou diſaſtrous Squire, ſaid ſhe, thou Lump with no more Soul than a broken Pitcher, Heart of Cork, and Bowels of Flint! Hadſt thou been Commanded, baſe Sheep-ſtealer, to have thrown thy ſelf headlong from the top of a
<pb n="969" facs="tcp:54446:528"/>
high Tower to the Ground; hadſt thou been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd, Enemy of Mankind, to have ſwallow'd a dozen of Toads, two dozen of Lizards, and three dozen of Snakes; or hadſt thou been requeſted to have Butcher'd thy Wife and Children, I ſhould not wonder that it had turn'd thy ſqueamiſh Stomach: But to make ſuch a heſitation at three thouſand three hundred Stripes, which every puny School-boy makes nothing of receiving every Month, 'tis amazing, nay, aſtoniſhing to the tender and commiſerating Bowels of all that hear thee, and will be a Blot in thy Scutcheon to all Futurity: Look up, thou wretched and Marble-hearted Animal, look up and fix thy huge louring Gog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle-Eyes upon the bright Luminaries of my Sight: Behold thoſe briny Torrents, which ſtreaming down, furrow the flowery Meadows of my Cheeks: Relent, baſe and inexorable Monſter, relent, let thy ſavage Breaſt confeſs at laſt a ſenſe of my Diſtreſs; and mov'd with the tenderneſs of my Youth, that conſumes and withers in this vile Transformation, crack this ſordid Shell of Ruſtici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that invelopes my blooming Charms. In vain has the Goodneſs of <hi>Merlin</hi> permitted me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſume a while my native Shape, ſince neither that, nor the Tears of Beauty in Affliction, which are ſaid to reduce obdurate Rocks to the ſoftneſs of Cotton, and Tygers to the tenderneſs of Lambs, are ſufficient to melt thy haggard Breaſt. Scourge, ſcourge that Brawny Hide of thine, Stubborn and unrelenting Brute, that courſe incloſure of thy courſer Soul, and rouſe up thus thy ſelf from that baſe Sloth that makes thee live only to eat and pamper thy lazy Fleſh, indulging ſtill thy voracious Appetite. Reſtore me the Delicacy of my Skin, the ſweetneſs of my Diſpoſition, and the Beauty of my Face. But if my Entreaties and Tears cannot
<pb n="970" facs="tcp:54446:529"/>
work thee into a reaſonable compliance, if I am not yet ſufficiently Wretched to move thy Pity, at leaſt let the Anguiſh of that miſerable Knight, thy tender Maſter, mollify thy Heart. Alaſs! I ſee his very Soul juſt at his Throat, and ſticking not ten Inches from his Lips, waiting only thy cruel or kind Anſwer, either to fly out of his Mouth or return into his Breaſt.</p>
                        <p>Don <hi>Quixote</hi> hearing this, clapp'd his Hand upon his Gullet, and turning to the Duke? By Heavens, my Lord, ſaid he, <hi>Dulcinea</hi> is in the right; for I find my Soul travers'd in my Windpipe like a Bullet in a Croſs-bow. What's your Anſwer now, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid the Dutcheſs? I ſay as I ſaid before, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> as for the flogging, I prenounce it flat and plain. Renounce you mean, ſaid the Duke. Good your Lordſhip, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> this is no time for me to mind Niceties, and ſpelling of Letters: I have other Fiſh to fry. This plaguy Whipping-bout makes me quite diſtracted, I don't know what I ſay or do—But I would fain know of my Lady <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo,</hi> where ſhe pick'd up this kind of Breeding, to beg thus like a ſturdy Begger? Here ſhe comes to deſire me to laſh my Back-ſide as raw as a piece of Beef, and the beſt Word ſhe can give, is, Soul of a broken Pitcher, Monſter, Brute, Sheep-ſtealer, with a ribble rabble of ſaucy Nick-names that the Devil himſelf would not bear.

old Sayings, a Golden Load makes the Burden light; Gifts will enter Stone-Walls; Scratch my Breech, and I'll claw your Elbow; a Bird in Hand is worth two in the Buſh. Nay, my Maſter too, who, one would think, ſhould tell me a fine Story, and coaks me up with dainty Sugar plumb Words, talks of tying me to a Tree forſooth, and of doubling the Whipping. Odsbobs! methinks thoſe troubleſome People ſhould know who they Prate to. 'Tis not only a Squire Errant they would have to whip himſelf, but a Governour, and is there no more to do, think they, but up and ride? Let 'em e'en learn Manners, with a Pox. There's a time for ſome things, and a time for all things; a time for great things, and a time for ſmall things. Am I now in the humour to hear Petitions, d'ye think? juſt when my Heart's ready to burſt, for having torn my new Coat; they would have me tear my own Fleſh too, in the Devil's Name, when I have no more Stomach to it, than I've to be among the Men-eaters. Upon my Honour <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid the Duke, if you don't re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and become as ſoft as a ripe Fig, you ſhall have no Government. 'Twould be a fine thing indeed that I ſhould ſend among my Iſlanders a mercileſs hard-hearted Tyrant, whom neither the Tears of diſtreſs'd Damſels, nor the Admonitions of Wiſe Ancient and Powerful Inchanters, can move to Compaſſion. In ſhort, Sir, no Stripes, no Government. But quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> mayn't I have a Day or two to Conſider on't? Not a Minute, cry'd <hi>Merlin:</hi> You muſt declare now, and in this very Place what you reſolve to do, for <hi>Dulcinea</hi> muſt be again Transform'd into a Country-Wench, and carried back immediately to <hi>Monteſinos</hi>'s Cave; or elſe ſhe ſhall go as ſhe is now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the <hi>Elyſian Fields,</hi> there to remain till the number of
<pb n="972" facs="tcp:54446:530"/>
the Stripes be made out. Come, come, honeſt <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid the Dutcheſs, pluck up a good Courage, and ſhew your Gratitude to your Maſter, whoſe Bread you have eaten, and to whoſe generous Nature and high Feats of Chivalry we are all ſo much oblig'd: Come, Child, give your Conſent, and make a Fool of the Devil: Hang Fear; faint Heart ne'er won fair Lady; Fortune favours the Brave, as you know better than I can tell you. Hark you, Maſter <hi>Merlin,</hi> (quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> without giving the Dutcheſs an Anſwer) pray will you tell me one thing. How comes it about that this ſame Poſt-Devil that came before you, brought my Maſter Word from Signior <hi>Monteſinos</hi> that he would be here and give him Directions about this Diſinchantment, and yet we hear no News of <hi>Monteſinos</hi> all this while? Pſhaw, anſwer'd <hi>Merlin,</hi> the Devil's an Aſs, and a lying Raſcal; he came from me, and not from <hi>Monteſinos,</hi> for he, poor Man, is ſtill in his Cave expecting the Diſſolution of the Spell that confines him there yet, ſo that he is not quite ready to be free: But if he owes you any Money, or you have any Buſineſs with him, he ſhall be forth-coming when, and where you pleaſe. But now pray make an end, and undergo this ſmall Penance, 'twill do you a World of good; for 'twill not only prove beneficial to your Soul, as an Act of Charity, but alſo to your Body, as a healthy Exerciſe; for you are of a very Sanguine Complection, <hi>Sancho,</hi> and loſing a little Blood will do you no harm.

                        <p>Scarce had <hi>Sancho</hi> ſpoke, when the Muſick ſtruck up again, and a Congratulatory Volley of ſmall Shot was immediately diſcharg'd.

                        <p>THE whole Contrivance of the late Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was Plotted by the Duke's Steward, a Man of Wit, and of a facetious and quick Fancy. He made the Verſes, acted <hi>Merlin</hi> himſelf, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed a Page to perſonate <hi>Dulcinea.</hi> And now by his Maſter's appointment, he prepar'd another Scene of Mirth, as pleaſant and as artful, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing as can be Imagin'd.</p>
                        <p>The next day, the Dutcheſs ask'd <hi>Sancho</hi> whether he had begun his Penitential Task to diſ-inchant <hi>Dulcinea?</hi> Ay marry have I, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> for I have already lent my ſelf five Laſhes on the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks. With what, Friend, ask'd the Dutcheſs? With the Palm of my Hand, anſwer'd <hi>Sancho.</hi> Your Hand! ſaid the Dutcheſs, thoſe are rather Claps than Laſhes, <hi>Sancho;</hi> I doubt Father <hi>Merlin</hi> won't be ſatisfied at ſo eaſy a rate; for the Liberty
<pb n="975" facs="tcp:54446:531"/>
of ſo great a Lady is not to be Purchaſs'd at ſo mean a Price. No, you ſhould Laſh your ſelf with ſomething that may make you ſmart: A good Friar's Scourge, a Cat a nine-tails, or Penitent's Whip, would do well; for Letters written in Blood, ſtand good; but works of Charity faintly and coldly done, loſe their Merit, and ſignify no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Then, Madam quoth he, will your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Grace do ſo much as help me to a convenient Rod, ſuch as you ſhall think beſt; tho' it muſt not be too ſmarting neither: For Faith, tho' I am a Clown, my Fleſh is as ſoft as any Lady's in the Land, no diſparagement to any body's But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks. Well, well <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid ſhe, it ſhall be my Care to provide you a Whip that ſhall ſuit your ſoft Conſtitution as if they were Twins. But now, my dear Madam, quoth he, you muſt know I have written a Letter here to my Wife <hi>Tereſa Pança,</hi> to give her to underſtand how things are with me. I have it in my Boſom, and it's juſt ready to ſend away; it wants nothing but the Deraction on the out-ſide. Now I would have your Wiſdom to read it, and ſee if it be not written like a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; I mean, in ſuch a Style as Governours ſhould write. And who Penn'd it, ask'd the Dutcheſs? What a Queſtion there is now, quoth <hi>Sancho?</hi> Who ſhould Pen it but my ſelf, Sinner as I am? And did you Write it too, ſaid the Dutcheſs? Not I, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> for I can neither Write nor Read; though I can make my Mark. Let's ſee the Letter, ſaid the Dutcheſs, for I dare ſay, your Wit is ſet out in it to ſome purpoſe. <hi>Sancho</hi> pull'd the Letter out of his Boſom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeal'd, and the Dutcheſs having taken it, read what follows.</p>

Thou muſt know, my <hi>Tereſa,</hi> that I am reſolv'd thou ſhalt Ride in a Coach; for now any other way of going, is to me but creeping on all Fours, like a Kitten. Thou art now a Governour's Wife, gueſs whether any one will dare to tread on thy Heels. I have ſent thee a Green Hunting-Suit of Reparel, which my Lady Dutcheſs gave me. Pray ſee and get it turn'd into a Petticoat and Jacket for your Daughter. The Folks in this Country are very ready to talk little good of my Maſter, Don <hi>Quixote.</hi> They ſay he is a mad Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and a pleaſant Mad-man, and that I an't a jot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind-hand with him. We have been in <hi>Monteſinos</hi>'s Cave, and <hi>Merlin</hi> the Wizzard has pitch'd on me to Diſ-inchant <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo,</hi> the ſame who among ye is call'd <hi>Aldonſa Lorenzo.</hi> When I have given my ſelf three Thouſand three Hundred Laſhes, lacking five, ſhe will be as Diſinchanted as the Mother that bore her. But not a Word of the Pudding; for if you tell your Caſe among a parcel of tattling Goſſips, you'll ne'er have done; one will cry 'tis White, and others 'tis Black. I am to go to my Government very ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whither I go with a huge mind to make Money, as I am told all new Governours do. I'll firſt ſee how mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters go, and then ſend thee Word whether thou had'ſt beſt come or no. <hi>Dapple</hi> is well, and gives his humble Service to you. I won't part with him, though I were to be made the <hi>Great Turk.</hi> My Lady Dutcheſs Kiſſes thy Hands a Thouſand times over; pray return her two Thouſand for her one; for there's nothing cheaper than fair Words, as my Maſter ſays. Heaven has not been pleas'd to make me light on another Cloak-Bag, with a

hundred pieces of Gold in it, like thoſe you wot of. But all in good time: Don't let that vex thee, my Jugg, the Government will make it up, I'll warrant thee. Though after all, one thing ſticks plaguily in my Ghiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard: They tell me, that when once I have taſted on't, I ſhall be ready to eat my very Fingers after it, ſo ſavoury is the Sauce. Should it fall out ſo, I ſhould make but an ill hand of it; and yet your maim'd and crippl'd Alms-folk; pick up a pretty Livelihood, and make their Begging as good as a Prebend. So that one way or other, Old Girl, matters will go Swimmingly and thoul't be Rich and Happy. Heaven make thee ſo, as well it may; and keep me for thy Sake.

                        <p>Methinks, Mr. Governour, (ſaid the Dutcheſs, having read the Letter) you are out in two Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars; firſt, when you intimate that this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was beſtow'd on you for the Stripes you are to give your ſelf; whereas you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, it was allotted you before this Diſ-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment was dream'd of. The ſecond Branch that you have fail'd in, is the diſcovery of your Avarice, which is the moſt deteſtable Quality in Governours; becauſe their Self-Intereſt is always Indulg'd at the Expence of Juſtice. You know the Saying, Covetouſneſs breaks the Sack, and that Vice always prompts a Governour to fleece and oppreſs the Subject. Truly, my good Lady, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> I meant no harm, I did not well think of what I wrote, and if your Grace's Worſhip does not like this Letter, I'll tear it, and have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;<pb n="978" facs="tcp:54446:533"/>
but remember the Old Saying, Seldom comes a better. I ſhall make but ſad Work on't, if I muſt pump my Brains for't. No, no, ſaid the Dutcheſs, this will do well enough, and I muſt have the Duke ſee it.</p>
                        <p>They went then into the Garden, where they were to Dine that Day, and there ſhe ſhew'd the Duke the Learned Epiſtle, which he read over with a great deal of Pleaſure.</p>
                        <p>After Dinner, <hi>Sancho</hi> was Entertaining the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany very pleaſantly, with ſome of his ſavoury Diſcourſe, when ſuddenly they were ſurpriz'd with the mornful Sound of a Fife, which play'd in Conſort with a hoarſe unbrac'd Drum. All the Company ſeem'd amaz'd and diſcompos'd at the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſig Noiſe, but Don <hi>Quixote</hi> eſpecially was ſo alarm'd with this ſolmn Martial Harmony, that he could not compoſe his Thoughts. <hi>Sancho's</hi> Fear undoubtedly wrought the uſual Effects, and carried him to crouch by the Dutcheſs.</p>
                        <p>During this Conſternation, two Men in deep Mourning Cloaks trailing on the Ground, enter'd the Garden, each of 'em beating a large Drum cover'd alſo with Black, and with theſe a third playing on a Fife, in Mourning like the reſt. They uſher'd in a Perſon of a Gigantick Stature, to which the long black Garb in which he was wrapp'd up, was no ſmall Addition: It had a Train of a prodigious length, and over the Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſock was girt a broad black Belt, which ſlung a Scimiter of a mighty ſize. His Face was cover'd with a thin black Vail, through which might be diſcern'd a Beard of vaſt length, as white as Snow. The Solemnity of his Pace kept exact Time to the gravity of the Muſick: In ſhort, his Stature, his Motion, his black Hue, and his Attendance, were every way ſuprizing and aſtoniſhing. With
<pb n="979" facs="tcp:54446:533"/>
this State and Formality he approach'd, and fell on his Knees at a convenient diſtance, before the Duke; who not ſuffering him to ſpeak till he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, the Monſtrous Spectre erected his Bulk, and throwing off his Veil, diſcover'd the moſt terrible, hugeous, white, broad, prominent, buſhy Beard, that ever Mortal Eyes were frighted at. Then fixing his Eyes on the Duke, and with a deep Sonorous Voice roaring out from the ample Cavern of his ſpreading Lungs, Moſt High and Potent Lord, cry'd he, my Name is <hi>Trifaldin with the White Beard,</hi> Squire to the Counteſs <hi>Trifaldi,</hi> otherwiſe yclep'd the <hi>Diſconſolate Matron,</hi> from whom I am Ambaſſador to your Grace, begging Admittance for her Ladyſhip to come and relate before your Magnificence the unhappy and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Circumſtances of her Misfortune. But firſt ſhe deſires to be Inform'd whether the Valorous and Invincible Knight Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha</hi> reſides at this time in your Caſtle; for 'tis in Queſt of him that my Lady has Travell'd without Coach or Palfrey, Hungry and Thirſty, and in ſhort, without breaking her Faſt, from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Candaya,</hi> all the way to theſe your Grace's Territories: A thing incredibly Miraculous, if not wrought by Inchantment. She is now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Gate of this Caſtle, waiting only for your Grace's Permiſſion to enter. This ſaid, the Squire Cough'd, and ſtroak'd his unweildy Beard from the top to the bottom, and with a formal gravity expected the Duke's Anſwer.</p>
                        <p>Worthy Squire <hi>Trifaldin with the white Beard,</hi> ſaid the Duke, long ſince have we heard the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes of the Counteſs <hi>Trifaldi,</hi> whom Inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="980" facs="tcp:54446:534"/>
and that the Valiant Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha</hi> is here preſent, on whoſe Generous Aſſiſtance ſhe may ſafely rely for Redreſs. Inform her alſo from me, That, if ſhe has occaſion for my Aid, ſhe may depend on my readineſs to do her Service, being oblig'd as I'm a Knight, to be Aiding and Aſſiſting, to the utmoſt of my Power, to all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of her Sex, in diſtreſs, eſpecially Widow'd Matrons, like her Ladyſhip.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Trifaldin</hi> hearing this, made his Obeiſance with the Knee, and Beckoning to the Fife and Drums to obſerve his Motion, they all March'd out in the ſame Solemn Proceſſion as they Enter'd, and left all the Beholders in a deep Admiration of his Proportion and Deportment.</p>
                        <p>Then the Duke turning to Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> Behold, Sir Knight, ſaid he, how the Light and Glory of Vertue dart their Beams through the Clouds of Malice and Ignorance, and Shine to the remoteſt Parts of the Earth: 'Tis hardly ſix Days ſince you have vouchſaf'd to Honour this Caſtle with your Preſence, and already the Afflicted and Diſtreſs'd flock hither from the uttermoſt Regions, not in Coaches, or on Dromedaries, but on Foot, and without Eating by the Way; ſuch is their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the Strength of that Arm, the Fame of whoſe great Exploits flies and ſpreads every where, and makes the whole World acquainted with your Valour.</p>
                        <p>What would I give, my Lord, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> that the ſame Holy Pedant were here now, who t'other Day at your Table wou'd have run down Knight-Errantry at ſuch a Rate; that the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his own Eyes might convince him of the Abſurdity of his Error, and let him ſee, that the Comfortleſs, and Afflicted do not in Enormous Misfortunes, and uncommon Adverſity, repair for
<pb n="981" facs="tcp:54446:534"/>
Redreſs to the Doors of droning Church-men, or your little Sacriſtans of Villages; nor to the Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of your Country-Gentleman, who never Travels beyond his Land-mark; nor to the lolling, lazy Courtier, who rather hearkens after News, which he may relate, than endeavours to perform ſuch Deeds as may deſerve to be Recorded and Related. No, the Protection of Damſels, the Comfort of Widows, the Redreſs of the Injur'd, and the ſupport of the Diſtreſs'd, are no where ſo perfectly to be expected as from the generous Profeſſors of Knight-Errantry. Therefore I thank Heaven a thouſand Times, for having qualify'd me to Anſwer the Neceſſities of the Miſerable by ſuch a Function. As for the hardſhips and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents that may attend me, I look on 'em as no Diſcouragements, ſince proceeding from ſo noble a Cauſe. Then let this Matron be admitted to make known her Requeſt, and I will refer her for Redreſs to the Force of my Arm, and the Intrepid Reſolution of my Courageous Soul.</p>

                           </gap>ary that talk'd like a Canary-Bird, and us'd to ſay, Where-ever come old Waiting-Women, good Luck can happen there to no Man. Body of me, he knew 'em too well, and therefore valu'd 'em ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. He cou'd have eaten 'em all with a Grain of Salt. Since then the beſt of 'em are ſo plaguy troubleſome and impertinent, what will thoſe be that are in doleful Dumps, like this ſame Counteſs Three Folds, Three Skirts, or Three Tails, what d'ye call her? Hold your Tongue <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quixote.</hi> This Matron that comes ſo far in Search of me, lives too remote to lie under the Laſh of the Apothecary's Satyr. Beſides, you are to remember ſhe's a Counteſs, and when Ladies of that Quality become <hi>Governantes</hi> or Waiting-Women,
<pb n="983" facs="tcp:54446:535"/>
'tis only to Queens or Empreſſes; and in their own Houſes they are as abſolute Ladies as any others, and attended by other Waiting-Women. Ay, ay, (cry'd Donna <hi>Rodriguez,</hi> who was preſent) there are ſome that ſerve my Lady Dutcheſs here in that Capacity, that might have been Counteſſes too had they had better Luck. But we are not all born to be rich, tho' we are all born to be honeſt. Let no Body then ſpeak ill of Waiting Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, eſpecially of thoſe that are ancient and Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens; for though I am none of thoſe, I eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Advantage that a Waiting Gentlewoman, who is a Maiden, has over one that is a Widow. When all's ſaid, whoever will offer to meddle with Waiting-Women will get little by't. Many go out for Wooll, and come home ſhorn themſelves. For all that, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> your Waiting-Women are not ſo bare but that they may be ſhorn, if my Barber ſpoke Truth: So that they had beſt not ſtir the Rice, though it ſticks to the Pot. Theſe Squires forſooth, anſwer'd Donna <hi>Rodriguez,</hi> muſt be always cocking up their Noſes againſt us: As they are always haunting the Anti-Chambers, like a Parcel of evil Sprights as they are, they ſee us whisk in and out at all Times; ſo when they are not tumbling their Beads, which, Heaven knows, is moſt Part of the Day, they can find no other Paſtime than to abuſe us, and tell idle Stories of us, unburying our Bones, and burying our Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. But their Tongues are no Slander, and I can tell thoſe ſilly Rake-ſhames, that in ſpight of their Flouts we ſhall keep the upper Hand of 'em, and live in the World in the better ſort of Houſes, though we ſtarve for't; and cover our Fleſh, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delicate or not, with black Gowns, as they cover a Dunghil with a Piece of Hanging when a Proceſſion goes by. S'Life, Sir, were this a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="984" facs="tcp:54446:536"/>
Time, I would convince you and all the World, that there's no Virtue but is enclos'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Stays of a Waiting-Woman. I fancy, ſaid the Dutcheſs, that honeſt <hi>Rodriguez</hi> is much in the Right: But we muſt now chuſe a fitter Time for this Diſpute, to confound the ill Opinion of that wicked Apothecary, and to root out that which the great <hi>Sancho Pança</hi> has fix'd in his Breaſt. For my Part, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I won't diſpute with her; for ſince the Thoughts of being a Governour have ſteam'd up into my Brains, all my Concern for the Squire is vaniſh'd into Smoak; and I care not a wild Fig for all the Waiting-Women in the World.</p>
                        <p>This Subject would have engag'd 'em longer in Diſcourſe, had they not been cut ſhort by the Sound of the Fife and Drums, that gave 'em No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the <hi>diſconſolate Matron</hi>'s Approach. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Dutcheſs ask'd the Duke how it might be proper to receive her? and how far Ceremony was due to her Quality as a Counteſs? Look you (quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſtriking in before the Duke could anſwer) I would adviſe ye to meet her Counteſsſhip half way, but for the Waiting-Womanſhip don't ſtir a Step. Who bids you trouble your ſelf? ſaid Don <hi>Quixote.</hi> Who bid me! anſwer'd <hi>Sancho;</hi> why I my ſelf did. Ha'n't I been Squire to your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and thus ſerv'd a Prenticeſhip to good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? and ha'n't I had the Flower of Courteſy for my Maſter, who has often told me, A Man may as well loſe at One and Thirty with a Card too much as a Card too little? Good Wits jump; a Word to the Wiſe is enough. <hi>Sancho</hi> ſays well, ſaid the Duke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To decide the Matter, we will firſt ſee what kind of a Counteſs ſhe is, and behave our ſelves accordingly.</p>

                        <p>THE doleful Drums and Fife were follow'd by twelve elderly Waiting-Women that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd the Garden, rank'd in Pairs, all clad in large mourning Habits, that ſeem'd to be of mill'd Serge, over which they wore Veils of white Callicoe, ſo long that nothing could be ſeen of their black Dreſs but the very Bottom. After them came the Counteſs <hi>Trifaldi,</hi> handed by her Squire <hi>Trifaldin with the White Beard.</hi> The Lady was dreſs'd in a Suit of the fineſt Bays, which, had it been napp'd, would have had Tufts as big as Rouncival-Peaſe. Her Train or Tail, which you will, was mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically divided into three equal Skirts or Angles, and born up by three Pages in Mourning; and from this pleaſant triangular Figure of her Train, as every one conjectur'd, was ſhe call'd <hi>Trifaldi;</hi> as who ſhould ſay, the Counteſs of <hi>Three Folds,</hi> or <hi>Three Skirts. Benengely</hi> is of the ſame Opinion, tho' he affirms that her true Title was the Counteſs <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buna,</hi> or of <hi>Wolf-Land,</hi> from the Abundance of Wolves bred in her Country; and had they been
<pb n="986" facs="tcp:54446:537"/>
Foxes, ſhe had, by the ſame Rule, been call'd the Counteſs <hi>Zorruna,</hi> or of <hi>Fox-Land;</hi> it being a Cuſtom in thoſe Nations, for great Perſons to take their Denominations from that Commodity with which their Country moſt abounds. However, this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs choſe to borrow her Title from this new Faſhion of her own Invention, and leaving her Name of <hi>Lobuna,</hi> took that of <hi>Trifaldi.</hi>

                        <p>Her twelve Female Attendants approach'd with her in a Proceſſion-pace, with black Veils over their Faces, not Tranſparent, like that of <hi>Trifaldin,</hi> but thick enough to hinder altogether the ſight of their Countenances. As ſoon as the whole Train of Waiting-women was come in, the Duke and the Dutcheſs, and Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ſtood up, and ſo did all thoſe who were with 'em. Then the twelve Women ranging themſelves in two Rows, made a Lane for the Counteſs to March up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 'em; which ſhe did, ſtill led by <hi>Trifaldin,</hi> her Squire. The Duke, the Dutcheſs, and Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> advancing about a dozen Paces to meet her, ſhe fell on her Knees, and with a Voice rather hoarſe and rough, than clear and delicate, may it pleaſe your Highneſſes, ſaid ſhe, to ſpare your ſelves the trouble of receiving with ſo much Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and Compliment a Man (Woman I would ſay) who is your devoted Servant. Alas! The Senſe of my Misfortunes has ſo troubl'd my Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuals, that my Reſponſes cannot be ſuppos'd able to anſwer the critical Opinion of your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. My Underſtanding has forſook me, and is gone a Wool-gathering, and ſure 'tis far remote; for the more I ſeek it, the more unlikely I am to find it again. The greateſt Claim, Madam, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd the Duke, that we can lay to Senſe, is a due Reſpect, and decent Deference to the Worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your Perſon, which, without any further
<pb n="987" facs="tcp:54446:537"/>
View, ſufficiently beſpeaks your Merit and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Qualifications. Then begging the Honour of her Hand, he led her up, and plac'd her in a Chair by his Dutcheſs, who receiv'd her with all the Ceremony ſuitable to the Occaſion.</p>
                        <p>Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ſaid nothing all this while, and <hi>Sancho</hi> was ſneaking about, and peeping under the Vails of the Lady's Women; but to no purpoſe, for they kept themſelves very cloſe and ſilent, till ſhe at laſt thus began: I am confident, thrice Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Lord, thrice Beautiful Lady, and thrice In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Auditors, that my moſt unfortunate Miſerableneſs ſhall find in your moſt generous and compaſſionate Bowels, a moſt Miſericordial Sanctuary; my Miſerableneſs, which is ſuch as would liquify Marble, malleate Steel, and mollify Adam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But before the Rehearſal of my ineffable Misfortunes enters, I won't ſay your Ears, but the publick Mart of your hearing Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I earneſtly requeſt, that I may have Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance, whether the Cabal, Choir, or Conclave of this Illuſtriſſimous Appearance be not adorn'd with the Preſence of the Adjutoriferous Don <hi>Quixote de la Manchiſſima,</hi> and his Squiriſſimous <hi>Pança? Pança</hi> is at your <hi>Elbowiſſimous</hi> (quoth <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> before any body elſe could anſwer) and Don <hi>Quixotiſſimo</hi> likewiſe: Therefore, moſt dolorous <hi>Medem,</hi> you may tell out your Teale; for we are all ready to be your Ladiſhip's <hi>Servitoriſſimous</hi> to the beſt of our <hi>Cepecities,</hi> and ſo forth. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> then advanc'd, and addreſſing the Counteſs, if your Misfortunes, Embarraſs'd Lady, ſaid he, may hope any Redreſs from the Power and Aſſiſtance of Knight-Errantry, I offer you my Force and Courage, and ſuch as they are, I dedicate 'em to your Service I am Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha;</hi> whoſe Profeſſion is a ſufficient Obligation to Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour

                        <p>The Lady hearing this, threw herſelf at Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Feet, in ſpight of his kind Endeavours to the contrary, and ſtriving to embrace 'em, moſt invincible Knight, ſaid ſhe, I Proſtrate my ſelf at theſe Feet, the Foundations and Pillars of Chival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-Errant, the ſupporters of my drooping Spirits, whoſe Indefatigable Steps alone can haſten my Relief, and the cure of my Afflictions. O Valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Errant, whoſe real Atchievements Eclipſe and Obſcure the Fabulous Legends of the <hi>Amadiſes, Eſplandians,</hi> and <hi>Belianiſes!</hi> Then turning from Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> ſhe laid hold on <hi>Sancho,</hi> and ſquee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing his Hands very hard, and thou, the moſt Loyal Squire, that ever attended on the Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Knight-Errantry, whoſe goodneſs is more Extenſive than the Beard of my Uſher <hi>Trifaldin!</hi> How happily have thy Stars plac'd thee, under the Diſcipline of the whole Martial College of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry Profeſſors, centr'd and Epitomiz'd in the ſingle Don <hi>Quixote!</hi> I conjure thee by thy love of Goodneſs, and thy unſpotted Loyalty to ſo great a Maſter, to employ thy moving and Interceding Eloquence in my behalf, that eftſoons his Favour may ſhine upon this humble, and moſt diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Counteſs.</p>
                        <p>Look you, Madam Counteſs, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> as for meaſuring my Goodneſs by your Squire's Beard, that's neither here nor there; ſo my Soul go to

Heav'n when I depart this Life, I don't matter the reſt; for, as for the Beards of this World, 'tis not what I ſtand upon; ſo that without all this Pawing and Wheedling, I'll put in a Word for you to my Maſter. I know he loves me, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides at this time he ſtands in need of me about a certain Buſineſs, and he ſhall do what he can for you. But pray diſcharge your burden'd Mind; unload, and let us ſee what Griefs you bring, and then leave us to take care of the reſt.</p>
                        <p>The Duke and Dutcheſs were ready to burſt with Laughing, to find the Adventure run in this pleaſant Strain; and they admir'd at the ſame time, the rare Cunning and Management of <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faldi,</hi> who re-aſſuming her Seat, thus began her Story.</p>
                        <p>The famous Kingdom of <hi>Candaya,</hi> Situated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the great <hi>Taprobana</hi> and the South Sea, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two Leagues beyond <hi>Cape Comorin,</hi> had for its Queen, the Lady <hi>Donna Maguntia,</hi> whoſe Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band King <hi>Archipielo</hi> dying, left the Princeſs <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonomaſia,</hi> their only Child, Heireſs to the Crown. This Princeſs was Educated, and brought up under my Care and Direction; I being the Eldeſt, and firſt Lady of the Bed-Chamber to the Queen, her Mother. In Proceſs of time, the young Princeſs arriv'd at the Age of fourteen Years, and appear'd ſo perfectly Beautiful, that it was not in the Power of Nature to give any Addition to her Charms. What's yet more, her Mind was no leſs adorn'd than her Body. Wiſdom it ſelf was but a Fool to her: She was no leſs Diſcreet than Fair, and the faireſt Creature in the World; and ſo ſhe is ſtill, unleſs the fatal Knife, or unrelenting Sheers of the envious and inflexible Siſters have cut her Thread of Life. But ſure the Heavens wou'd not permit ſuch an Injury to be done to the
<pb n="990" facs="tcp:54446:539"/>
Earth, as the untimely Lopping of the lovelieſt Branch that ever Adorn'd the Garden of the World.</p>
                        <p>Her Beauty, which my unpoliſh'd Tongue can never ſufficiently Praiſe, attracting all Eyes, ſoon got her a World of Adorers, many of 'em Princes, who were her Neighbours, and more diſtant Foreigners. Among the reſt, a Private Knight, who reſided at Court, was ſo Audacious as to raiſe his Thoughts to that Heaven of Beauty. This young Gentleman was indeed Maſter of all Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantries that the Air of his Courtly Education cou'd Inſpire; and ſo confiding on his Youth, his handſome Mein, his agreeable Air, and Dreſs, his graceful Carriage, and the Charms of his eaſy Wit, and other Qualifications, he follow'd the Impulſe of his Inordinate and moſt Preſumptuous Paſſion. I muſt needs ſay, that he was an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Perſon, he play'd to a Miracle on the Guit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and made it ſpeak not only to the Ears, but to the very Soul. He danc'd to Admiration, and had ſuch a rare Knack at making of Bird-Cages, that he might have got an Eſtate by that very Art; and to ſum up all his Accompliſhments, he was a Poet. So many Parts and Endowments were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to have mov'd a Mountain, and much more the Heart of a Young, tender Virgin. But all his fine Arts and ſoothing Behaviour had prov'd In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual againſt the Vertue and Reſervedneſs of my Beautiful Charge, if the Damn'd cunning Rogue had not firſt Conquer'd me. The deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Villain endeavour'd to ſeduce the Keeper, ſo to ſecure the Keys of the Fortreſs: In ſhort, he ſo ply'd me with pleaſing Trifles, and ſo inſinuated himſelf into my Soul, that at laſt he perfectly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch'd me, and made me give way before I was aware, to what I ſhould never have permitted.
<pb n="991" facs="tcp:54446:539"/>
But that which firſt wrought me to his Purpoſe, and undermin'd my Vertue, was a curſed Copy of Verſes he ſung one Night under my Window, which, if I remember right, began thus.</p>

In ſhort, I procur'd him Admittance, and by my Connivance, he very often had Natural Familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with <hi>Antonomaſia,</hi> who, poor Lady, was rather deluded by me, than by him.

Lady was ſo much out of the Way neither, that the Mother ſhould lay it ſo grievouſly to Heart. Indeed had ſhe marry'd a Foot-man or ſome other Servant in the Family, as I'm told many others have done, it had been a very bad Buſineſs, and paſt curing; but for the Queen to make ſuch a heavy out-cry when her Daughter marry'd ſuch a fine-bred young Knight, Faith and Troth I think the Buſineſs had better been made up. 'Twas a ſlip, but not ſuch a hainous one, as one would think: For as my Maſter here ſays, and he won't let me tell a Lie, as of Scholars they make Biſhops, ſo of your Knights (chiefly if they be Errant) one may eaſily make Kings and Emperours.</p>
                        <p>That's moſt certain, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> turn a Knight-Errant looſe into the wide World with two penny-worth of good Fortune, and he's in <hi>potentia propinqua, (proxima</hi> I would ſay) the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Emperour in the World. But let the Lady proceed; for hitherto her Story has been very pleaſant, and I doubt the moſt bitter part of it is ſtill untold. The moſt bitter truly, Sir, anſwer'd ſhe; and ſo bitter, that Worm-wood and every bitter Herb, compar'd to it, are as ſweet as Honey.</p>
                        <p>The Queen being really dead continu'd ſhe, and not in a Trance, we bury'd her, and ſcarce had we done her the laſt Offices, and taken our laſt leaves, when (<hi>Quis talia fando temperet a Lachrymis?</hi> Who can relate ſuch Woes, and not be drown'd in Tears?) The Giant <hi>Malambruno,</hi> Couſin-german to the deceas'd Queen, who, beſides his native Cruelty, was alſo a Magician, appear'd upon her Grave mounted on a Wooden Horſe, and by his dreadful angry Looks ſhew'd he came thither to Revenge the Death of his Relation, by Puniſhing Don <hi>Clavijo</hi> for his Preſumption, and <hi>Antonomaſta</hi>

for her overſight. Accordingly he immediately Inchanted them both upon the very Tomb, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming her into a Brazen Female Monkey, and the young Knight into a hideous Crocodile of an unknown Metal, and between them both he ſet an Inſcription in the <hi>Syriack</hi> Tongue, which we have got ſince Tranſlated into the <hi>Candayan,</hi> and then into <hi>Spaniſh</hi> to this Effect.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Theſe two preſumptuous Lovers ſhall never recover their Natural Shapes, till the Valorous Knight of</hi> la Mancha <hi>enter into a ſingle Combat with me: For by the irrevoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Decrees of Fate this unheard of Adventure is reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for his unheard of Courage.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This done, he drew a broad Scimiter of a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Size, and catching me faſt by the Hair, made an offer to cut my Throat, or to whip off my Head. I was frighted almoſt to Death, my Hair ſtood an end, and my Tongue cleav'd to the Root of my Mouth. However, recovering my ſelf as well as I could, Trembling and Weeping I begg'd Mercy in ſuch a moving Accent, and in ſuch tender melting Words, that at laſt my Entreaties prevail'd on him to ſtop the cruel Execution. In ſhort, be order'd all the Waiting-women at Court to be brought before him, the ſame that you ſee here at preſent; and after he had aggravated our Breach of Truſt, and rail'd againſt the deceitful Practices, mercenary Procuring, and what elſe he could urge in Scandal of our Profeſſion, and its very Being, reviling us for the Fact of which I alone ſtood guilty; I will not puniſh you with inſtant Death, ſaid he, but inflict a Puniſhment which ſhall be a laſting and eternal Mortification.

to our Faces, we found 'em as you ſhall ſee 'em immediately; ſaying this, the <hi>Diſconſolate Matron</hi> and her Attendance throwing off their Veils, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd their Faces all rough with briſtly Beards, ſome red, ſome black, ſome white, and others motley. The Duke and Dutcheſs admir'd, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> were aſtoniſh'd, and the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders-by were Thunder-ſtruck. Thus, ſaid the Counteſs proceeding, has that murdering and bloody-minded <hi>Malambruno</hi> ſerv'd us, and planted theſe rough and horrid Briſtles on our Faces, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe moſt delicately ſmooth. Oh that he had chopp'd off our Heads with his monſtrous Scimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, rather than to have diſgrac'd our Faces with theſe Bruſhes upon 'em! For, Gentlemen, if you rightly conſider it, and truly, what I have to ſay ſhould be attended with a Flood of Tears; but ſuch Rivers and Oceans have fall'n from me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready upon this doleful Subject, that my Eyes are as dry as Chaff; and therefore pray let me ſpeak without Tears at this time.

                           <hi>CHAP. XL.</hi> Of ſome Things that relate to this Adventure, and appertain to this memorable Hiſtory.</head>
                        <p>ALL Perſons that love to read Hiſtories of the nature of this, muſt certainly be very much obliged to <hi>Cid Hamet</hi> the original Author, who has taken ſuch Care in delivering every minute Particular diſtinctly entire, without concealing the leaſt Circumſtance that might heighten the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, or, if omitted, have obſcur'd the Light and Truth of the Story. He draws lively Pictures of the Thoughts, diſcovers the Imaginations, ſatisfies Curioſity in Secrets, clears Doubts, reſolves Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and in ſhort, makes manifeſt the leaſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of the moſt inquiſitive Deſire! O moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Author! O Fortunate Don <hi>Quixote!</hi> O Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown'd <hi>Dulcinea!</hi> O Facetious <hi>Sancho!</hi> jointly and ſeverally may you live and continue to the lateſt Poſterity, for the general Delight and Recreation of Mankind— but the Story goes on—</p>
                        <p>Now, on my honeſt Word, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> when he ſaw the Matron in a Swoon, and by the Blood of all the <hi>Pança</hi>'s my Fore-fathers, I never heard nor ſaw the like, neither did my Maſter ever tell me, or ſo much as conceit in that working Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece of his, ſuch an Adventure as this. Now all the Devils in Hell (and I would not curſe any Body) run away with thee for an Inchanting Son of a Whore, thou damn'd Giant <hi>Malambruno!</hi> Could'ſt thou find no other Puniſhment for theſe
<pb n="999" facs="tcp:54446:543"/>
poor Sinners, but by clapping Scrubbing-Bruſhes about their Muzzles, with a Pox to you? Had it not been much better to ſlit their Noſtrils half way up their Noſes, though they had ſnuffl'd for it a little, than to have planted theſe quick-ſet Hedges o'er their Chaps? I'll lay any Man a Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger now, the poor Devils have not Money enough to pay for their Shaving.</p>
                        <p>'Tis but too true, Sir, ſaid one of them, we have not wherewithal to pay for taking our Beards off; ſo that ſome of us, to ſave Charges, are forc'd to lay on Plaiſters of Pitch that pull away Roots and all, and leave our Chins as ſmooth as the Bottom of a Stone-Mortar. There is indeed a ſort of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in <hi>Candaya,</hi> that go about from Houſe to Houſe, to take off the Hairs that grow about the Face, trim the Eye-brows, and do twenty other little private Jobs for the Women; but we here that wait on my Lady, never dar'd to have any thing to do with them; for they have got ill Names; for though formerly they got free Acceſs, and paſs'd for Relations, now they are look'd upon to be no better than Bawds. So if my Lord Don <hi>Quixote</hi> do not relieve us, our Beards will ſtick by us as long as we live. I'll have mine pluck'd off Hair by Hair 'among the <hi>Moors,</hi> anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than not free you from yours. Ah Valorous Knight! (cry'd the Counteſs <hi>Trifaldi,</hi> recovering that Moment from her Fit) the ſweet Sound of your Promiſe reach'd my Hearing in the very midſt of my Trance, and has perfectly reſtor'd my Senſes. I beſeech you therefore once again, moſt Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sir, and invincible Errant, that your gracious Promiſe may ſoon have the wiſh'd for effect. I'll be guilty of no Neglect, Madam, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote:</hi> Point out the way, and you ſhall ſoon be convinc'd of my readineſs to ſerve you.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="1000" facs="tcp:54446:544"/>You muſt know then, Sir, ſaid the Diſconſolate Lady, from this Place to the Kingdom of <hi>Candaya</hi> by Computation we reckon five thouſand Leagues, two or three more or leſs. But if you ride through the Air in a direct Line, 'tis not above three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred and twenty ſeven. You are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to underſtand, that <hi>Malambruno</hi> told me, that when Fortune ſhould make me find out the Knight who is to diſſolve our Inchantment, he would ſend him a famous Steed, much eaſier and leſs reſty and full of Tricks, than thoſe Jades that are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let out to Hire, as being the ſame wooden Horſe that carry'd the Valorous <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Provence,</hi> and the Fair <hi>Magalona,</hi> when he ſtole her away. 'Tis manag'd by a wooden Peg in its Forehead, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Bridle, and flies as ſwiftly through the Air, as if all the Devils in Hell were ſwitching him, or blowing Fire in his Tail. This Courſer Tradition delivers, to have been the Handy-work of the Sage <hi>Merlin,</hi> who never lent him to any but particular Friends, or when he was paid Sauce for him. Among others, his Friend <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Provence</hi> borrow'd him, and by the help of his wonderful Speed, ſtole away the fair <hi>Magalona,</hi> as I ſaid, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her behind on the Crupper (for you muſt know he carries double), and ſo tow'ring up in the Air, he left the People, that ſtood near the Place whence he ſtarted, gaping, ſtaring, and amaz'd.</p>
                        <p>Since that Journey, we have heard of no Body that has Back'd him. But this we know, that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lambruno</hi> ſince that got him by his Art; and has us'd him ever ſince, to poſt about to all Parts of the World. He's here to Day, and to Morrow in <hi>France,</hi> and the next Day in <hi>America:</hi> And one of the beſt Properties of the Horſe is, that he coſts not a Farthing in keeping; for he neithet eats not ſleeps, neither needs he any Shooing; beſides, be
<pb n="1001" facs="tcp:54446:544"/>
ambles ſo very eaſy through the Air, that you might carry in your Hand a Cup full of Water a thouſand Leagues and not ſpill a Drop; ſo that the fair <hi>Magalona</hi> lov'd mightily to ride him.</p>
                        <p>Nay, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> as for an eaſy Pacer, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend me to my <hi>Dapple.</hi> Indeed he's none of your High-Flyers, he can't gallop in the Air; but on the King's High-way, he ſhall pace ye with the beſt Ambler that ever went on four Legs. This ſet the whole Company a laughing. But then the diſconſolate Lady going on; This Horſe, ſaid ſhe, will certainly be here within half an hour after 'tis dark, if <hi>Malambruno</hi> deſigns to put an end to our Misfortunes, for that was the Sign by which I ſhould diſcover my Deliverer. And pray, forſooth, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> how many will this ſame Horſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry upon Occaſion? Two, anſwer'd ſhe, one in the Saddle, and t'other behind on the Crupper; and thoſe two are commonly the Knight and the Squire, if ſome ſtolen Damſel be not to be one. Good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate Madam, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I'd fain know the Name of this ſame Nag. The Horſe's Name, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd ſhe, is neither <hi>Pegaſus</hi> like <hi>Bellerophon</hi>'s; nor <hi>Bucephalus</hi> like <hi>Alexander</hi>'s; nor <hi>Brilladoro</hi> like <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lando</hi>'s; nor <hi>Bayard</hi> like <hi>Rinaldo</hi>'s; nor <hi>Frontin</hi> like <hi>Rogero</hi>'s; nor <hi>Bootes,</hi> nor <hi>Pyrithous</hi> like the Horſes of the Sun; neither is he call'd <hi>Orelia,</hi> like the Horſe which <hi>Rodrigo,</hi> the laſt King of <hi>Spain</hi> of the <hi>Gothick</hi> Race, beſtrid that unfortunate Day, when he loſt the Battle the Kingdom and his Life. I'll lay you a Wager, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſince the Horſe goes by none of thoſe famous Names, he does not go by that of <hi>Roſinante</hi> neither, which is my Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters's Horſe, and another-gueſs Beaſt than any you've reckon'd up. 'Tis very right, anſwer'd the Bearded Lady. However, he has a very proper and ſignificant Name; for he is call'd <hi>Clavileno<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> or
<pb n="1002" facs="tcp:54446:545"/>
                           <hi>Wooden-Peg</hi> the <hi>Swift,</hi> from the Wooden Peg in his Forehead; ſo that for Significancy of Name at leaſt he may be compared with <hi>Roſinante.</hi> I find no Fault with his Name, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but what kind of Bridle or Halter do you manage him with? I told you already, reply'd ſhe, that he is guided with the Peg, which being turned this way or that way, he moves accordingly, either mounting aloft in the Air, or almoſt bruſhing and ſweeping the Ground, or elſe flying in the middle Region, the way which ought indeed moſt to be choſen in all Affairs of Life. I ſhould be glad to ſee this nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Tit, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but don't deſign to get on his Back, either before or behind. No, by my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Dame, you may as well expect Pears from an Elm: 'Twere a pretty Jeſt, I trow, for me that can hardly ſit my own <hi>Dapple,</hi> with a Pack-Saddle as ſoft as Silk, to ſuffer my ſelf to be hors'd upon a hard wooden thing without either Cuſhion or Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low under my Buttocks. Before <hi>George!</hi> I won't gall my Back-ſide to take off the beſt Lady's Beard in the Land. Let them that have Beards wear 'em ſtill, or get them whipp'd off as they think beſt, I'll not take ſuch a long Jaunt with my Maſter, not I There's no need of me in this ſhaving of Beards, as there was in <hi>Dulcinea</hi>'s Buſineſs. Upon my Word, dear Sir, but there is, reply'd <hi>Trifaldi,</hi> and ſo much that without you nothing can be done. God ſave the King! cry'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> what have we Squires to do with our Maſters Adventures? We muſt bear the Trouble forſooth, and they run away with the Credit! Body o' me, 'twere ſomething, would thoſe that write their Stories but give the Squires their due Share in their Books; as thus, <hi>Such a Knight ended ſuch an Adventure; but it was with the help of ſuch a one his Squire, without which the Devil a bit could he ever have done it.</hi> But, they ſhall barely tell
<pb n="1003" facs="tcp:54446:545"/>
you in their Hiſtories, Sir <hi>Paralipomenon, Knight of the Three Stars, ended the Adventure of the Six Hobgob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins.</hi> And not a Word all the while of his Squire's Perſon, as if there were no ſuch Man, though he was by all the while, poor Devil. In ſhort good People, I don't like it, and once more I ſay, my Maſter may e'en go by himſelf for <hi>Sancho,</hi> and Joy betide him. I'll ſtay and keep Madam Dutcheſs Company here, and mayhap by that time he comes back, he'll find his Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi>'s Buſineſs pretty forward; for I mean to give my bare Breech a jirking till I bruſh off the very Hair, at idle Times, that is, and when I've nothing elſe to do.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheleſs, honeſt <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid the Dutcheſs, if your Company be neceſſary in this Adventure, you muſt go; for all good People will make it their Buſineſs to entreat you, and 'twou'd look ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill, that through your vain Fears theſe poor Gentlewomen ſhould remain thus with rough and briſtly Faces. God ſave the King, I cry again, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> were it a piece of Charity for the Relief of ſome good ſober Gentlewomen, or poor innocent Hoſpital-Girls, ſomething might be ſaid. But to gall my Back-ſide, and venture my Neck to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beard a Pack of idling trolloping Chamber-jades, with a Murrain! Not I, let 'em go elſewhere for a Shaver, I wiſh I might ſee the whole Tribe of 'em wear Beards from the higheſt to the loweſt, from the proudeſt to the primeſt, all hairy like ſo many She-goats. You are very angry with Wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Women, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid the Dutcheſs: That Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary has inſpir'd you with this bitter Spirit. But you're to blame, Friend; for I'll aſſure you there are ſome in my Family, that may ſerve for Patterns of Diſcretion to all thoſe of their Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and Donna <hi>Rodriguez</hi> here will let me ſay no loſs. Ay, ay, Madam, ſaid Donna <hi>Rodriguez;</hi> your
<pb n="1004" facs="tcp:54446:546"/>
Grace may ſay what you pleaſe: This is a cenſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous World we live in, but Heaven knows all; and whether good or bad, bearded or unbearded, we Waiting-Gentlewomen had Mothers as well as the reſt of our Sex; and ſince Providence has made us as we are, and plac'd us in the World, it knows wherefore, and ſo we truſt in its Mercy, and no body's Beard? Enough, Donna <hi>Rodriguez,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> as for you, Lady <hi>Trifaldi,</hi> and other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed Matrons, I hope that Heaven will ſpeedily look with a pitying Eye on your Sorrows, and that <hi>Sancho</hi> will do as I ſhall deſire. I only wiſh <hi>Clavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leno</hi> wou'd once come, that I may encounter <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lambruno;</hi> for I am ſure no Razor ſhould be more expeditious in ſhaving your Ladyſhip's Beard, than my Sword to ſhave that Giant's Head from his Shoulders: Heaven may a while permit the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but not for ever.</p>
                        <p>Ah! moſt valorous Champion, ſaid the Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate Matron, may all the Stars in the Celeſtial Regions ſhed their moſt propitious Influence on your generous Valour, which thus ſupports the Cauſe of our unfortunate Office, ſo expos'd to the poiſonous Rancour of Apothecaries, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil'd by ſaucy Grooms and Squires. Now all ill Luck attend the low-ſpirited Quean, who, in the Flower of her Youth, will not rather chuſe to turn Nun, than Waiting-Woman! Poor forlorn contemn'd Creatures as we are! tho' deſcended in a direct Line from Father to Son, from <hi>Hector</hi> of <hi>Troy</hi> himſelf, yet would not our Ladies find a more civil way to ſpeak to us, than <hi>Thee</hi> and <hi>Thou,</hi> though it were to gain 'em a Kingdom. O Giant <hi>Malam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruno!</hi> thou, who though an Inchanter, art always moſt faithful to thy Word, ſend us the peerleſs <hi>Clavileno,</hi> that our Misfortunes may have an end. For if the Weather grows hotter than it is, and

                        <p>The Diſconſolate Lady utter'd theſe Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in ſo pathetick a manner, that the Tears of all the Spectators waited on her Complaints; and even <hi>Sancho</hi> himſelf began to water his Plants, and condeſcend at laſt to ſhare in the Adventure, and attend his Maſter to the very fag-end of the World, ſo he might contribute to the clearing away the Weeds that over-ſpread thoſe Venerable Faces.</p>

                        <p>THeſe Diſcourſes brought on the Night, and with it the appointed Time for the famous <hi>Clavileno</hi>'s Arrival. Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> very impatient at his Delay, began to fear, that either he was not the Knight for whom this Adventure was reſerv'd, or elſe that the Giant <hi>Malambruno</hi> had not Courage to enter into a ſingle Combat with him. But un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly who ſhould enter the Garden but four Savages cover'd with green Ivy, bearing on their Shoulders a large Wooden Horſe, which they ſet upon his Legs before the Company; and then one of them cry'd out, Now let him that has the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage mount this Engine— I am not he, quoth<pb n="1006" facs="tcp:54446:547"/>
                           <hi>Sancho,</hi> for I have no Courage, nor am I a Knight— And let him take his Squire behind him, if he has one (continu'd the Savage) with this Aſſurance from the valorous <hi>Malambruno,</hi> that no foul Play ſhall be offer'd, nor will he uſe any thing but his Sword to offend him. 'Tis but only turning the Peg before him, and the Horſe will tranſport him through the Air to the Place where <hi>Malambruno</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends their coming. But let them blindfold their Eyes, leſt the dazzling and ſtupendous height of their Career ſhould make 'em giddy; and let the Neighing of the Horſe inform 'em that they are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd to their Journey's end. Thus having made his Speech, the Savage turn'd about with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, and leaving <hi>Clavileno,</hi> march'd out hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely the ſame way they came in.</p>
                        <p>The Diſconſolate Matron ſeeing the Horſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt with Tears addreſs'd Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> Valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Knight, cry'd ſhe, <hi>Malambruno</hi> is a Man of his Word, the Horſe is here, our Beards bud on, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I and every one of us conjure you by all the Hairs on our Chins, to haſten our Deliverance; ſince there needs no more but that you and your Squire get up, and give a happy Beginning to your intended Journey. Madam, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote,</hi> I'll do't with all my Heart, I will not ſo much as ſtay for a Cuſhion, or to put on my Spurs, but mount inſtantly; ſuch is my Impatience to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beard your Ladyſhip's Face, and reſtore ye all your former Gacefulneſs.

Iſlanders ſay, think ye, when they hear their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour is flying like a Paper-Kite? Beſides, 'tis three or four thouſand Leagues from hence to <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daya,</hi> and what if the Horſe ſhou'd tire upon the Road? or the Giant grow humourſome? What wou'd become of us then? We may be ſeven Years a getting home again; and Heaven knows by that Time what would become of my Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Neither Iſland nor Dryland would know poor <hi>Sancho</hi> agen. No, no, I know better things! What ſays the old Proverb? Delays breed Danger; and when a Cow's given thee, run and catch her by the Halter! I am the Gentlewomens humble Servant, but they and their Beards muſt excuſe me Faith! 'tis good ſleeping in a whole Skin; I know when I am well. Here I'm made much of, and by the Maſter of the Houſe's Good Will, I hope to ſee my ſelf a Governour; if I ſtir the King ſhall know it. Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid the Duke, as for your Iſland it neither floats nor ſtirs, ſo there's no fear it ſhou'd run away before you come back; the Foundations of it are fix'd and rooted in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Abyſs of the Earth. Now becauſe you muſt needs think I cannot but know, that there is no kind of Office of any Value, that is not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd with ſome ſort of Bribe or Gratification, of one kind or other, all that I expect for advancing you to this Government, is only that you wait on your Maſter in this Expedition, that there may be an End of this memorable Adventure: And I here engage my Honour, that whether you return on <hi>Clavileno</hi> with all the ſpeed his Swiftneſs promiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And for my own Part, Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior <hi>Sancho,</hi> I'll aſſure you, you'd very much wrong my Friendſhip, ſhou'd you in the leaſt doubt my Readineſs to ſerve you. Good your Worſhip ſay no more, cry'd <hi>Sancho.</hi> I am but a poor Squire, and your Goodneſs is too great a Load for my Shoulders. But hang Baſeneſs; Mount, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and blindfold me, ſome-body; wiſh me a good Voyage, and pray for me— But harkee, good Folks, when I am got up, and fly in the Skies, mayn't I ſay my Prayers, and call on the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels my ſelf to help me, trow? Yes, yes, anſwer'd <hi>Trifaldi;</hi> for <hi>Malumbruno,</hi> though an Inchanter, is nevertheleſs a Chriſtian, and does all things with a great deal of Sagacity, having nothing to do with thoſe he ſhould not meddle with. Come on then, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> let's away, and Heaven proſper us. Thy Fear, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> might by a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Mind be thought ominous: Since the Adventure of the Fulling-Mills, I have not ſeen thee poſſeſs'd with ſuch a panick Terrour. But hark ye, begging this noble Company's Leave, I muſt have a Word with you in private. Then withdrawing into a diſtant Part of the Garden a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſome Trees; My dear <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid he, thou feeſt we are going to take a long Journey; thou art no leſs ſenſible of the Uncertainty of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and Heaven alone can tell what Leiſure or Conveniency we may have in all that Time. Let me therefore beg thee to ſlip aſide to thy Chamber, as if it were to get thy ſelf ready for our Journey, and there preſently diſpatch me only ſome 500 Laſhes on the Account of the 3300 thou ſtandeſt engag'd for; 'twill ſoon be done, and a Buſineſs once begun, you know, is half ended.

Come, come, Sir, let's do one thing after another; let us get off theſe Women's Whiskers, and then I'll feague it away for <hi>Dulcinea.</hi> I have no more to ſay on the Matter at preſent. Well, honeſt <hi>Sancho,</hi> reply'd Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote,</hi> I'll take thy Word for once, and I hope thou'lt make it good; for I believe thou art more Fool than Knave. I am what I am, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> but whatever I be, I'll keep my Word ne'er fear it.</p>
                        <p>Upon this they return'd to the Company; and juſt as they were going to mount, Blind thy Eyes <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and get up. Sure he that ſends ſo far for us can have no Deſign to deceive us, ſince 'twould never be to his Credit to delude thoſe that rely on his Word of Honour; and tho' the Succeſs ſhould not be anſwerable to our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, ſtill the Glory of ſo brave an Attempt will be ours, and 'tis not in the Power of Malice to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe it. To Horſe then, Sir, cry'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> to Horſe: The Tears of thoſe poor bearded Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women have melted my Heart, and methinks I feel their Briſtles ſticking in it. I ſhan't eat a Bit to do me Good, till I ſee them have as pretty dimpled ſmooth Chins and ſoft Lips as they had before. Mount then I ſay, and blindfold your ſelf firſt; for if I muſt ride behind, 'tis a plain Caſe you muſt get up before me. That's right, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> and with that pulling a Handkerchief out of his Pocket, he gave it to the diſconſolate Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron to hoodwink him cloſe. She did ſo; but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after uncovering himſelf, If I remember right, ſaid he, <hi>Virgil</hi> tells us of the <hi>Trojan Palladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> that wooden Horſe which the <hi>Greeks</hi> offer'd <hi>Pallas,</hi> full of arm'd Knights, who afterwards
<pb n="1010" facs="tcp:54446:549"/>
prov'd the total Ruin of that famous City. 'Twere Prudence therefore, before we get up, to probe this Steed, and ſee what he has in his Guts. You need not, ſaid the Counteſs <hi>Trifaldi;</hi> I dare engage there's no Ground for any ſuch Surmiſe; for <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lambruno</hi> is a Man of Honour, and wou'd not ſo much as countenance any baſe or treacherous Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; and whatever Accident befalls ye, I dare an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for. Upon this Don <hi>Quixote</hi> mounted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Reply, imagining that what he might fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther urge concerning his Security, would be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on his Valour. He then began to try the Pin, which was eaſily turn'd; and as he ſate with his long Legs ſtretch'd at Length for want of Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rups, he look'd like one of thoſe antique Figures in a <hi>Roman</hi> Triumph, woven in ſome old Piece of Arras.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sancho</hi> very leiſurely and unwillingly was made to climb up behind him; and fixing himſelf as well as he cou'd on the Crupper, felt it ſomewhat hard and uneaſy. With that, looking on the Duke, Good my Lord, quoth he, will you lend me ſomething to clap under me, ſome Pillow from the Page's Bed, or the Dutcheſs's Cuſhion of State, or any thing; for this Horſe's Crupper is ſo confounded hard, I fancy 'tis rather Marble than Wood. 'Tis needleſs, ſaid the Counteſs, for <hi>Clavileno</hi> will bear no kind of Furniture upon him; ſo that for your greater Eaſe you had beſt ſit ſide-ways like a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. <hi>Sancho</hi> took her Advice; and then after he had taken his Leave of the Company, they bound a Cloth over his Eyes. But preſently after unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering his Face, with a pitiful Look on all the Spectators, Good tender-hearted Chriſtians, (cry'd he, with Tears in his Eyes) beſtow a few <hi>Pater Noſters</hi> and <hi>Ave-Marys</hi> on a poor departing Brother, and pray for my Soul, as you expect the like Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity your ſelves in ſuch a Condition. What! you
<pb n="1011" facs="tcp:54446:549"/>
Raſcal, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> d'ye think your ſelf at the Gallows, and at the Point of Death, that you hold forth in ſuch a lamentable Strain? Daſtardly Wretch without a Soul, doſt thou not know that the fair <hi>Magalona</hi> once ſate in thy Place, and alight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from thence, not into the Grave, thou Chicken-hearted Varlet, but into the Throne of <hi>France,</hi> if there's any Truth in Hiſtory? And do not I ſit by thee, that I may vie with the valorous <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence,</hi> and preſs the Seat that was once preſs'd by him? Come blindfold thy Eyes, poor ſpiritleſs A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal, and let me not know thee betray the leaſt Symptom of Fear, at leaſt not in my Preſence. Well, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> hoodwink me then among ye: But 'tis no Mar'l one ſhould be afraid, when you won't let one ſay his Prayers, nor be pray'd for, though for ought I know we may have a Legion of Imps about our Ears to clap us up in the Devil's Pound preſently.</p>
                        <p>Now both being hoodwink'd, and Don <hi>Quixote</hi> perceiving every thing ready for their ſetting out, began to turn the Pin; and no ſooner had he ſet his Hand to it, but the Waiting-Women and all the Company ſet up their Throats, crying out, Speed you, ſpeed you well, valorous Knight, Heaven be your Guide, undaunted Squire! Now, now, you fly aloft. See how they cut the Air more ſwiftly than an Arrow! Now they mount, and tower, and ſoar, while the gazing World wonders at their Courſe. Sit faſt, ſit faſt, couragious <hi>Sancho;</hi> you don't ſit ſteady, have a Care of falling; for ſhou'd you now drop from that amazing Height, your Fall would be greater than the aſpiring Youth's that miſguided the Chariot of the Sun his Father. All this <hi>Sancho</hi> heard; and girting his Arms faſt about his Maſter's Waſte, Sir, quoth he, why do they ſay we are ſo high, ſince we can hear their Voices?
<pb n="1012" facs="tcp:54446:550"/>
Troth I hear 'em ſo plainly, that one would think they were cloſe by us. Ne'er mind that, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> for in theſe extraordinary kind of Flights, we muſt ſuppoſe our Hearing and Seeing will be extraordinary alſo. But don't hold me ſo hard, for you'll make me tumble off. What makes thee tremble ſo? I'm ſure I never rid eaſier in all my Life; our Horſe goes as if he did not move at all. Come then, take Courage; we make ſwing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Way, and have a fair and merry Gale. I think ſo too, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> for I feel the Wind puff as briskly upon me here, as if I don't know how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Pair of Bellows were blowing Wind in my Tail. <hi>Sancho</hi> was not altogether in the Wrong; for ſome ſtrong Pairs of Bellows were indeed le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd at him then, which gave Air very plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; ſo well had the Plot of this Adventure been laid by the Duke, the Dutcheſs, and their Steward, that nothing was wanting to further the Diverſion.</p>
                        <p>Don <hi>Quixote</hi> at laſt feeling the Wind, Sure, ſaid he, we muſt be riſen to the middle Region of the Air, where the Winds, Hail, Snow, Thunder, Light'ning, and other Meteors are produc'd; ſo that if we mount at this Rate, we ſhall be in the Region of Fire preſently, and what's worſt, I don't know how to manage this Pin, ſo as to avoid being ſcorch'd and roaſted alive. At the ſame Time ſome Flax, with other combuſtible Matter which had been got ready, was clapp'd at the End of a long Stick, and ſet on Fire at a ſmall Diſtance from their Noſes; and the Heat and Smoke affecting the Knight and the Squire, May I be hang'd, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> if we ben't come to this Fire-Place you talk of, or very near it; for the Half of my Beard is ſindg'd already. I have a huge Mind to peep out, and ſee whereabouts we are. By no Means, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> I remember the ſtrange but
<pb n="1013" facs="tcp:54446:550"/>
true Story of Doctor <hi>Torralva,</hi> whom the Devils carry'd to <hi>Rome</hi> hoodwink'd, and beſtriding a Reed, in twelve Hours Time, ſetting him down on the Tower of <hi>Nona,</hi> in one of the Streets of that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. There he ſaw the dreadful Tumult, Aſſault, and Death of the Conſtable of <hi>Bourbon;</hi> and the next Morning he found himſelf at <hi>Madrid,</hi> where he related the whole Story. Among other things, he ſaid, as he went through the Air, the Devil bid him open his Eyes; which he did, and then he found himſelf ſo near the Moon, that he could touch it with his Finger; but durſt not look to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Earth, leſt the Diſtance ſhould make his Brains turn round. So, <hi>Sancho,</hi> we muſt not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veil our Eyes, but rather wholly truſt to the Care and Providence of him that has Charge of us; and fear nothing, for we only mount high to come ſouſe down, like a Hawk, upon the Kingdom of <hi>Candaya,</hi> which we ſhall reach preſently: For tho' it appears not Half an Hour to us ſince we left the Garden, we have nevertheleſs travell'd over a vaſt Tract of Air. I know nothing of the Matter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd <hi>Sancho;</hi> but this I am very certain, that if your Madam <hi>Magullane</hi> or <hi>Magalona</hi> (what d'ye call her) could ſit this damn'd wooden Crupper with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a good Cuſhion under her Tail, ſhe muſt have had a harder Pair of Buttocks than mine.</p>
                        <p>This Dialogue was certainly very Pleaſant all this while to the Duke, the Dutcheſs, and the reſt of the Company; and now at laſt reſolving to put an end to this extraordinary Adventure, which had ſo long entertain'd them ſucceſsfully, they order'd one of their Servants to give fire to <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileno</hi>'s Tail; and the Horſe being ſtuft full of Squibs, Crackers, and other Fire-works, burſt preſently into Pieces, with a might Noiſe, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Knight one way, and the Squire another,
<pb n="1014" facs="tcp:54446:551"/>
both ſufficiently Sindg'd. By this time, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate Matron, and Bearded Regiment were Vaniſh'd out of the Garden, and all the reſt counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting a Trance, lay flat upon the Ground. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> ſorely Bruis'd, made ſhift to get up, and looking about, were amaz'd to find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the ſame Garden whence they took Horſe, and to ſee ſuch a number of People lie Dead, as they thought, on the Ground. But their Wonder was diverted by the appearance of a large Lance ſtuck in the Ground, and a Scroll of white Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment faſten'd to it by two green ſilken Strings, with the following Inſcription upon it in Golden Characters.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Renown'd Knight, Don</hi> Quixote de la Mancha, <hi>atchiev'd the Adventure of the Counteſs</hi> Trifaldi, <hi>other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe call'd the</hi> Diſconſolate Matron, <hi>and her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions in Diſtreſs, by barely attempting it.</hi> Malam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruno <hi>is fully ſatisfy'd. The Waiting-Gentlewomen have loſt their Beards: King</hi> Clavijo, <hi>and Queen</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonomaſia <hi>have reſum'd their priſtine Shapes; and when the Squire's Penance ſhall be finiſh'd, the White Dove ſhall ſcape the Pounces of the Pernicious Hawks that purſue her, and her Pining Lover ſhall lull her in his Arms. This is preordain'd by the Sage</hi> Merlin <hi>Proto-Inchanter of Inchanters.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Don <hi>Quixote</hi> having read this Oracle, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruing it to refer to <hi>Dulcinea</hi>'s Diſ-inchantment, render'd Thanks to Heaven for ſo great a Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and approaching the Duke and Dutcheſs, who ſeem'd as yet in a Swoon, he took the Duke by the Hand: Courage, Courage, Noble Sir, cry'd he, there's no Danger; the Adventure is finiſh'd without Blood-ſhed, as you may read it Regiſtr'd in that Record.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="1015" facs="tcp:54446:551"/>The Duke, Yawning and Stretching, as if he had been wak'd out of a ſound Sleep, recover'd himſelf by degrees, as did the Dutcheſs and the reſt of the Company; all of'em acting the Surprize ſo naturally, that the Jeſt could not be diſcover'd. The Duke rubbing his Eyes, made a ſhift to read the Scroll, then Embracing Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll'd his Valour to the Skies, aſſuring him, he was the braveſt Knight the Earth had ever Poſſeſs'd: As for <hi>Sancho,</hi> he was looking up and down the Garden for the Diſconſolate Matron, to ſee what ſort of a Face ſhe had got, now her Firz-buſh was off. But he was inform'd, that, as <hi>Clavileno</hi> came down Flaming in the Air, the Counteſs, with her Women, Vaniſh'd immediately, but not one of 'em Chinbriſtl'd, nor ſo much as a Hair upon their Faces.</p>
                        <p>Then the Dutcheſs ask'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> how he had far'd in his long Voyage? Why truly Madam, anſwer'd he, I have ſeen Wonders; for you muſt know, that, though my Maſter would not ſuffer me to pull the Cloath from my Eyes, yet as I have a kind of an Itch to know every thing, and a Spice of the Spirit of Contradiction, ſtill hankering after what's forbidden me; ſo when, as my Maſter told me, we were Flying through the Legion of Fire, I ſhov'd my Handkerchief a little above my Noſe, and look'd down; and what d'you think I ſaw? I ſpy'd the Earth a hugeous way a far off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me (Heaven bleſs us!) no bigger than a Muſtard-ſeed; and the Men walking to and fro upon't, not much larger than Hazle-Nuts. Judge now if we were not got up wounded high! Have a Care what you ſay, my Friend, ſaid the Dutcheſs; for if the Men were bigger than Hazle-Nuts, and the Earth no bigger than a Muſtard-ſeed, one Man muſt be bigger than the whole Earth, and
<pb n="1016" facs="tcp:54446:552"/>
cover it ſo that you cou'd not ſee it. Like enough, anſwer'd <hi>Sancho;</hi> but for all that, d'you ſee, I ſaw it with a kind of a ſide-Look upon one Part of it, or ſo. Look you, <hi>Sancho,</hi> reply'd the Dutcheſs, that won't bear; for no Thing can be wholly ſeen by any Part of it. Well, well, Madam, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I don't underſtand your Parts and Wholes! I ſaw it, and there's an end of the Story. Only you muſt think that as we flew by Inchantment, ſo we ſaw by Inchantment, and thus I might ſee the Earth, and all the Men, which way ſoever I look'd: I'll warrant, you won't believe me neither when I tell you, that when I thruſt up the Kerchief above my Brows, I ſaw my ſelf ſo near Heaven, that between the top of my Cap. and the main Sky, there was not a Span and a half. And Heaven bleſs us, forſooth, what a hugeous great Place it is! And we happen'd to Travel that Road where the<note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>Pleiades,</hi> vulgarly call'd in <hi>Spaniſh</hi> the Seven young She-Goats.</note> ſeven She-Goat-Stars were: And Faith and Troth, I had ſuch a Mind to Play with 'em (having been once a Goat-herd my ſelf) that I fancy I'd have cry'd my ſelf to Death had I not done it. So ſoon as I ſpy'd 'em, what does me I, but ſneaks down very ſoberly from behind my Maſter, without telling any living Soul, and play'd, and leap'd about for three quarters of an Hour by the Clock, with the pretty Nanny-Goats, who are as ſweet and fine as ſo many Marigolds or Gilly-Flowers. And honeſt <hi>Wooden Peg</hi> ſtirr'd not one Step all the while. And while <hi>Sancho</hi> employ'd himſelf with the Goats, ask'd the Duke, how was Don <hi>Quixote</hi> employ'd? Truly, anſwer'd the Knight, I am ſenſible all
<pb n="1017" facs="tcp:54446:552"/>
things were alter'd from their Natural Courſe, therefore what <hi>Sancho</hi> ſays ſeems the leſs ſtrange to me. But for my own part, I neither ſaw Heaven nor Hell, Sea nor Shore. I perceiv'd indeed we paſs'd through the middle Region of the Air, and were pretty near that of Fire, but that we came ſo near Heaven, as <hi>Sancho</hi> ſays, is altogether incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; becauſe we then muſt have paſs'd quite through the Fiery Region, which lies between the Sphere of the Moon and the upper Region of the Air. Now it was impoſſible for us to reach that part, where are the <hi>Pleiades,</hi> or the <hi>Seven Goats,</hi> as <hi>Sancho</hi> calls 'em, without being Conſum'd in the Elemental Fire, and therefore ſince we eſcap'd thoſe Flames, certainly we did not ſoar ſo high, and <hi>Sancho</hi> either Lies or Dreams. I neither Lie nor Dream, reply'd <hi>Sancho.</hi> Uds Precious! I can tell you the Marks and Colour of every Goat among 'em, if you don't believe me. Do but ask and try me: You'll eaſily ſee whether I ſpeak Truth or no. Well, ſaid the Dutcheſs, prithee tell us, good <hi>Sancho.</hi> Look you, anſwer'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> there were two of 'em Green, two Carnation, two Blue, and one party-colour'd. Truly, ſaid the Duke, that's a new kind of Goats you have found out, <hi>Sancho,</hi> we have none of thoſe Colours upon Earth. Sure, Sir, reply'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> you'll make ſome ſhort difference between Heavenly She-Goats, and the Goats of this World? But, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid the Duke, among thoſe She-Goats did you ſee never a He? Not one Horn'd Beaſt of the Maſculine Gender? Not one, Sir; I ſaw no other Horn'd thing but the Moon; and I have been told, that neither He-Goats, nor any other Cornuted Tups are ſuffer'd to lift their Horns beyond thoſe of the Moon.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="1018" facs="tcp:54446:553"/>They did not think fit to ask <hi>Sancho</hi> any more Queſtions about his Airy Voyage, for, in the Humour he was in, they judg'd he would not ſtick to ramble all over the Heavens, and tell 'em News of whatever was doing there, though he had not ſtirr'd out of the Garden all the while.</p>
                        <p>Thus ended, in ſhort, the Adventure of the Diſconſolate Matron, which afforded ſufficient Sport to the Duke and Dutcheſs, not only for the preſent, but for the reſt of their Lives; and might have ſupply'd <hi>Sancho</hi> with matter of Talk from Generation to Generation, for many Ages, could he have liv'd ſo long. <hi>Sancho</hi> (ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> whiſpering him in the Ear) ſince you'll have us believe what you have ſeen in Heaven, I deſire you to believe me in what I ſaid I ſaw in <hi>Monteſino</hi>'s Cave. Not a Word more.</p>

Servants and Vaſſals how to behave themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Sancho,</hi> in his Government; the Day after the Scene of the Wooden Horſe, the Duke bid <hi>Sancho</hi> prepare, and be in a readineſs to take Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of his Government; for now his Iſlanders wiſh'd as heartily for him, as they did for Rain in a dry Summer. <hi>Sancho</hi> made an humble Bow, and looking demurely on the Duke; Sir, quoth he, ſince I came down from Heaven, whence I ſaw the Earth ſo very ſmall, I a'n't half ſo hot as I was for being a Governour. For what Greatneſs can there be in being at the Head of a puny Dominion, that's but a little Nook of a tiny Muſtard-ſeed? And what Dignity and Power can a Man be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckon'd to have, in governing half a dozen Men no bigger than Hazle-Nuts? For I cou'd not think there were any more in the whole World. No, if your Grace would throw away upon me never ſo little a Corner in Heaven, though it were but half a League, or ſo, I would take it with better Will than I would the largeſt Iſland on Earth. Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> anſwer'd the Duke, I can't diſpoſe of an Inch of Heaven; for that's the Province of God alone; but what I am able to beſtow, I give you; that is, an Iſland tight and clever, round and well proportion'd, fertile and plentiful to ſuch a Degree, that, if you have but the Art and Underſtanding to manage things right, you may make a Hoard there both of the Treaſure of this World, and the next.</p>
                        <p>Well then, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> let me have this Iſland, and I'll do my beſt to be ſuch a Governour, that in ſpight of Rogues I ſhan't want a ſmall Nook in Heaven one Day or other. 'Tis not out of Covetouſneſs neither that I'd leave my little Cott, and ſet up for ſome body, but meerly to know what kind of thing it is to be a Governour.
<pb n="1020" facs="tcp:54446:554"/>
Oh! <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid the Duke, when once youv'e had a Taſte of it, you'll never leave licking your Fingers, 'tis ſo ſweet and bewitching a thing to Command and be Obey'd. I am confident, when your Maſter comes to be an Emperour (as he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail to be, according to the courſe of his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs) he will never by any Conſiderations be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to an Abdication; his only Grief will be, that he was one no ſooner.</p>
                        <p>Troth Sir, reply'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> I am of your Mind; 'tis a dainty thing to Command, tho' 'twere but a Flock of Sheep. Oh! <hi>Sancho,</hi> cry'd the Duke, let me live and die with thee; for thou haſt an Inſight into every thing. I hope thou'lt prove as good a Governour as thy Wiſdom beſpeaks thee. But no more at this time,—to Morrow without further Delay you ſet forward to your Iſland, and ſhall be furniſh'd this Afternoon with Equipage and Dreſs anſwerable to your Poſt, and all other Neceſſaries for your Journey.</p>
                        <p>Let 'em Dreſs me as they will, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> I ſhall be the ſame <hi>Sancho Pança</hi> ſtill. That's true, ſaid the Duke, yet every Man ought to wear Cloaths ſuitable to his Place and Dignity; for a Lawyer ſhould not go Dreſs'd like a Soldier, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> a Soldier like a Prieſt. As for you, <hi>Sancho,</hi> you are to wear the Habit both of a Captain and a Civil Magiſtrate; ſo your Dreſs ſhall be a Compound of thoſe two; for in the Government, that I beſtow on you, Arms are as neceſſary as Learning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a Man of Letters as requiſite as a Swords-man —Nay, as for Letters, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I can't ſay much for my ſelf; for as yet I ſcarce know my A, B, C; but yet if I can but remember my <hi>Chriſt's-Croſs,</hi> 'tis enough to make me a good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour: As for my Arms, I'll not quit my Weapon as long as I can ſtand, and ſo Heaven be

                        <p>By this time Don <hi>Quixote</hi> arriv'd, and hearing how ſuddenly <hi>Sancho</hi> was to go to his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with the Duke's Permiſſion, he took him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide to give him ſome good Inſtructions for his Conduct in the diſcharge of his Office.</p>
                        <p>Being enter'd Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Chamber, and the Door ſhut, he almoſt forcibly oblig'd <hi>Sancho</hi> to ſit by him, and then with a grave deliberate Voice he thus began.</p>
                        <p>I give Heaven Infinite Thanks, Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> that before I have the happineſs of being put in Poſſeſſion of my Hopes, I can ſee thine already Crown'd. Fortune haſt'ning to meet thee with thy Wiſhes. I, who had aſſign'd the Reward of thy Services upon my happy Succeſs, am yet but on the way to Preferment; and thou, beyond all reaſonable Expectation, art arriv'd at the Aim and End of thy Deſires. Some are aſſiduous, ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous, importunate, riſe early, bribe, entreat, preſs, will take no Denial, obſtinately perſiſt in their Suit, and yet at laſt never obtain it. Another comes on, and by a lucky hit or chance, bears away the Prize, and jumps into the Preferment which ſo many had purſu'd in vain; which verifies the ſaying, <hi>The Happy have their Days, and thoſe they chuſe; Th' Unhappy have but Hours, and thoſe they loſe.</hi> Thou, who ſeem'ſt to me a very Blockhead, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſitting up late, or riſing early, or any manner of Fatigue or Trouble, only the Air of Knight-Errantry being breath'd on thee, art advanc'd to the Government of an Iſland in a Trice, as if it were a thing of no Moment, a very Trifle. I ſpeak this, my dear <hi>Sancho,</hi> not to upbraid thee, nor out of Envy, but only to let thee know, thou art not to attribute all this Succeſs to thy own
<pb n="1022" facs="tcp:54446:555"/>
Merit, while 'tis entirely owing to the kind Heavenly Diſpoſer of Humane Affairs, to whom thy Thanks ought to be return'd. But next to Heaven, thou art to aſcribe thy Happineſs to the Greatneſs of the Profeſſion of Knight-Errantry, which includes within it ſelf ſuch ſtores of Honour and Preferment.</p>
                        <p>Being convinc'd of what I have already ſaid, be yet attentive, O my Son, to what I, thy <hi>Cato,</hi> have further to ſay: Liſten, I ſay, to my Admonitions, and I will be thy North-Star, and Pilot to Steer and bring thee ſafely into the Port of Honour, out of the Tempeſtuous Ocean, into which thou art juſt going to Launch; for Offices and great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments are no better than profound Gulphs of Confuſion.</p>
                        <p>Firſt of all, O my Son, fear God, for the fear of God is the beginning of Wiſdom, and Wiſdom will never let thee go aſtray.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Conſider what thou wert, and make it thy Buſineſs to know thy ſelf, which is the moſt difficult Leſſon in the World. Yet from this Leſſon thou wilt learn to avoid the Frog's fooliſh Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of Swelling to rival the Bigneſs of the Ox; elſe thou wilt ſoon roll down the Wheel of thy mad Preſumption, and be put in Mind that thou wert but a Hog-driver.</p>
                        <p>True, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but I was then but a little Body; for when I grew up to be ſomewhat big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, I drove Geeſe, and not Hogs. But methinks that's nothing to the Purpoſe; for all Governours can't come from Kings and Princes.</p>
                        <p>Very true, purſu'd Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> therefore thoſe who want a noble Deſcent, muſt allay the Severity of their Office with Mildneſs and Civility, which, directed by Wiſdom, may ſecure 'em from the
<pb n="1023" facs="tcp:54446:555"/>
Murmurs and Malice, from which no State nor Condition is exempt.</p>
                        <p>Be well pleas'd with the Meanneſs of thy Family, <hi>Sancho;</hi> nor think it a Diſgrace to own thy ſelf deriv'd from Labouring Men; for, if thou art not aſham'd of it thy ſelf, no body elſe will ſtrive to make thee ſo. Endeavour rather to be eſteem'd Humble and Vertuous, than Proud and Vicious. The number is almoſt Infinite, of thoſe who from low and vulgar Births, have been rais'd to the higheſt Dignities, to the Papal Chair, and the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Throne; and this I could prove by Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples enough to tire thy Patience.</p>
                        <p>Make Vertue the Medium of all thy Actions, and thou wilt have no Cauſe to envy thoſe whoſe Birth gives 'em the Titles of Great Men, and Princes; for Nobility is inherited, but Vertue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd. And Vertue is worth more in it ſelf than Nobleneſs of Birth.</p>
                        <p>If any of thy poor Relations come to ſee thee, never reject nor affront 'em; but on the contrary, receive and entertain 'em with marks of Favour; in this thou wilt diſplay a Generoſity of Nature, and pleaſe Heaven, that would have no body deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe what it has made.</p>
                        <p>If thou ſend'ſt for thy Wife, as 'tis not ſit a Man in thy Station ſhould be long without his Wife, and ſhe ought to partake of her Husband's good Fortune, teach her, inſtruct her, poliſh her the beſt thou can'ſt, till her Native Ruſticity is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to a handſomer Behaviour: For often an ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred Wife throws down all that a good and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Husband can build up:</p>
                        <p>Shoud'ſt thou come to be a Widower, (which is not impoſſible) and thy Poſt recommend thee to a Bride of a higher degree, take not one that ſhall, like a Fiſhing-Rod, only ſerve to catch Bribes.
<pb n="1024" facs="tcp:54446:556"/>
For, take it from me, the Judge muſt at the general and laſt Court of Judicature give a ſtrict account of the diſcharge of his Duty, and muſt pay ſeverely at his dying Day for what he has ſuffer'd his Wife to take.</p>
                        <p>Let never obſtinate Self-conceit be thy Guide; 'tis the Vice of the Ignorant, who vainly preſume on their Underſtanding.</p>
                        <p>Let the Tears of the Poor find more Compaſſion, though not more Juſtice, than the Informations of the Rich.</p>
                        <p>Be equally ſollicitous to find out the Truth, where the Offers and Preſents of the Rich, and the Sobs and Importunities of the Poor, are in the Way.</p>
                        <p>Where-ever Equity ſhould, or may take Place, let not the Extent and Rigour of the Law bear too much on the Delinquent; for 'tis not a better Character in a Judge to be Rigorous, than to be Indulgent.</p>
                        <p>When the Severity of the Law is to be ſoftned, let Pity, not Bribes, be the Motive.</p>
                        <p>If thy Enemy has a Cauſe before thee, turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way thy Eyes from thy Prejudice, and fix them on the matter of Fact.</p>
                        <p>In another Man's Cauſe, be not blinded by thy own Paſſions, for thoſe Errors are almoſt without Remedy, or their Cure will prove Expenſive to thy Wealth and Reputation.</p>
                        <p>When a Beautiful Woman comes before thee, turn away thy Eyes from her Tears, and thy Ears from her Lamentations; and take time to conſider ſedately her Petition, if thou would'ſt not have thy Reaſon and Honeſty loſt in her Sighs and Tears.</p>
                        <p>Revile not with Words thoſe whom their Crimes oblige thee to Puniſh in Deed; for the Puniſhment
<pb n="1025" facs="tcp:54446:556"/>
is enough to the Wretches, without the Addition of Ill Language.</p>
                        <p>In the Tryal of Criminals, conſider, as much as thou can'ſt without Prejudice to the Plaintiff, how defenceleſs and open the Miſerable are to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations of our corrupt and deprav'd Nature; and ſo far ſhew thy ſelf full of Pity and Clemency; for tho' God's Attributes are equal, yet his Mercy is more attractive and pleaſing in our Eyes, than his Juſtice.</p>
                        <p>If thou obſerv'ſt theſe Rules, <hi>Sancho,</hi> thy Days ſhall be long, thy Fame eternal, thy Recompence full, and thy Felicity unſpeakable. Thou ſhalt marry thy Children and Grand-Children to thy Heart's Deſire; they ſhall want no Titles: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd of all Men, thy Life ſhall be peaceable, thy Death in a good and venerable old Age, and the Off ſpring of thy Grand-Children, with their ſoft Youthful Hands, ſhall cloſe thy Eyes.</p>
                        <p>The Precepts I have hitherto given thee, regard the good and ornament of thy Mind. Now give Attention to thoſe Directions that relate to the adorning of thy Body.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>WHO would not have taken Don <hi>Quixote</hi> for a Man of extraordinary Wiſdom and as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Morals, having heard him documentize his Squire in this manner; only as we have often
<pb n="1026" facs="tcp:54446:557"/>
obſerv'd in this Hiſtory, the leaſt talk of Knight-Errantry ſpoil'd all, and made his Underſtanding Muddy: But in every thing elſe, his Judgment was very clear, and his Apprehenſion very nice, ſo that every moment his Actions us'd to diſcredit his Judgment, and his Judgment his Actions. But in theſe Oeconomical Precepts which he gave <hi>Sancho,</hi> he ſhew'd himſelf Maſter of a pleaſant Fancy, and mingl'd his Judgment and Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance in equal proportions. <hi>Sancho</hi> lent him a great deal of Attention, in hopes to Regiſter all thoſe good Counſels in his Mind, and put them in practice; not doubting but by their means he ſhould acquit himſelf of his Duty like a Man of Honour.</p>
                        <p>As to the Government of thy Perſon and Family (purſu'd Don <hi>Quixote</hi>) my firſt Injunction is Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. Pare thy Nails, nor let 'em grow as ſome do, whoſe Folly perſwades them that long Nails add to the beauty of the Hand; till they look more like <hi>Caſtril</hi>'s Claws than a Man's Nails. 'Tis foul and unſightly.</p>
                        <p>Keep thy Cloaths tight about thee; for a ſloven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Looſeneſs is an Argument of a careleſs Mind; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſuch a Negligence, like that of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> be affected for ſome cunning Deſign.</p>
                        <p>Prudently examine what thy Income may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to in a Year. And if ſufficient to afford thy Servants Liveries, let 'em be decent and laſting, rather than gaudy and for Show; and for the over-plus of thy good Husbandry, beſtow it on the Poor. That is, if thou canſt keep ſix Footmen, have but three; and let what would maintain three more, be laid out in Charitable Uſes. By that Means thou wilt have Attendants in Heaven as well as on Earth, which our vain-glorious great
<pb n="1027" facs="tcp:54446:557"/>
ones, who are Strangers to this Practice, are not like to have.</p>
                        <p>Leſt thy Breath betray thy Peaſantry, defile it not with Onions and Garlick.</p>
                        <p>Walk with Gravity, and ſpeak with Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and yet not as if thou didſt hearken to thy own Words; for all Affectation is a Fault.</p>
                        <p>Eat little at Dinner, and leſs at Supper; for the Stomach is the Store-houſe, whence Health is to be imparted to the whole Body.</p>
                        <p>Drink moderately; for Drunkenneſs neither keeps a Secret, nor obſerves a Promiſe.</p>
                        <p>Be careful not to chew on both ſides, that is, fill not thy Mouth too full, and take heed not to eruct before Company.</p>
                        <p>Eruct, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I don't underſtand that cramp Word. To eruct, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> is as much as to ſay <hi>to Belch;</hi> but this being one of the moſt diſagreeable and beaſtly Words in our Language, though very expreſſive and ſignificant, the more Polite, inſtead of <hi>Belching,</hi> ſay <hi>Eructing,</hi> which is borrow'd from the <hi>Latin.</hi> Now though the Vulgar may not underſtand this, it matters not much; for Uſe and Cuſtom will make it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar and underſtood. By ſuch Innovations are Languages enrich'd, when the Words are adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Multitude, and Naturaliz'd by Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.</p>
                        <p>Faith and Troth, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> of all your Counſels, I'll be ſure not to forget this, for I've been mightily given to <hi>Belching.</hi> Say Eructing, reply'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and leave off Belching. Well, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> be it as you ſay, Eruct; I'll be ſure to remember.</p>
                        <p>In the next place, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid the Knight, do not overlard your common Diſcourſe with that glut of Proverbs, which you mix in it continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
<pb n="1028" facs="tcp:54446:558"/>
for though Proverbs are properly conciſe and pithy Sentences, yet as thou bring'ſt 'em in, in ſuch a huddle, by the Head and Shoulders, thou makeſt 'em look like ſo many Abſurdities. Alas! Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> this is a Diſeaſe that Heaven alone can cure; for I've more Proverbs than will fill a Book, and when I talk, they crowd ſo thick and faſt to my Mouth, that they quarrel which ſhall get out firſt; ſo that my Tongue is forc'd to let 'em out as faſt, firſt come firſt ſerv'd, though nothing to my purpoſe. But henceforwards I'll ſet a Watch on my Mouth, and let none fly out, but ſuch as ſhall befit the Gravity of my Place. For in a rich Man's Houſe the Cloath is ſoon laid; where there's Plenty the Gueſts can't be empty. A Blot's no Blot till 'tis hit. He's ſafe who ſtands under the Bells; you can't eat Cake and have your Cake; and Store's no Sore.</p>
                        <p>Go on, go on, Friend, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> thread, tack, ſtitch on, heap Proverb on Proverb, out with 'em Man, ſpew 'em out! There's no Body coming. My Mother whips me, and I whip the Gigg. I warn thee to forbear foiſting in a Rope of Proverbs every where, and thou blunder'ſt out a whole Litany of old Saws, as much to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe as <hi>the laſt Year's Snow.</hi> Obſerve me, <hi>Sancho,</hi> I condemn not the uſe of Proverbs: But 'tis moſt certain, that ſuch a Confuſion and Hodge-podge of 'em as thou throw'ſt out and dragg'ſt in by the Hair together, make Converſation fulſome and poor.</p>
                        <p>When thou do'ſt ride, caſt not thy Body all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap> the Crupper, nor hold thy Leggs ſtiff down, and ſtradling from the Horſe's Belly; nor yet ſo looſe as if thou wert ſtill on <hi>Dapple;</hi> for the Air and Gracefulneſs of ſitting a Horſe, diſtinguiſhes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Gentleman from a Groom. Sleep with
<pb n="1029" facs="tcp:54446:558"/>
Moderation; for he that riſes not with the Sun, loſes ſo much Day. And remember this, <hi>Sancho,</hi> that Diligence is the Mother of good Fortune. Sloth, on the contrary, never effected any thing that ſprung from a good and reaſonable Deſire.</p>
                        <p>The Advice which I ſhall conclude with, I would have thee be ſure to fix in thy Memory, though it relate not to the Adorning thy Perſon; for I am perſwaded, it will redound as much to thy Advantage as any I have yet given thee: And this it is.</p>
                        <p>Never undertake to diſpute, or decide any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, concerning the Preheminence of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; ſince in the Compariſon one muſt be better than the other; for he that is leſſen'd by thee will hate thee, and the other whom thou preferreſt will not think himſelf oblig'd to thee.</p>
                        <p>As for thy Dreſs, wear cloſe Breeches and Hoſe, a long Waſte-coat, and a Cloak a little longer. I don't adviſe thee to wear wide-knee'd Breeches or Trunk Hoſe; for they become neither Swords-men nor Men of Buſineſs.</p>
                        <p>This is all the Advice, Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> I have to give thee at preſent. If thou takeſt care to let me hear from thee hereafter, I ſhall give thee more, according as the Occaſions and Emergencies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
                        <p>Sir, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> I ſee very well that all you've told me is mighty good, wholſom, and to the purpoſe: But what am I the better, if I cannot keep it in my Head? I grant you, I ſhan't eaſily forget that about paring my Nails, and Marrying again, if I ſhould have the luck to bury my Wife. But for all that other Callimaufry, and heap of Stuff, I can no more remember one ſyllable of it, than the ſhapes of laſt Year's Clouds. Therefore let me have it in Black and White, I beſeech you.
<pb n="1030" facs="tcp:54446:559"/>
'Tis true I can neither write nor read, but I'll give it to my Father Confeſſor, that he may beat and hammer it into my Noddle, as occaſion ſerves. O Heaven, cry'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> how Infamouſly it looks in a Governour not to be able to write or read! I muſt needs tell thee <hi>Sancho,</hi> that for a Man to be ſo Illiterate, or to be Left-handed, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that either his Parents were very poor and mean, or that he was of ſo perverſe a Nature, he could not receive the Impreſſions of Learning or any thing that is good. Poor Soul, I pity thee! That is indeed a very great Defect. I would have thee at leaſt learn to write thy Name. Oh! as for that quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I can do well enough. I can ſet my Name; for when I ſerv'd Offices in our Pariſh, I learn'd to ſcrawl a ſort of Letters, ſuch as they mark Bundles of Stuff with, which they told me ſpelt my Name. Beſides, I can pretend my right Hand is lame, and ſo another ſhall ſign for me; for there's a Remedy for all things but Death. And ſince I've the Power, I'll do what I liſt; for as the ſaying is, he whoſe Father is his Judge, may do what he will. And as I am a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, I hope I am ſomewhat higher than a Judge. New Lords new Laws. Ay, ay, let them come as they will and play at Bo-peep. Let 'em back-bite me to my Face, I'll bite-back the Biters. Let 'em come for Wooll, and I'll ſend 'em home ſhorn. Whom God loves, his Houſe happy proves. The rich Man's Follies paſs for wiſe Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in this World. So I being Rich, d'you ſee, and a Governour, and free-hearted too into the Bargain, as I intend to be, I ſhall have no Faults at all. 'Tis ſo, daub your ſelf with Honey, and you'll never want Flies. What a Man has, ſo much he's ſure of, ſaid my old Grannam; and who ſhall hang the Bell about the Cat's Neck?</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="1031" facs="tcp:54446:559"/>Confound thee, cry'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> for an eternal Proverb-voiding Swag-belly. Threeſcore thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Belzebubs</hi> take thee, and thy damn'd nauſeous Rubbiſh. Thou haſt been this Hour hanging them together, like ſo many Ropes of Onions, and poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning and racking me with 'em. I dare ſay theſe wicked Proverbs will one Day bring thee to the Gallows, they'll provoke thy Iſlanders to pull thee down, or at leaſt make 'em ſhun thee like a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Nuſance. Tell me, thou Eſſence of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, where doſt thou rake 'em up? And how does thy Cods-head apply 'em? For it makes me ſweat, as if I were delving or threſhing, to ſpeak but one and apply it properly.</p>
                        <p>Udſprecious! My good Maſter, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> what a ſmall Matter puts you in a pelting Chafe! Why the Devil ſhould you grudge me the uſe of my own Goods and Chattels? I have no other Eſtate. Proverbs on Proverbs are all my Stock. And now I have four ready to pop out, as pat to the purpoſe as Matrimony to a young Widow. But Mum for that. Now Silence is my Name. No, reply'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> rather Prate-roaſt and Sauce-box we ſhould call thee; for thou art all Tittle-tattle and Obſtinacy. Yet methinks I'd fain hear theſe four notable Proverbs that come ſo pat to the purpoſe. I thank Heaven I have a pretty good Memory, and yet I can't for my Soul call one to mind. Why Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> what Proverbs would you have better than theſe? Between two Cheek-Teeth never clap thy Thumbs. And when a Man ſays get out of my Houſe, what would you with my Wife? There's no anſwer to be made. And again, whether the Pitcher hit the Stone, or the Stone the Pitcher, it's bad for the Pitcher. All theſe fit to a hair, Sir. That is, let no body med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with his Governour, or his Betters, or he'll rue
<pb n="1032" facs="tcp:54446:560"/>
for it, as ſure as a Gun; as he muſt expect who runs his Finger between two Cheek-Teeth, (and tho' they were not Cheek-teeth, if they be but Teeth that's enough) In the next place, let the Governor ſay what he will, there's no gainſaying him; 'tis as much as when one ſays, get out of my Houſe, what would you with my Wife? And as for the Stone and the Pitcher, a Blind Man may ſee through it. And ſo he that ſees a Mote in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man's Eye, ſhould do well to take the Beam out of his own; that People mayn't ſay, the Pot calls the Kettle black-arſe, and the dead Woman's afraid of her that's flea'd. Beſides, your Worſhip knows, that a Fool knows more in his own Houſe than a wiſe Body in another Man's. That's a Miſtake, <hi>Sancho,</hi> reply'd Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> for the Fool knows nothing, neither in his own Houſe nor in another Man's; for no ſubſtantial Knowledge can be erected on ſo bad a Foundation as Folly. But let's break off this Diſcourſe; if thou do'ſt not diſcharge the part of a good Governor, thine will be the Fault, though the ſhame and diſcredit will be mine. However, this is my Comfort, I've done my Duty in giving thee the beſt and moſt wholſom Advice I could: And ſo Heaven proſper and direct thee in thy Government, and diſappoint my Fears of thy turning all things upſide down in that poor Iſland; which I might indeed prevent by giving the Duke a more perfect Inſight into thee, and diſcovering to him, that all that gorbel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly'd paunch-gutted little Corps of thine, is nothing but a Bundle of Proverbs and a Sack full of Kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
                        <p>Look you Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> if you think me not fit for this Government, I'll think no more on't. Alas! the leaſt Snip of my Soul's Nails (as a Body may ſay) is dearer to me than my whole Body:
<pb n="1033" facs="tcp:54446:560"/>
And I hope I can live plain <hi>Sancho</hi> ſtill, upon a Luncheon of Bread and a Clove of Garlick, as contented as Governour <hi>Sancho</hi> upon Capons and Partridges. Death and Sleep make us all alike, Rich and Poor, High and Low. Do but call to Mind who firſt put this Whim of Government in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Noddle, you'll find 'twas your own ſelf; for as for me, I know no more what belongs to Iſlands and Governours than a blind Buzzard.</p>
                        <p>So if you fancy the Devil will have me for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Governour, let me be plain <hi>Sancho</hi> ſtill, and go to Heaven, rather than my Lord Governour, and go to Hell.</p>
                        <p>Theſe laſt Words of thine, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> in my Opinion, prove thee worthy to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern a thouſand Iſlands. Thou haſt naturally a good Diſpoſition, without which all Knowledge is inſufficient. Recommend thy ſelf to the Divine Providence, and be ſure never to depart from Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs of Intention; I mean, have ſtill a firm Purpoſe and Deſign to be thoroughly inform'd in all the Buſineſs that ſhall come before thee, and act upon ſure Grounds, for Heaven always favours good Deſires: And ſo let's go to Dinner, for I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve now the Duke and Dutcheſs expect us.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XLIV.</hi> How <hi>Sancho Pança</hi> was carried to his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and of the ſtrange Adventure that befel Don <hi>Quixote</hi> in the Caſtle.</head>
                        <p>WE have it from the traditional Account of this Hiſtory, that there is a manifeſt Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Tranſlation and the <hi>Arabick</hi> in the Beginning of this Chapter; <hi>Cid Hamet</hi> having in the Original taken an Occaſion of criticizing on himſelf for undertaking ſo dry and limited a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which muſt confine him to the bare Hiſtory of Don <hi>Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho,</hi> and debar him the Liberty of launching into Epiſodes and Digreſſions that might be of more Weight and Entertainment. To have his Fancy, his Hand, and Pen bound up to a ſingle Deſign, and his Sentiments confin'd to the Mouths of ſo few Perſons, he urg'd as an inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable Toil, and of ſmall Credit to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker; ſo that, to avoid this Inconveniency, he has introduc'd into the firſt Part ſome Novels, as <hi>The Curious Impertinent,</hi> and that of the <hi>Captive,</hi> which were in a Manner diſtinct from the Deſign, tho' the reſt of the Stories which he brought in there fall naturally enough in with Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Affairs, and ſeem of Neceſſity to claim a Place in the Work. It was his Opinion likewiſe, as he has told us, that the Adventures of Don <hi>Quixote</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring ſo great a Share of the Reader's Attention, his Novels muſt expect but an indifferent Recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="1035" facs="tcp:54446:561"/>
or, at moſt, but a curſory View, not ſufficient to diſcover their artificial Contexture, which muſt have been very obvious had they been publiſh'd by themſelves, without the Interludes of Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Madneſs or <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Impertinence. He has there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this ſecond Part avoided all diſtinct and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Stories, introducing only ſuch as have the Appearance of Epiſodes, yet flow naturally from the Deſign of the Story; and theſe but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and with as much Brevity as they can be expreſs'd. Therefore ſince he has ty'd himſelf up to ſuch narrow Bounds, and confin'd his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Parts, otherwiſe capable of the moſt copious Subjects, to the pure Matter of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Undertaking, he begs it may add a Value to his Work; and that he may be commended, not ſo much for what he has writ, as for what he has forborn to write. And then he proceeds in his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory as follows.</p>
                        <p>After Dinner Don <hi>Quixote</hi> gave <hi>Sancho</hi> in Writing the Copy of his verbal Inſtructions, ordering him to get ſome Body to read 'em to him. But the Squire had no ſooner got 'em; but he dropt the Paper, which fell into the Duke's Hands; who communicating the ſame to the Dutcheſs, they found a freſh Occaſion of admiring the Mixture of Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s good Senſe and Extravagance: And ſo carrying on the Humour, they ſent <hi>Sancho</hi> that Afternoon with a ſuitable Equipage to the Place he was to govern, which, where-ever it lay, was to be an Iſland to him.</p>
                        <p>It happen'd that the Management of this Affair was committed to a Steward of the Duke's, a Man of a facetious Humour, and who had not only Wit to ſtart a pleaſant Deſign, but Diſcretion to carry it on; two Qualifications which make an agreeable Conſort when they meet; nothing being truly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
<pb n="1036" facs="tcp:54446:562"/>
without good Senſe. He had already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonated the Counteſs <hi>Trifaldi</hi> very ſucceſsfully, and, with his Maſter's Inſtructions in relation to his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour towards <hi>Sancho,</hi> could not but diſcharge his Truſt to a Wonder. Now it fell out, that <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> no ſooner caſt his Eyes on the Steward, but he fancy'd he ſaw the very Face of <hi>Trifaldi;</hi> and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Maſter, The Devil fetch me, Sir, quoth he, if you don't own that this ſame Steward of the Duke's here has the very Phiz of my Lady <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faldi.</hi> Don <hi>Quixote</hi> look'd very earneſtly on the Steward; and having perus'd him from Top to Toe, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid he, thou need'ſt not give thy ſelf to the Devil to confirm this Matter: I ſee their Faces are the very ſame; yet for all that the Steward and the diſconſolate Lady cannot be the ſame Perſon, for that would imply a very great Contradiction, and might involve us into more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe and difficult Doubts than we have Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency now to diſcuſs or examine. Believe me, Friend, our Devotion cannot be too earneſt, that we may be deliver'd from the Power of theſe curſed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments. Adad, Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> you may think I'm in Jeſt; but I heard him open juſt now, and I thought the very Voice of Madam <hi>Trifaldi</hi> ſounded in my Ears: But Mum's the Word; I ſay nothing, tho' I ſhall watch his Waters to find out whether I am right or wrong in my Suſpicion. Well do ſo, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> and fail not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint me with all the Diſcoveries thou can'ſt make in this Affair, and other Occurrences in thy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                        <p>At laſt <hi>Sancho</hi> ſet out, with a numerous Trai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>. He was dreſs'd like a Man of the long Robe, and wore over his other Cloaths a wide ſad-colour'd Coat or Gown of water'd Camlet, and a Cap of the ſame Stuff. He was mounted on a He Mule,
<pb n="1037" facs="tcp:54446:562"/>
and rid ſhort after the Gennet-Faſhion. Behind him, by the Duke's Order, was led his <hi>Dapple,</hi> bridl'd and ſaddl'd like a Horſe of State, in gaudy Trappings of Silk; which ſo delighted <hi>Sancho,</hi> that every now and then he turn'd his Head about to look upon him, and thought himſelf ſo happy, that now he would not have chang'd Fortunes with the Emperor of <hi>Germany.</hi> He kiſs'd the Duke and Dutcheſs's Hands at Parting, and receiv'd his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's Benediction, while the Don wept and <hi>Sancho</hi> blubber'd abundantly.</p>
                        <p>Now, Reader, let the noble Governour depart in Peace, and ſpeed him well. His Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his Government may perhaps make you laugh to ſome Purpoſe when it comes in Play. But in the mean Time let us obſerve the Fortune of his Maſter the ſame Night; for tho' it don't make you laugh outright, it may chance to make ye draw in your Lips, and ſhew your Teeth like a Monkey; for 'tis the Property of his Adventures to create always either Surprize or Merriment.</p>
                        <p>'Tis reported then, that immediately upon <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi>'s Departure, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> found the wan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> of his Preſence, and had it been in his Power, he would have revok'd his Authority, and depriv'd him of his Commiſſion. The Dutcheſs perceiving his Diſquiet, and deſiring to underſtand the Cauſe of his Melancholy, told him, that if it was <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Abſence made him uneaſy, ſhe had Squires enough and Damſels in her Houſe, that ſhou'd ſupply his Place in any Service he wou'd be pleas'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand 'em. 'Tis true, Madam, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> I am ſomewhat concern'd for the Abſence of <hi>Sancho;</hi> but there is a more material Cauſe of my preſent Uneaſineſs; and I muſt beg to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd, if among the many Obligations your Grace is pleas'd to confer on me, I decline all but the
<pb n="1038" facs="tcp:54446:563"/>
good Intention that has offer'd 'em. All I have further to crave, is your Grace's Permiſſion to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in my Apartment, and to be my own Servant. Your Pardon, Sir, reply'd the Dutcheſs; I can't conſent you ſhou'd be alone: I have four Damſels, blooming as ſo many Roſes, that ſhall attend you. They will be no Roſes to me, return'd Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote,</hi> but ſo many Prickles to my Conſcience; and if they come into my Chamber, they muſt fly in at the Window. If your Grace would crown the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Favours you have heap'd on this worthleſs Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I beſeech you leave him to himſelf, and the Service of his own Hands. No Deſires, Madam, muſt enter my Doors; for the Walls of my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber have always been a Bulwark to my Chaſtity, and I ſhall not infringe my Rule for all the Bounty you can laviſh on me. In fine, rather than think of being undreſs'd by any Mortal, I would lie rough the whole Night. Enough, enough, noble Sir, ſaid the Dutcheſs; I deſiſt, and will give Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that not ſo much as the Buzzing of a Fly, much leſs the Impertinence of a Damſel, ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb your Privacy. I am far from impoſing any thing, Sir, that ſhould urge Don <hi>Quixote</hi> to a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion in Point of Decency; for if I conjecture right, among the many Virtues that adorn him, his Modeſty is the moſt diſtinguiſhable. Dreſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and undreſs by your ſelf, how you pleaſe, when you will, and no Body ſhall moleſt you: Nay, that you may not be oblig'd to open your Doors upon the Account of any natural Neceſſity, Care ſhall be taken that you may find in your Room whatever you may have Occaſion for in the Night. And may the great <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo</hi> live a thouſand Ages, and her Fame be diffus'd all over the habitable Globe, ſince ſhe has merited the Love of ſo valorous, ſo chaſte, and loyal a Knight;
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:54446:563"/>
and may the indulgent Heavens incline the Heart of our Governour, <hi>Sancho Pança,</hi> to put a ſpeedy End to his Diſcipline, that the Beauties of ſo great a Lady may be reſtor'd to the View of the admiring World. Madam, return'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> your Grace has ſpoken like your ſelf; ſo excellent a Lady cou'd utter nothing but what denotes the Goodneſs and Generoſity of her Mind: And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly 'twill be <hi>Dulcinea</hi>'s peculiar Happineſs to have been prais'd by you; for 'twill raiſe her Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter more to have had your Grace for her Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyriſt, than if the beſt Orators in the World had labour'd to ſet it forth. Sir, ſaid the Dutcheſs, waving this Diſcourſe, 'tis Supper-time, and my Lord expects us: Come then, let's to Supper, that you may go to Bed betimes; for you muſt needs be weary ſtill with the long Journey you took to <hi>Candaya</hi> Yeſterday. Indeed, Madam, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> I feel no Manner of Wearineſs; for I can ſafely ſwear to your Grace, that I never rid an eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Beaſt, nor a better Goer than <hi>Clavileno.</hi> For my Part, I can't imagine what cou'd induce <hi>Malambru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> to part with ſo ſwift and gentle a Horſe, nay, and to burn him too in ſuch a Manner. 'Tis to be ſuppos'd ſaid the Dutcheſs, that being ſorry for the Harm he had done, not only to the Counteſs <hi>Trifaldi</hi> and her Attendants, but to many others, and repenting of the bad Deeds which, as a Wizard and a Necromancer, he doubtleſs had committed, he had a Mind to deſtroy all the Inſtruments of his wicked Profeſſion, and accordingly he burn'd <hi>Clavileno</hi> as the chief of 'em, that Engine having ſerv'd him to rove all over the World: Or perhaps he did not think any Man worthy of beſtriding him after the great Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and ſo with his Deſtruction, and the Inſcription which he has caus'd to be ſet up, he has eterniz'd your Valour.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="1040" facs="tcp:54446:564"/>Don <hi>Quixote</hi> return'd his Thanks to the Dutcheſs, and after Supper retir'd to his Chamber, not ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Body to attend him; ſo much he fear'd to meet ſome Temptation that might endanger the Fidelity which he had conſecrated to his <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> keeping always the Eyes of his Mind fix'd on the Conſtancy of <hi>Amadis,</hi> the Flower and Mirror of Knight-Errantry. He therefore ſhut the Door of his Chamber after him, and undreſs'd himſelf by the Light of two Wax-Candles. But oh the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune that befell him, unworthy ſuch a Perſon! As he was ſtraining to pull off his Hoſe, there fell — not any thing that might diſgrace his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Cleanlineſs, but about four and twenty Stitches of one of his Stockings, which made it look like a Lattice-Window. The good Knight was extremely afflicted, and wou'd have given then an Ounce of Silver for a Dram of green Silk; green Silk, I ſay, becauſe his Stockings were green.</p>
                        <p>Here <hi>Benengeli</hi> could not forbear exclaiming: O Poverty! Poverty! What could induce that great <hi>Cordova</hi> P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>et to call thee a holy thankleſs Gift! Even I that am a <hi>Moor,</hi> have learn'd by the Converſe I have had with Chriſtians, that Holineſs conſiſts in Charity, in Humility, in Faith, in O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and in Poverty: But ſure he who can be contented when poor, had need to be ſtrengthen'd by God's peculiar Grace, unleſs the Poverty which is included among theſe Virtues, be only that Poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Spirit which teaches us to uſe the things of this World as if we had 'em not. But thou, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Poverty, fatal Indigence, of which I now am ſpeaking, why doſt thou intrude upon Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and affect well born Souls more than other People? Why doſt thou reduce them to cobble their Shooes? and wear ſome Silk, ſome Hair,
<pb n="1041" facs="tcp:54446:564"/>
and ſome Glaſs-Buttons on the ſame tatter'd Waſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat, as it were only to betray Variety of Wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs? Why muſt their Ruffs be of ſuch a diſmal Hue, in Rags, dirty, rumpl'd, and ill ſtarch'd? (and by this you may ſee how ancient is the uſe of Starch and Ruffs.) How miſerable is a poor Gentleman, who, to keep up his Honour, ſtarves his Perſon, fares ſorrily, or faſts unſeen within his ſolitary narrow Apartment; then putting the beſt Face he can upon the Matter, comes out picking his Teeth, tho' 'tis but an honourable Hypocriſy, and tho' he has eaten nothing that requires that nice Exerciſe. Unhappy he, whoſe Honour is in continual Alarms, who thinks that at a Mile's Diſtance every one diſcovers the Patch in his Shooe, the Sweat of his Forehead ſoak'd thro' his old ruſty Hat, the Bareneſs of his Cloaths, and the very Hunger of his famiſh'd Stomach.</p>
                        <p>All theſe melancholy Reflections were renew'd on Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Mind by the Rent in his Stocking. However, for his Conſolation, he bethought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that <hi>Sancho</hi> had left him a Pair of light Boots, which he deſign'd to put on the next Day.</p>
                        <p>In ſhort, to Bed he went, with a penſive heavy Mind, the thoughts of <hi>Sancho</hi>'s abſence, and the irreparable dammage that his Stocking had receiv'd, made him uneaſie: He would have darn'd it, though it had been with Silk of another Colour, one of the greateſt Tokens of want a poor Gentleman can give, during the courſe of his tedious Miſery.</p>
                        <p>At laſt he put out the Lights; but 'twas ſultry hot, and he could not compoſe himſelf to Reſt. Getting up therefore, he open'd a little Shutter of a barr'd Window that look'd into a fine Garden, and was preſently ſenſible that ſome People were walking and talking there: He liſten'd, and as they
<pb n="1042" facs="tcp:54446:565"/>
rais'd their Voices, he eaſily overheard their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
                        <p>No more, dear <hi>Emereneia,</hi> ſaid one to the other: Do not preſs me to ſing; you know that from the firſt moment this Stranger came to the Caſtle, and my unhappy Eyes gaz'd on him, I have been too converſant with Tears and Sorrow, to ſing or reliſh Songs. Alas! all Muſick jars when the Soul's out of Tune. Beſides, you know the leaſt thing wakens my Lady, and I would not for the World ſhe ſhould find us here. But grant ſhe might not wake, what will my Singing ſignify if this new <hi>Aeneas,</hi> who is come to our Habitation to make me wretched, ſhould be aſleep, and not hear the ſound of my Complaints? Pray, my dear <hi>Altiſidora,</hi> ſaid the other, do not make your ſelf uneaſie with thoſe Thoughts; for without doubt the Dutcheſs is faſt aſleep; and every Body in the Houſe but we and the Lord of thy Deſires; he is certainly awake, I heard him open his Window juſt now; then ſing, my poor grieving Creature, ſing, and joyn the melting Muſick of thy Lute to the ſoft Accents of thy Voice. If my Lady happens to hear us, we'll pretend we came out for a little Air. The heat within doors will be our excuſe. Alas! my dear, reply'd <hi>Altiſidora,</hi> 'tis not that frights me moſt. I would not have my Song betray my Thoughts; for thoſe that do not know the mighty force of Love, will be apt to take me for a light and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Creature—But yet ſince it muſt be ſo, I'll venture: Better ſhame on the Face, than ſorrow in the Heart! This ſaid, ſhe began to touch her Lute ſo ſweetly, that Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was raviſh'd. At the ſame time an infinite number of Adventures of this nature, ſuch as he had read of in his idle Books of Knight-Errantry, Windows, Grates, Gardens, Serenades, amorous Meetings, Parleys and Fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periers,
<pb n="1043" facs="tcp:54446:565"/>
all crowded into his Imagination; and he preſently fancy'd, that one of the Dutcheſs's Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels was fall'n in Love with him, and ſtruggl'd with her Modeſty to conceal her Paſſion. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be apprehenſive of the danger to which his Fidelity was expos'd, but yet firmly determin'd to withſtand the powerful Allurement, and ſo recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending himſelf with a great deal of Fervency to his Lady <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo,</hi> he reſolv'd to hear the Muſick; and to let the Serenading Ladies know he was awake, he feign'd a kind of a Sneeze, which did not a little pleaſe 'em; for 'twas the only thing they wanted, to be aſſur'd their Jeſt was not loſt. With that, <hi>Altiſidora</hi> having tun'd her Lute afreſh, after a Flouriſh, began the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Song.</p>

                           <hi>Sancho,</hi> with all his Attendants, came to a Town that had about a thouſand Inhabitants, and was one of the beſt where the Duke had any Power: They gave him to underſtand that the Name of the Place was the Iſland of <hi>Barataria,</hi> either becauſe the Town was called <hi>Baratario,</hi> or becauſe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment coſt him ſo<note n="*" place="bottom">

<pb n="1048" facs="tcp:54446:568"/>
came to the Gates, (for it was Wall'd) the chief Officers and Inhabitants in their Formalities came out to receive him, the Bells rung, and all the People gave general Demonſtrations of their Joy. The new Governour was then carry'd in mighty Pomp to the great Church, to give Heaven Thanks; and after ſome ridiculous Ceremonies they deliver'd him the Keys of the Gates, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd him as perpetual Governour of the Iſland of <hi>Barataria.</hi> In the mean time, the Garb, the Port, the huge Beard, and the ſhort and thick Shape of the new Governour, made every one who knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Jeſt wonder, and even thoſe who were privy to the Plot, who were many, were not a little ſurpriz'd.</p>
                        <p>In ſhort, from the Church they carry'd him to the Court of Juſtice; where when they had plac'd him in his Seat, My Lord Governour, ſaid the Duke's Steward to him, 'tis an ancient Cuſtom here that he who takes Poſſeſſion of this famous Iſland, muſt anſwer to ſome difficult and intricate Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is propounded to him; and by the Return he makes, the People feel the Pulſe of his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and by an Eſtimate of his Abilities, judge whether they ought to rejoyce or to be ſorry for his coming.</p>
                        <p>All the while the Steward was ſpeaking, <hi>Sanch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> on the Wall over againſt his Seat; and as he could not read, he ask'd what was the Meaning of that which he ſaw painted there upon the Wall? Sir, ſaid they, 'Tis an account of the Day when your Lordſhip took poſſeſſion of this Iſland: And the Inſcription runs thus. <hi>This Day, being ſuch a day of this Month, in ſuch a Year, the Lord Don</hi> Sancho Pança <hi>took Poſſeſſion of this Iſland, which may he long enjoy.</hi> And who is he, ask'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> whom they call Don <hi>Sancho Pança?</hi> Your Lordſhip, anſwer'd the
<pb n="1049" facs="tcp:54446:568"/>
Steward; for we know of no other <hi>Pança</hi> in this Iſland but your ſelf who now ſits in this Chair. Well, Friend, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> pray take notice, That Don does not belong to me, neither was it born to me, neither was it born by any of my Family before me. Plain <hi>Sancho Pança</hi> is my Name: My Father was call'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> my Grand-father <hi>Sancho;</hi> and all of us have been <hi>Pança</hi>'s, without any Don or Donna before our Name. Now do I already gueſs your Dons are as thick as Stones in this Iſland. But 'tis enough that Heaven knows my Meaning; if my Government happens but to laſt four Days to an end, it ſhall go hard but I'll clear the Iſland of thoſe ſwarms of Dons that muſt needs be as troubleſom as ſo many Fleſh-flies: Come, now for your Queſton, good Mr. Steward, and I'll anſwer it as well as I can, whether the Town be ſorry or pleas'd.</p>
                        <p>At the ſame inſtant two Men came into the Court, the one dreſs'd like a Country Fellow, the other look'd like a Tailor, with a pair of Sheers in his hand. An't pleaſe you, my Lord, cry'd the Taylor, I and this Farmer here are come before your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. This honeſt Man came to my Shop yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; for, ſaving your Preſence, I am a Tailor, and Heaven be prais'd free of my Company. So my Lord, he ſhew'd me a piece of Cloath: Sir quoth he, is there enough of this to make me a Cap? Whereupon I meaſur'd the Stuff, and anſwer'd him yes, an't like your Worſhip. Now as I imagine, d'ye ſee, he could not but imagine (and perhaps he imagin'd right enough) that I had a mind to cabbage ſome of his Cloath; judging hard of us honeſt Tailors. Prithee, quoth he, look whether there been't enough for two Caps? Now I ſmelt him out, and told him there was. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Old Knave (an't like your Worſhip)
<pb n="1050" facs="tcp:54446:569"/>
going on to the ſame Tune, bid me look again, and ſee whether it would not make three? And at laſt if it would not make five? I was reſolv'd to humour my Cuſtomer, and ſaid it might. So we ſtruck a Bargain; juſt now the Man is come for his Caps, which I gave him, but when I ask him for my Money, he'll have me give him his Cloath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, or pay him for't. Is this true, honeſt Man, ſaid <hi>Sancho</hi> to the Farmer? Yes, an't pleaſe you, anſwer'd the Fellow; but pray let him ſhew the five Caps he has made me. With all my Heart, cry'd the Tailor; and with that, pulling his hand from under his Cloak, he held up five little tiny Caps hanging upon his four Fingers and Thumb, as upon ſo many Pins. There, quoth he; you ſee the five Caps this good Gaffer asks for; and may I never whip a ſtitch more, if I have wrong'd him of the leaſt ſnip of his Cloath, and let any Work-man be Judge. The ſight of the Caps and the oddneſs of the Cauſe ſet the whole Court a laughing. Only <hi>Sancho</hi> ſat gravely conſidering a while, and then, Methinks, ſaid he, this Suit here need not be long depending, but may be decided without any more ado, with a great deal of Equity; and therefore the Judgment of the Court is, That the Tailor ſhall loſe his Making, and the Country-Man his Cloath, and that the Caps be given to the poor Priſoners, and ſo let there be an end of the Buſineſs.</p>
                        <p>If this Sentence provok't the Laughter of the whole Court, the next, no leſs rais'd their Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. For after the Governour's Order was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, two old Men appear'd before him, one of 'em with a large Cane in his Hand, which he us'd as a Staff. My Lord, ſaid the other who had none, ſome time ago I lent this Man ten Gold-Crowns to do him a kindneſs; which Money he was to repay me on Demand. I did not ask him
<pb n="1051" facs="tcp:54446:569"/>
for it again in a good While, leſt it ſhould prove a greater Inconveniency to him to repay me, than he labour'd under when he borrow'd it: However, perceiving that he took no care to pay me, I have ask'd him for my Due; nay, I have been forc'd to dun him hard for it. But ſtill he did not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to pay me again, but deny'd he ow'd me any Thing, and ſaid, that if I lent him ſo much Money, he certainly return'd it: Now, becauſe I have no Witneſſes of the Loan, nor he of the pretended Payment, I beſeech your Lordſhip to put him to his Oath; and if he will ſwear he has paid me, I'll freely forgive him before God and the World. What ſay you to this, old Gentleman with the Staff, ask'd <hi>Sancho?</hi> Sir, anſwer'd the old Man, I own he lent me the Gold; and ſince he requires my Oath; I beg you'll be pleas'd to hold down your Rod of Juſtice, that I may ſwear upon't, how I have honeſtly and truly return'd him his Money. Thereupon the Governour held down his Rod, and in the mean time the Defendant gave his Cane to the Plaintiff to hold as if it hinder'd him, while he was to make a Croſs, and ſwear over the Judge's Rod: This done, he declar'd, That 'twas true the other had lent him the ten Crowns; but that he had really return'd him the ſame Sum into his own Hands; and that becauſe he ſuppos'd the Plaintiff had forgot it, he was continually asking him for it. The great Governour hearing this, ask'd the Creditor what he had to reply? He made Anſwer, that ſince his Adverſary had ſworn it, he was ſatiſfy'd; for he believ'd him to be a better Chriſtian than to offer to foreſwear himſelf, and that perhaps he had forgot he had been repaid. Then the Defendant took his Cane again, and having made a low Obeiſance to the Judge, was immediately leaving the Court. Which when

                           <hi>Sancho</hi> perceiv'd, reflectiong on the Paſſage of the Cane, and admiring the Creditor's Patience, after he had ſtudy'd a while, with his Head leaning over his Stomach, and his Fore-finger on his Noſe, on a ſudden he order'd the old Man with the Staff to be call'd back. When he was return'd, honeſt Man, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> let me ſee that Cane a little; I have a Uſe for't. With all my Heart, anſwer'd the other; Sir, here it is; and with that he gave it him. <hi>Sancho</hi> took it; and giving it the other old Man, There, ſaid he, go your ways, and Heaven be with you; for now you're paid. How ſo, my Lord, cry'd the old Man? Do you judge this Cane to be worth ten Gold-Crowns? Certainly, ſaid the Governour, or elſe I am the greateſt Dunce in the World. And now ye ſhall ſee whether I have not a Head-piece fit to govern a whole Kingdom upon a ſhift. This ſaid, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the Cane to be broken in open Court, which was no ſooner done, but out dropp'd the ten Crowns. All the Spectators were amaz'd, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to look on their Governour as a ſecond <hi>Solomon.</hi> They ask'd him how he could conjecture that the ten Crowns were in the Cane? He told 'em, that, having obſerv'd how the Defendant gave it to the Plaintiff to hold while he took his Oath, and then ſwore he had truly return'd him the Money in his own Hands, after which he took his Cane again from the Plaintiff; this conſider'd, it came into his Head, that the Money was lodg'd within the Reed. From whence may be learn'd, that though ſometimes thoſe that govern are deſtitute of Senſe, yet it often pleaſes God to direct 'em in their Judgments. Beſides, he had heard the Curate of his Pariſh tell of ſuch another Buſineſs; and he had ſo ſpecial a Memory, that were it not that he was ſo unlucky as to forget all he had a mind to
<pb n="1053" facs="tcp:54446:570"/>
remember, there could not have been a better in the whole Iſland. At laſt the two old Men went away, the one to his Satisfaction, the other with eternal Shame and Diſgrace, and the Beholders were aſtoniſh'd: Inſomuch that the Perſon, who was commiſſion'd to Regiſter <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Words and Actions, and obſerve his Behaviour, was not able to determine whether he ſhould not give him the Character of a wiſe Man, inſtead of that of a Fool, which he had been thought to deſerve.</p>
                        <p>No ſooner was this Tryal over, but in came a Woman, haling along a Man that look'd like a good ſubſtantial Grazier. Juſtice, my Lord Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, Juſtice, cry'd ſhe aloud; and if I cannot have it on Earth, I'll have it from Heaven! Sweet Lord Governour, this wicked Fellow met me in the Middle of a Field, and has had the full Uſe of my Body; he has handl'd me like a Diſhclout. Woe's me, he has robb'd me of that which I had kept theſe three and twenty Years. Wretch that I am, I had guarded it ſafe from Natives and Foreigners, Chriſtians and Infidels! I have been always as tough as Cork; no Salmander ever kept it ſelf more entire in Fire, nor no Wool among the Briers, than did poor I, till this lewd Man with naſty Fiſts handl'd me at this rate. Woman, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> no Reflections yet; whether your Gallant's Hands were naſty or clean, that's not to the Purpoſe. Then turning to the Grazier, Well, Friend, ſaid he, what have you to ſay to this Woman's Complaint? My Lord, (anſwer'd the Man, looking as if he had been frighted out his Wits) I am a poor Drover, a Hog-man, and this Morning I was going home from this Market, where I had ſold (under correction be it ſpoken) four Hogs, and what with the Duties and the ſharping Tricks of the Officers, I hardly clear'd
<pb n="1054" facs="tcp:54446:571"/>
any Thing by the Beaſts. Now as I was trudging home, whom ſhould I pick up by the Way but this Hedge-Madam here; and the Devil, who has a Finger in every Pye, being powerful, forc'd us to yoke together. I gave her that which would have contented any reaſonable Woman; but ſhe was not ſatisfied, and wanted more Money; and would never leave me, till ſhe had dragg'd me hither. She'll tell ye I raviſh'd her; but, by the Oath I've taken, or mean to take, ſhe lies like a Drab as ſhe is, and this is every Tittle true. Fellow, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> haſt thou any Silver about thee? Yes, an't like your Worſhip, anſwer'd the Drover, I have ſome twenty Ducats in Silver in a leathern Purſe here in my Boſom. Give it the Plaintiff, Money and all, quoth <hi>Sancho.</hi> The Man with a trembling Hand did as he was commanded: The Woman took it, and dropp'd a thouſand Curtſies to the Company, wiſhing on her Knees as many Bleſſings to the good Governour, who took ſuch ſpecial Care of poor Fatherleſs and Motherleſs Children, and abus'd Virgins; and then ſhe nimbly tripp'd out of Court, holding the Purſe faſt in both her Hands; though firſt ſhe took care to Peep into it, to ſee whether the Silver were there. Scarce was ſhe gone, when <hi>Sancho,</hi> turning to the Fellow, who ſtood with the Tears in his Eyes, and look'd as if he had parted with his Blood as well as his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: Friend, ſaid he, run and overtake the Woman, and take the Purſe from her, whether ſhe will or no, and bring it hither. The Drover was neither ſo deaf nor ſo mad as to be twice bid; away he flew like Lightning after his Money. The whole Court was in mighty Expectation, and could not tell what could be the End of the Matter. But a while after the Man and the Woman came back, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="1055" facs="tcp:54446:571"/>
Petticoat tuck'd up, and the Purſe in her Boſom, and he uſing all the Strength he had to get it from her. But it was to no purpoſe; for the Woman defended her Prize ſo well, that all his Manhood little avail'd. Juſtice, cry'd ſhe, for Heaven's ſake, Juſtice, Gentlemen! Look you, my Lord, ſee this impudent Ruffian, that on the King's High-way, nay, in the Face of the Court, would rob me of my Purſe, the very Purſe you condemn'd him to give me. And has he got it from you, ask'd the Governour? Got it, quoth the Woman! I'll loſe my Life before I'll loſe my Purſe. I were a pretty Baby then, to let him wipe my Noſe thus! No, you muſt ſet other Dogs upon me than this ſorry ſneaking mangy Whelp; Pincers, Hammers, Mallets, and Chizzels ſhan't wrench it out of my Clutches; no, not the Claws of a Lion; they ſhall ſooner have my Soul than my Money. She ſays the Truth, my Lord, ſaid the Fellow, for I am quite ſpent: The Jade is too ſtrong for me; I cannot grapple with her. <hi>Sancho</hi> then call'd to the Pemale. Here, quoth he, Honeſty! You She-Dragon, let me ſee the Purſe. The Woman deliver'd it to him; and then he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd it to the Man; Hark you Miſtreſs, ſaid he to her, had you ſhew'd your ſelf as ſtout and valiant to defend your Body, (nay, but half ſo much) as you've done to defend your Purſe, the Strength of <hi>Hercules</hi> could not have forc'd you. Hence, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence, get out of my Sight. Away, with a Pox to you; and do not offer to ſtay in this Iſland, nor within ſix Leagues of it, on pain of two hundred Laſhes. Out, as faſt as you can, you tricking, brazen-fac'd, Brimſtone, Hedge-Drab, away. The Wench was in a terrible fright, and ſneak'd away, hanging down her Head as ſhamefully as if ſhe had been catch'd in the Deed of Darkneſs. Now
<pb n="1056" facs="tcp:54446:572"/>
Friend, (ſaid the Governour to the Man) get you home with your Money, and Heaven be with you. But another Time, if you han't a mind to come off worſe, be ſure you don't yoke with ſuch Cattle. The Drover thank'd him as indifferently as he could, and away he went; and all the People admir'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh their new Governour's Judgment and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. An Account of which was taken by him that was appointed to be his Hiſtoriographer, and forthwith tranſmitted to the Duke, who expected it with Impatience. Now let us leave honeſt <hi>Sancho</hi> here; for his Maſter with great Earneſtneſs requires our Attendance, <hi>Altiſidora</hi>'s Serenade hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrangely diſcompos'd his Mind.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XLVI.</hi> Of the dreadful Alarms given to Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote</hi> by the Bells and Cats, during the Courſe of <hi>Altiſidora</hi>'s Amours.</head>
                        <p>WE left the great Don <hi>Quixote</hi> profoundly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the Thoughts into which the ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd <hi>Altiſidora</hi>'s Serenade had plung'd him. He threw himſelf into his Bed; but the Cares and Anxieties which he brought thither with him, like ſo many Fleas, allow'd him no Repoſe, and the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune of his torn Stocking added to his Affliction. But as Time is ſwift, and no Bolts nor Chains, can bar his rapid Progreſs, poſting away on the Wings of the Hours, the Morning ſoon revolv'd. At the Return of Light, Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> more early than the Sun, forſook his downy Bed, put on his Shamoy-Apparel,
<pb n="1057" facs="tcp:54446:572"/>
and drawing on his walking Boots, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd in one of 'em the Diſaſter of his Hoſe; he threw his Scarlet Cloak over his Shoulder, and clapp'd on his Valiant Head his Cap of Green Velvet edg'd with Silver Lace. Over his right Shoulder he hung his Belt, the Suſtainer of his truſty executing Sword. About his Wriſt he wore the Roſary which he always carry'd about him; and thus accoutred, with a great deal of State and Majeſty, he mov'd towards the Anti-Chamber, where the Duke and Dutcheſs were ready dreſs'd, and in a manner expecting his Coming. As he went through a Gallery he met <hi>Altiſidora</hi> and her Companion, who waited for him in the Paſſage; and no ſooner did <hi>Altiſidora</hi> eſpy him, but ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembl'd a ſwooning Fit, and immediately dropp'd into the Arms of her Friend, who preſently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to unlace her Stays. Which Don <hi>Quixote</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, he approach'd, and turning to the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, I know the Meaning of all this, ſaid he, and whence theſe Accidents proceed. You know more than I do, anſwer'd the aſſiſting Damſel: But this I am ſure of, That hitherto there's not a Damſel in this Houſe, that has enjoy'd her Health better than <hi>Altiſidora;</hi> I never knew her make the leaſt Complaint before. A Vengeance ſeize all the Knights-Errant in the World, if they are all ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful. Pray my Lord Don <hi>Quixote</hi> retire, for this poor young Creature will not come to her ſelf as long as you are by. Madam, anſwer'd the Knight, I beg that a Lute may be left in my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber this Evening, that I may aſſwage this Lady's Grief as well as I can; for in the Beginning of an Amour, a ſpeedy and free Diſcovery of our Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or Pre-engagement is the moſt effectual Cure. This ſaid, he left 'em, that he might not be found alone with them by thoſe that might happen to go
<pb n="1058" facs="tcp:54446:573"/>
by. He was ſcarce gone, but <hi>Altiſidora</hi>'s counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited Fit was over, and turning to her Companion, By all means, ſaid ſhe, let him have a Lute; for without doubt the Knight has a Mind to give us ſome Muſick, and we ſhall have Sport enough. Then they went and acquainted the Dutcheſs with their Proceedings, and Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s deſiring a Lute; whereupon, being over-joy'd at the Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhe plotted with the Duke and her Women a new Contrivance to have a little harmleſs Sport with the Don. After this, they expected with a pleaſing Impatience the Return of Night, which ſtole upon them as faſt as had done the Day, which the Duke and Dutcheſs paſs'd in agreeable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with Don <hi>Quixote.</hi> The ſame Day ſhe really ſent away a Page of hers, who had perſonated <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinea</hi> in the Wood, to <hi>Tereſa Pança,</hi> with her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's Letter, and the Bundle of Cloaths which he had left behind, charging him to bring her back a faithful Account of every Particular between 'em.</p>
                        <p>At laſt, it being eleven a Clock at Night, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> retir'd to his Apartment, and finding a Lute there, he tun'd it, open'd the Window, and perceiving there was ſomebody walking in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, he ran over the Strings of the Inſtrument, and having tun'd it again as nicely as he could, he cough'd, and clear'd his Throat, and then with a Voice ſomewhat hoarſe, yet not unmuſical, he ſung the following Song, which he had compos'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that very Day.</p>

                        <p>No ſooner had Don <hi>Quixote</hi> made an End of his Song, to which the Duke, Dutcheſs, <hi>Altiſidora,</hi> and almoſt all the People in the Caſtle liſten'd all the While; but on a ſudden from an open Gallery that was directly over the Knight's Window, they let down a Rope, with at leaſt a hundred little tink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Bells hanging about it. After that came down a great Number of Cats, pour'd out of a huge Sack, all of 'em with ſmaller Bells ty'd to their Tails. The Jangling of the Bells, and the Meawing of the Cats made ſuch a diſmal Noiſe, that the very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers of the Jeſt themſelves were ſcar'd for the preſent, and Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was ſtrangely amaz'd and all diſmay'd. At the ſame time, as ill Luck would have it, two or three frighted Cats leap'd in through the Bars of his Chamber-Window, and running up and down the Room like ſo many evil Spirits; one would have thought a whole Legion of Devils had been flying about the Chamber. They put out the Candles that ſtood lighted there, and endeavoured to get out. Mean while the Rope with the bigger
<pb n="1061" facs="tcp:54446:574"/>
Bells about it was pull'd up and down, and thoſe who knew nothing of the Contrivance were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurpriz'd. At laſt, Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> recovering from his Aſtoniſhment, drew his Sword, and fenc'd and laid about him at the Window, crying aloud, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant ye wicked Inchanters, hence Infernal Scoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drels! for I am Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> and all your damn'd Devices cannot work their Ends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me. And then running after the Cars that frisk'd about the Room, he began to thruſt and cut at them furiouſly, while they ſtrove to get out. At laſt they made their Eſcape at the Window, all but one of 'em, who finding himſelf hard put to it, flew in his Face, and laying hold on his Noſe with his Claws and Teeth, put him to ſuch Pain, that the Don began to roar out as loud as he could. Thereupon the Duke and the Dutcheſs, imagining the Cauſe of his Out-cry, ran to his Aſſiſtance im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately; and having opened the Door of his Chamber with a Maſter-Key, found the poor Knight ſtruggling hard with the Cat, that would not quit its Hold. By the Light of the Candles which they had with them they ſaw the unequal Combat: The Duke offer'd to interpoſe, and take off the Animal; but Don <hi>Quixote</hi> would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him. Let no body take him off, cry'd he; let me alone hand to hand with this Devil, this Sorcerer, this Necromancer! I'll make him know what it is to deal with Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha.</hi> But the Cat, not minding his Threats, growl'd on, and ſtill held faſt; till at length the Duke got its Claws unhook'd from the Knight's Fleſh, and flung the Beaſt out at the Window. Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Face was hideouſly ſcratch'd, and his Noſe in no very good Condition: Yet nothing vex'd him ſo much as that they had reſcu'd out of his Hands that villainous Necromancer. Immediately ſome Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="1062" facs="tcp:54446:575"/>
was ſent for, and <hi>Altiſidora</hi> her ſelf, with her own Lilly-white Hands, apply'd ſome Plaiſters to his Sores, and whiſpering him in the Ear, as ſhe was dreſſing him, cruel hard-hearted Knight, ſaid ſhe, all theſe Diſaſters are befallen thee, as a juſt Puniſhment for thy obdurate Stubbornneſs and Diſdain. May thy Squire <hi>Sancho</hi> forget to whip himſelf, that thy Darling <hi>Dulcinea</hi> may never be deliver'd from her Inchantment, nor thou ever be bleſs'd with her Embraces, at leaſt ſo long as I thy neglected Adorer live. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> made no Anſwer at all to this, only he heav'd up a profound Sigh, and then went to take his Repoſe, after he had return'd the Duke and Dutcheſs Thanks, not ſo much for their Aſſiſtance againſt that raſcally Crew of catterwauling and jangling Inchanters, for he defy'd 'em all, but for their Kindneſs and good Intent. Then the Duke and the Dutcheſs left him not a little troubl'd at the Miſcarriage of their Jeſt, which they did not think would have prov'd ſo fatal to the Knight, as to oblige him, as it did, to keep his Chamber five Days. During which Time there happen'd to him another Adventure more pleaſant than the laſt; which however can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be now related; for the Hiſtorian muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Sancho Pança,</hi> who was very buſie, and no leſs pleaſant in his Government.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XLVII.</hi> A further Account of <hi>Sancho Pança's</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour in his Government.</head>
                        <p>THE Hiſtory informs us, that <hi>Sancho</hi> was conducted from the Court of Juſtice to a ſumptuous Palace; where, in a ſpacious Room he found the Cloth laid, and a moſt neat and magnificent Entertainment prepar'd. As ſoon as he enter'd, the Wind-Muſick play'd, and four Pages waited on him, in order to the waſhing of his Hands; which he did with a great deal of Gravity. And now the Inſtruments ceaſing, <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> ſat down at the upper-end of the Table; for there was no Seat but there, and the Cloth was only laid for one. A certain Perſonage, who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards appear'd to be a Phyſician, came and ſtood at his Elbow, with a Whale-bone Wand in his Hand. Then they took off a curious white Cloth that lay over the Diſhes on the Table, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd great Variety of Fruit, and other Eatables. One that look'd like a Student, ſaid Grace; a Page put a lac'd Bib under <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Chin; and another, who did the Office of Steward, ſet a Diſh of Fruit before him. But he had hardly put one bit into his Mouth before the Phyſician touch'd the Diſh with his Wand, and then it was taken away by a Page in an Inſtant. Immediately an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other with Meat was clapp'd in the Place; but <hi>Sancho</hi> no ſooner offer'd to taſte of it, but the Doctor with the Wand conjur'd it away as faſt
<pb n="1064" facs="tcp:54446:576"/>
as the Fruit. <hi>Sancho</hi> was amaz'd at this ſudden Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval, and looking about him on the Company, ask'd them whether they us'd to tantalize People at that rate, feeding their Eyes, and ſtarving their Bellies? My Lord Governour, anſwer'd the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, you are to eat here no otherwiſe than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Uſe and Cuſtom of other Iſlands where there are Governours. I am a Doctor of Phyſick, my Lord, and have a Salary allow'd me in this Iſland, for taking Charge of the Governour's Health, and I am more careful of it than of my own; ſtudying Night and Day his Conſtitution, that I may the better know what to preſcribe when he falls Sick. Now the chief Thing I do, is to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him always at his Meals, to let him Eat what I think convenient for him, and to prevent his Eating what I imagine to be prejudicial to his Health, and offenſive to his Stomach. Therefore I now order'd the Fruit to be taken away, becauſe 'tis exceeding moiſt, and the other Diſh, becauſe 'tis as much too hot, and over-ſeaſon'd with Spices, which are apt to encreaſe Thirſt, and he that drinks much, deſtroys and conſumes the radical Moiſture, which is the Fuel of Life. So then, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> this Diſh of roaſted Partridges here can do me no manner of Harm. Hold; ſaid the Phyſician, the Lord Governour ſhall not eat of 'em, while I live to prevent it. Why ſo, cry'd <hi>Sancho?</hi> Becauſe, anſwer'd the Doctor, our great Maſter <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> the North-Star, and Luminary of Phyſick, ſays in one of his Aphoriſms, <hi>Omnis Saturatio mala, perdicis autem peſſima:</hi> That is, all Repletion is bad, but that of Partridges is worſt of all. If it be ſo, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> let Mr. Doctor ſee which of all theſe Diſhes on the Table will do me moſt Good, and leaſt Harm, and let me eat my Belly-ful of that, without having it whisk'd away with his Wand. For, by my Hopes, and the
<pb n="1065" facs="tcp:54446:576"/>
Pleaſures of Government, as I live, I am ready to die with Hunger; and not to allow me to eat any Victuals (let Mr. Doctor ſay what he will) is the way to ſhorten my Life, and not to lengthen it. Very true, my Lord, reply'd the Phyſician, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I am of Opinion, you ought not to eat of theſe Rabbets, as being a tough and acute Kind of Food; nor wou'd I have you taſte of that Veal: Indeed if it were neither roaſted nor ſtew'd, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing might be ſaid; but as it is, it muſt not be. Well then, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> what think you of that huge Diſh yonder that ſmoaks ſo? I take it to be an <note n="*" place="margin">Tis what we corruptly call an <hi>Olio, all</hi> Sorts of Meat ſtew'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> 
                           <hi>Olla Podrida;</hi> and that being a Hodge-podge of ſo many Sorts of Victuals, ſure I can't but light upon Something there that will nick me, and be both wholeſome and toothſome. <hi>Abſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>,</hi> cry'd the Doctor, far be ſuch an ill Thought from us; no Diet in the World yields a worſe Nutriment than thoſe Miſhmaſhes do. No, leave that luxurious Compound to your rich Monks and Prebendaries, your Maſters of Colleges, and luſty Feeders at Country-Weddings. But let 'em not incumber the Tables of Governours, where nothing but delicate unmix'd Viands in their Prime ought to make a Figure. The Reaſon is, that Simple Medicines are generally allow'd to be better than Compounds; for in a Compoſition there may happen a Miſtake by the unequal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the Ingredients; but Simples are not ſubject to that Accident. Therefore what I wou'd adviſe at preſent, as a fit Diet for the Governour, for the Preſervation and Support of his Health, is a Hundred of ſmall Wafers, and a few thin Slices of Marmalade to ſtrengthen his Stomach, and help Digeſtion. <hi>Sancho</hi> hearing this, lean'd back
<pb n="1066" facs="tcp:54446:577"/>
upon his Chair, and looking earneſtly in the Doctor's Face, very ſeriouſly ask'd him what his Name was, and where he had ſtudied? My Lord, anſwer'd he I am call'd Doctor <hi>Pedro Rezio de Agu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Avoid the Room this Moment, or by the Life of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> I'll get me a good Cudgel, and beginning with your Carcaſs, will ſo be-labour and rib-roaſt all the Phyſick-mongers in the Iſland, that I'll not leave there one of the Tribe, of thoſe, I mean, that are Ignorant Quacks; for as for Learned and Wiſe Phyſicians, I'll make much of 'em, and honour 'em like ſo many Angels. Once more, <hi>Pedro Rezio,</hi> I ſay, get out of my Preſence. Avaunt! Or I'll take the Chair I ſit upon, and I'll comb your Head with it to ſome Purpoſe; and let me be call'd to an Account about it when I give up my Office, I don't care, I'll clear my ſelf by ſaying, I did the World good Service, in ridding it of a bad Phyſician, the Plague of a Common-wealth. Body of me! let me eat, or let 'em take their Government again; for an Office that won't afford a Man his Victuals is not worth two Horſe-Beans. The Phyſician was terrify'd, ſeeing the Governour in ſuch a Heat, and wou'd that Moment have ſlunk out of the Room, had not the Sound of a Poſt-Horn in the Street been heard that Moment; whereupon the Steward im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately looking out at the Window, turn'd back,
<pb n="1067" facs="tcp:54446:577"/>
and ſaid, there was an Expreſs come from the Duke, doubtleſs with ſome Diſpatch of Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                        <p>Preſently the Meſſenger enter'd ſweating, with Haſte and Concern in his Looks, and pulling a Packet out of his Boſom, deliver'd it to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour. <hi>Sancho</hi> gave it to the Steward, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd him to read the Direction, which was this: <hi>To Don</hi> Sancho Pança, <hi>Governour of the Iſland</hi> Bara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taria, <hi>to be deliver'd into his own Hands, or thoſe of his Secretary.</hi> Who is my Secretary, cry'd <hi>Sancho?</hi> 'Tis I, my Lord, (anſwer'd one that was by) for I can write and read, and am a <hi>Biſcayner.</hi> That laſt Qualification is enough to make thee ſet up for Secretary to the Emperor himſelf, ſaid <hi>Sancho.</hi> Open the Letter then, and ſee what it ſays. The new Secretary did ſo, and having perus'd the Diſpatch by himſelf, told the Governour, that 'twas a Buſineſs that was to be told only in Private: <hi>Sancho</hi> order'd every one to leave the Room, except the Steward and the Carver, and then the Secretary read what follows.</p>

                           <hi>Sancho</hi> was aſtoniſh'd at the News, and thoſe that were with him ſeem'd no leſs concern'd. But at laſt, turning to the Steward, I'll tell you, ſaid he, what is firſt to be done in this Caſe, and that with all Speed; Clap me that ſame Doctor <hi>Rezio</hi> in a Dungeon; for if any Body has a Mind to kill me, it muſt be he, and that with a lingring Death, the worſt of Deaths, Hunger-ſtarving. However, ſaid the Carver, I am of Opinion, your Honour ought not to eat any of the Things that ſtand here before ye; for they were ſent in by ſome of the Convents, and 'tis a common Saying, <hi>The Devil <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Mean while, Secretary, do you ſend my Lord Duke an Anſwer, and tell him his Order ſhall be fulfill'd in every Part without fail. Remember me kindly to my Lady Dutcheſs, and beg of her not to forget to ſend one on purpoſe with my Letter and Bundle to <hi>Tereſa Pança</hi> my Wife; which I ſhall take as a ſpecial Favour, and I will be mindful to ſerve her to the beſt of my Power: And when your Hand's in, you may croud in my Service to my Maſter

Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> that he may ſee I am neither forgetful nor ungrateful, The reſt I leave to you; put in what you will, and do your Part like a good Secretary and a ſtanch <hi>Biſcayner.</hi> Now take away here, and bring me ſomething to eat; and then you ſhall ſee I am able to deal with all the Spies, Wizzards, and cut-throat Dogs that dare to meddle with me and my Iſland.</p>
                        <p>At that Time a Page entring the Room, My Lord, ſaid he, there's a Country-man without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to ſpeak with your Lordſhip about Buſineſs of great Conſequence. 'Tis a ſtrange Thing, cry'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> that one muſt ſtill be plagu'd with theſe Men of Buſineſs! Is it poſſible they ſhou'd be ſuch Sots, as not to underſtand this is not a Time for Buſineſs? Do they fancy, that we Governours and Diſtributors of Juſtice are made of Iron and Marble, and have no need of Reſt and Refreſhment like other Creatures of Fleſh and Blood. Well, before Heaven, and o' my Conſcience, if my Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment does but laſt, as I ſhrewdly gueſs it will not, I'll get one of theſe Men of Buſineſs laid by the Heels Well, for once let the Fellow come in— But firſt take Heed he ben't one of the Spies or Ruffian-Rogues that would murder me. As for that, ſaid the Page, I dare ſay he had no Hand in the Plot; poor Soul, he looks as if he could not help it; there's no more Harm in him to ſee to than in a Piece of good Bread There's no need to fear, ſaid the Steward, ſince we are all here by you. But hark you, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> now Dr. <hi>Razio</hi>'s gone, might not I eat ſomething that has ſome Subſtance in it, though it were but a Cruſt and an Onion? At Night, anſwer'd the Carver, your Honour ſhall have no Cauſe to complain: Supper ſhall make Amends for the Want of your Dinner. Heaven grant it may, ſaid <hi>Sancho.</hi>
                        </p>

                           <pb n="1070" facs="tcp:54446:579"/>Now the Country-man came in, and by his Looks ſeem'd to be a good harmleſs ſilly Soul. As ſoon as he enter'd the Room, Which is my Lord Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, quoth he? Who but he that ſits in the Chair, anſwer'd the Secretary! I humble my ſelf to his Worſhip's Preſence, quoth the Fellow; and with that, falling on his Knees, begg'd to kiſs his Hand: Which <hi>Sancho</hi> refus'd; but bid him riſe, and tell him what he had to ſay. The Country-man then got up, my Lord, quoth he, I am a Husband-man of <hi>Miguel-Turra,</hi> a Town ſome two Leagues from <hi>Ciudad-real.</hi> Here's another <hi>Tirte a fuera,</hi> quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> Well, go on Friend; I know the Place full well; 'tis not far from our Town. An't pleaſe you, ſaid the Country-man, my Buſineſs is this. I was marry'd, by Heaven's Mercy, in the Face of our Holy Mother the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Church; and I have two Boys that take their Learning at the College; the youngeſt ſtudies to become a Batchelor, and the eldeſt to be a Maſter of Arts. I am a Widower, becauſe my Wife is dead; ſhe dy'd, an't pleaſe you, or to ſpeak more truly, ſhe was kill'd, as a Body may ſay, by a damn'd Doctor, that gave her a Purge when ſhe was with Child. Had it been Heaven's bleſſed Will that ſhe had been brought to Bed of a Boy, I would have ſent him to ſtudy to have been a Doctor, that he might have had no Cauſe to envy his Brothers. So then, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> had not your Wife died, or had they not made her die, you had not been a Widower. Very true, anſwer'd the Man. We are much the nearer, cry'd <hi>Sancho;</hi> Go on, honeſt Friend, and prithee diſpatch; for 'tis rather Time to take an Afternoons-Nap than to talk of Buſineſs. Now, Sir, I muſt tell you, continu'd the Farmer, that that Son of mine the Batchelor of Art that is to be, fell in Love with a Maiden of our
<pb n="1071" facs="tcp:54446:579"/>
Town, <hi>Clara Perlerina</hi> by Name, the Daughter of <hi>Andrew Perlerino,</hi> a mighty rich Farmer; and <hi>Perlerino</hi> is not their right Name neither; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the whole Generation of 'em is troubl'd with the Palſie, they us'd to be call'd from the Name of that Ailing, <hi>Perlaticos,</hi> but now they go by that of <hi>Perlerino;</hi> and truly it fits the young Woman rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for ſhe is a precius Pearl for Beauty, eſpecially if you ſtand on her right Side and view her; ſhe looks like a Flower in the Fields On the left in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſhe does not look altogether ſo well; for there ſhe wants an Eye, which ſhe loſt by the Small-Pox, that has digg'd a many Pits ſomewhat deep all over her Face; but thoſe that wiſh her well ſay, that's nothing, and that thoſe Pits are but ſo many Graves to bury Lovers Hearts in. She is ſo clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that becauſe ſhe will not have her Noſe drop upon her Lips, ſhe carries it cock'd up, and her Noſtrils are turn'd up on each Side, as if they ſhunn'd her Mouth, that is ſomewhat of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, and for all that ſhe looks exceeding well; and were it not for ſome ten or dozen of her Butter Teeth and Grinders which ſhe wants, ſhe might ſet up for one of the clevereſt Laſſes in the Country. As for her Lips, I don't know what to ſay of 'em, for they are ſo thin and ſo ſlender, that were it the Faſhion to wind Lips as they do Silk, one might make a Skain of hers. Beſides, they are not of the ordinary Hue of common Lips: No, they are of the moſt wonderful Colour that ever was ſeen, as being ſpeckled with Blue, Green, and Orange-Tawny. I hope my Lord Governour will pardon me, for dwelling thus on the Picture and ſeveral rare Features of her that is one Day to be my Daughter, ſeeing 'tis meerly out of my hearty Love and Affection for the Girl. Prithee paint on as long as thou wilt, ſaid <hi>Sancho;</hi> I am mightily taken with this kind of Painting, and if I had but
<pb n="1072" facs="tcp:54446:580"/>
din'd, I would not deſire a better Deſert than thy Original. Both my ſelf and that are at your Service, quoth the Fellow, or at leaſt, we may be in time, if we are not now. But alaſs! Sir, that is nothing; could I ſet before your Eyes her pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Carriage, and her Shape, you would admire. But that's not to be done; for ſhe is ſo crooked and crumpl'd up together, that her Knees and her Chin meet, and yet any one may perceive that if ſhe could but ſtand upright, her Head wou'd touch the very Cieling; and ſhe would have given her Hand to my Son the Batchelor in the Way of Matrimony before now, but that ſhe's not able to ſtretch it forth, the Sinews being quite ſhrunk up: However the broad long-gutter'd Nails add no ſmall Grace to it, and may let you know what a well-made Hand ſhe has.</p>
                        <p>So far, ſo good, ſaid <hi>Sancho;</hi> but let us ſuppoſe you have drawn her from Head to Foot. What is it you'd be at now? Come to the Point, Friend, without ſo many Windings and Turnings, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round about the Buſh. Sir, ſaid the Farmer, I would deſire your Honour to do me the Kindneſs to give me a Letter of Accomodation to the Father of my Daughter-in-Law, beſeeching him to be pleas'd to let the Marriage be fulfill'd; ſeeing we are not unlike, neither in Eſtate nor in bodily Concerns. For to tell you the Truth, my Lord Governour, my Son is bewitch'd, and there is not a Day paſſes over his Head but the foul Fiends torment him three or four Times; and having once had the ill Luck to fall into the Fire, the Skin of his Face is ſhrivell'd up like a Piece of Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and his Eyes are ſomewhat ſore and full of Rheum. But when all is ſaid, he has the Temper of an Angel, and were he not apt to thump and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labour
<pb n="1073" facs="tcp:54446:580"/>
himſelf now and then in his Fits, you would take him to be a Saint.</p>
                        <p>Have you any Thing elſe to ask, honeſt Man, ſaid <hi>Sancho?</hi> Only one Thing more, quoth the Farmer; but I am ſomewhat afraid to ſpeak it. Yet I cannot find in my Heart to let it rot within me, and therefore, fall Back fall Edge, I muſt out with it. I would deſire your Worſhip to beſtow on me ſome three hundred or ſix hundred Ducats towards my Batchelor's Portion, I mean to help him to begin the World, and furniſh him a Houſe; for, in ſhort, they will live by themſelves, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubject to the Impertinencies of a Father-in-Law. Well, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſee if you would have any Thing elſe; if you would, don't let Fear or Baſhful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be your Hinderance! Out with it Man. No truly, quoth the Farmer; and he had hardly ſpoke the Words, when the Governour ſtarting up, and laying hold of his Chair. You brazen-fac'd ſilly impudent Country-Booby, cry'd he, get out of my Preſence this Moment, or, by the Blood of the <hi>Pança</hi>'s, I'll crack your Jolter-head with this Chair, you whoreſon Raggamuffin, Painter for the Devil. Doſt thou come at this Time of Day to ask me for ſix hundred Ducats? Where ſhould I have 'em, mangy Clod-pate? And if I had 'em, why ſhould I give 'em thee, thou old doating Scoundrel? What pox care I for <hi>Miguel Turra,</hi> or all the Generation of the <hi>Perlerinos.</hi> Avoid the Room, I ſay, or by the Life of the Duke, I'll be as good as my Word; and ding out thy Cookoo-Brains.

No, thou only Miſtreſs of my Soul, whether transform'd into a rank Country Wench, or into one of the Nymphs of the golden <hi>Tagus,</hi> that weave Silk and Gold in the Loom: Whether <hi>Merlin</hi> or <hi>Monteſinos</hi> detain thee where they pleaſe, be where thou wilt, thou ſtill art mine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and wherever I ſhall be, I muſt and will be thine. Juſt as he ended his Speech, the Door open'd. Up he got in the Bed, wrapp'd from Head to Foot in a Yellow Sattin Quilt, with a Woollen Cap on his Head, his Face and his Muſtachio's bound up; his Face, to heal its Scratches, and his Muſtachio's, to keep them from hanging down: In which Poſture, he look'd like the ſtrangeſt Apparition that can be imagin'd. He fix'd his Eyes towards the Door, and when he expected to have ſeen the yielding and doleful <hi>Altiſidora,</hi> he beheld a moſt Reverend Matron approaching in a White Vail, ſo long that it cover'd her from Head to Foot. Betwixt her Left-hand Fingers ſhe carried half a Candle lighted, and held her Right-hand before her Face to keep the Blaze of the Taper from her Eyes, which were hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by a huge Pair of Spectacles. All the way ſhe trod very ſoftly, and mov'd a very ſlow Pace. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> thus mounted, watch'd her Motions, and obſerving her Garb and her Silence, took her for
<pb n="1076" facs="tcp:54446:582"/>
ſome Witch or Inchantreſs, that came in that Dreſs to practiſe her wicked Sorceries upon him; and began to make the Sign of the Croſs as faſt as he cou'd. The Viſion advanc'd all the while, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing got to the Middle of the Chamber, lifted up its Eyes; and ſaw Don <hi>Quixote</hi> thus making a thouſand Croſſes on his Breaſt. But if he was aſtoniſh'd at ſight of ſuch a Figure, ſhe was no leſs afrighted at his: So that as ſoon as ſhe ſpy'd him thus wrapp'd up in Yellow, ſo lank, be-patch'd, and muffl'd up; Bleſs me, cry'd ſhe, what's this! with the ſudden Fright; ſhe drop'd her Candle, and now being in the Dark, as ſhe was running out, the Length of her Coats made her ſtumble, and down ſhe fell in the Middle of the Chamber, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> at the ſame Time was in great Anxiety. Phantome, cry'd he, or whatever thou art, I conjure thee to tell me who thou art, and what thou requir'ſt of me? If thou art a Soul in Torment, tell me, and I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour thy Eaſe to the utmoſt of my Power; for I am a Catholick Chriſtian, and love to do Good to all Mankind; for which Reaſon I took upon me the Order of Knight-Errantry, whoſe extenſive Duties engage me to relieve the Souls in Purgatory.

Tell me, <hi>Donna Rodriguez,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> are not you come to manage ſome Love-Intrigue? If you are, take it from me, you'll loſe your Labour: Tis all in vain, Thanks to the peerleſs Beauty of my Lady
<pb n="1077" facs="tcp:54446:582"/>
                           <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo.</hi> In a Word, Madam, provided you come not on ſome ſuch Embaſſy, you may go light your Candle, and return, and we will talk of any Thing you pleaſe; but remember I bar all dangerous Inſinuations, all amorous Inticements: What! I procure for others, cry'd the Matron! I find you don't know me, Sir. I am not ſo ſtale yet, to be reduc'd to ſuch poor Employments. I have good Fleſh ſtill about me, Heaven be praiſed, and all my Teeth in my Head, except ſome few which the Rheums, ſo riſe, in this Country of <hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> have robb'd me of. But ſtay a little, I'll go light my Candle, and then I'll tell you my Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, for 'tis you that ſet to rights every thing in the World. This ſaid, away ſhe went, without ſtaying for an Anſwer.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Don Quixote</hi> expected her a While quietly, but his working Brain ſoon ſtarted a thouſand Chimera's concerning this new Adventure; and he fancied he did ill in giving Way, tho' but to a Thought of endangering his Faith to his Miſtreſs. Who knows, ſaid he to himſelf, but that the Devil is now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to circumvent me with an old Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nante, tho' it has not heen in his Power to do it with Counteſſes, Marchioneſſes, Dutcheſſes, Queens, nor Empreſſes. I have often heard ſay, and that by Perſons of great Judgment, that, if he can, he will rather delude a Man with an ugly Object, than with one that's Beautiful. Who knows but this Solitude, this Occaſion, the Stillneſs of the Night, may rouze my ſleeping Deſires, and cauſe me in my latter Age to fall, where I never ſtumbl'd before? In ſuch Caſes 'tis better to fly, than to ſtay to face the Danger. But why do I argue ſo fooliſhly? Sure 'tis impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that an antiquated Waiting-Matron, in a long White Vail, like a Winding-ſheet, with a Pair of Spectacles over her Noſe, ſhould create or waken
<pb n="1078" facs="tcp:54446:583"/>
an unchaſte Thought in the moſt abandon'd Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine in the World. Is there any of theſe <hi>Duena's</hi> or Governante's that has good Fleſh? Is there one of thoſe Implements of Antichambers that is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, affected, and intolerable? Avaunt then, all ye idle Croud of wrinkl'd Female-Waiters, unfit for any humane Recreation! How is that Lady to be commended, who, they tell us, ſet up only a couple of Mawkins in her Chamber, exactly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting two Waiting-Matrons, with their Work before 'em! The State and Decorum of her Room was as well kept with thoſe Statues as it wou'd have been with real <hi>Duena's.</hi> So ſaying, he ſtarted from the Bed, to lock the Door and ſhut out <hi>Donna Rodri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guez;</hi> but in that very Moment ſhe happen'd to come in with a Wax-Candle lighted; at what Time ſpying the Knight near her, wrapp'd in his Quilt his Face bound up, and a woollen Cap on his Head, ſhe was frighted again, and ſtarted two or three Steps back. Sir Knight, ſaid ſhe, is my Honour ſafe; for I don't think it looks handſomely in you to come out of your Bed? I ought to ask you the ſame Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, Madam, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> and therefore tell me whether I ſhall be ſafe from being aſſaulted and raviſh'd? Whom are you afraid of, Sir Knight, cry'd ſhe? Of you, reply'd Don <hi>Quixote:</hi> for, in ſhort, I am not made of Marble, nor you of Braſs; neither is it now the Noon of Day, but that of Night, and a little later too, if I am not miſtaken; beſides we are in a Place, more cloſe and private than the Cave muſt have been, where the falſe and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous <hi>Aeneas</hi> enjoy'd the beautiful and tender-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Dido.</hi> However, give me your Hand, Madam; for I deſire no greater Security than that of my own Continence and Circumſpection. This ſaid, he kiſs'd his own Right-hand, and with it took hold
<pb n="1079" facs="tcp:54446:583"/>
of hers, which ſhe gave him with the ſame Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
                        <p>Here <hi>Cid Hamet</hi> (making a Parentheſis) ſwears by <hi>Mahomet,</hi> he would have given the beſt Coat of two that he had, only to have ſeen the Knight and the Matron walk thus Hand in Hand from the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-door to the Bed-ſide. To make ſhort, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> went to Bed again, and <hi>Donna Rodriguez</hi> ſate down in a Chair at ſome Diſtance, without taking off her Spectacles, or ſetting down the Candle Don <hi>Quixote</hi> crouded up together, and cover'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf cloſe, all but the Face, and after they had both remain'd a while in Silence, the firſt that broke it was the Knight. Now, Madam, ſaid he, you may freely unburden your Heart, ſure of Attention to your Complaints, from chaſte Ears, and Aſſiſtance in your Diſtreſs from a compaſſionate Heart. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve no leſs, ſaid the Matron, and promis'd my ſelf no leſs charitable an Anſwer from a Perſon of ſo graceful and pleaſing a Preſence. The Caſe then is, Noble Sir, that tho' you ſee me ſitting in this Chair, in the Middle of <hi>Arragon,</hi> in the Habit of an inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant unhappy <hi>Duena,</hi> I am of <hi>Aſturias de Oviedo,</hi> and of one of the beſt Families in that Province. But my hard Fortune, and the Neglect of my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, who fell to Decay, too ſoon, I can't tell how, brought me to <hi>Madrid;</hi> where, becauſe they cou'd do no better, for Fear of the worſt, they plac'd me with a Court-Lady, to be her Chamber-Maid. And tho' I ſay it, for all manner of Plain-Work, I never was outdone by any one in all my Life. My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother left me at Service, and return'd home; and ſome few Years after, they both dy'd, and went to Heaven, I hope; for they were very good and religious Catholicks. Then was I left an Orphan, and wholly reduc'd to the ſorrowful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ſuch Court-Servants, wretched Wages,
<pb n="1080" facs="tcp:54446:584"/>
and a ſlender Allowance. About the ſame time the Gentleman-Uſher fell in Love with me, before I dreamt of any ſuch Thing, Heaven knows. He was ſomewhat ſtricken in Years, had a fine Beard, was a perſonable Man, and what's more, as good a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman as the King; for he was of the Mountains. We did not carry Matters ſo cloſe in our Love, but it came to my Lady's Ears; and ſo to hinder Peoples Tongues, without any more ado, ſhe caus'd us to be marry'd in the Face of our Holy Mother the Catholick Church; which Matrimony produc'd a Daughter, that made an End of my good Fortune, if I had any. Not that I dy'd in Childbed; for I went my full Time, and was ſafely deliver'd; but becauſe my Husband (reſt his Soul) dy'd a while after of a Fright; and had I but Time to tell you how it happen'd, I dare ſay you wou'd wonder. Here ſhe began to weep piteouſly. Good Sir, cry'd ſhe, I muſt beg your Pardon; for I can't contain my ſelf. As often as I think of my poor Husband, I cant forbear ſhedding of Tears. Bleſs me, how he look'd, and with what Statelineſs he would ride, with my Lady behind him, on a ſtout Mule as black as Jet, (for Coaches and Chairs were not us'd then as they are now a-days; but the Ladies rode behind their Gentlemen-Uſhers.) And now my Tongue's in, I can't help telling you the whole Story, that you may ſee what a fine well-bred Man my dear Husband was, and how nice in every Punctilio.</p>
                        <p>One Day, at <hi>Madrid,</hi> as he came into St. <hi>James's-Street,</hi> which is ſomewhat narrow, with my Lady behind him, he met a Judge of the Court, with two Officers before him: Whereupon, as ſoon as he ſaw him, to ſhew his Reſpect, my Husband turn'd about his Mule, as if he deſign'd to have waited on him. But my Lady whiſpering him in the Ear, what d'you mean, ſaid ſhe, Blockhead? Don't you
<pb n="1081" facs="tcp:54446:584"/>
know your Way? The Judge on his ſide was no leſs civil; and ſtopping his Horſe, Sir, ſaid he, pray keep your Way; you muſt not go with me, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes me rather to wait on my Lady <hi>Caſilda,</hi> (for that was the Lady's Name.) However my Husband with his Hat in his Hand, perſiſted in his civil Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But at laſt, my Lady being very angry with him for it, took a great Pin, or rather, as I am apt to believe, a Bodkin out of her Caſe, and run it into his Back; upon which my Husband ſuddenly ſtarting, and crying out, fell out of the Saddle, and pull'd down my Lady after him. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately two of her Footmen ran to help her, and the Judge and his Officers did the like. The Gate of <hi>Guadalajara</hi> was preſently in a Hubbub (the idle People about the Gate I mean.) In ſhort, my Lady return'd home a foot, and my Husband went to a Surgeon, complaining that he was prick'd through the Bowels. And now this Civility of his was talk'd of every where, inſomuch that the very Boys in the Streets flock'd about him; for which Reaſon, and becauſe he was ſomewhat ſhort-ſighted, my Lady diſmiſs'd him her Service; which he took ſo to Heart, poor Man, that I dare ſay it coſt him his Life ſoon after. Now was I left a poor helpleſs Widow, and with a Daughter to keep, who ſtill encreas'd in Beauty as ſhe grew up, like the Foam of the Sea. At length, having the Name of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Work-woman at my Needle, my Lady Dutcheſs, who was newly marry'd to his Grace, took me to live with her here in <hi>Arragon,</hi> and my Daughter as well as my ſelf. In time the Girl grew up, and became the moſt accompliſh'd Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the World. She Sings like a Lark, Dances llke a Fairy, Trips like a wild Buck, Writes and Reads like a School-maſter, and caſts Accompts like an Uſurer. I ſay nothing of her Neatneſs; but
<pb n="1082" facs="tcp:54446:585"/>
certainly the pureſt Spring-water that runs is not more cleanly; and then for her Age, ſhe is now, if I miſtake not, juſt Sixteen Years, Five Months, and Three Days old. Now who ſhou'd happen to fall in Love with this Daughter of mine, but a mighty rich Farmer's Son, that lives in one of my Lord Duke's Villages not far off; and indeed, I can't tell how he manag'd Matters, but he ply'd her ſo cloſe, that upon a Promiſe of Marriage he wheedled her into a Conſent, and, in ſhort, got his Will of her, and now refuſes to make his Word good. The Duke is no ſtranger to the Buſineſs; for I have made my Complaint to him about it many and many times, and begg'd of him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn the Young Man to Wed my Daughter; but he turns his deaf Ear to me, and can't endure I ſhou'd ſpeak to him of it, becauſe the Young Knave's Father is rich, and lends the Duke Money, and is bound for him upon all Occaſions, ſo that he would by no means diſoblige him.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, Sir, I apply my ſelf to your Worſhip, and beſeech you to ſee my Daughter righted, either by Entreaties, or by Force; ſeeing every Body ſays, you were ſent into this World to redreſs Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and aſſiſt thoſe in Adverſity. Be pleas'd to caſt an Eye of Pity on my Daughter's Orphan-ſtate, her Beauty, her Youth, and all her other good Parts; for, o' my Conſcience, of all the Damſels my Lady has, there is not one can come up to her by a Mile; no, not ſhe that's cry'd up as the airieſt and fineſt of 'em all, whom they call <hi>Altiſidora:</hi> I am ſure ſhe is not to be nam'd the ſame Day: For, let me tell you, Sir, all is not Gold that gliſters: This ſame <hi>Altiſidora</hi> after all, is a hoity toity, that has more Vanity than Beauty, and leſs Modeſty than Confidence. Beſides, ſhe is none of the ſoundeſt neither, for her Breath is ſo ſtrong,
<pb n="1083" facs="tcp:54446:585"/>
that no Body can endure to ſtand near her for a Moment. Nay, my Lady Dutcheſs too—but I muſt ſay no more, for as they ſay, Walls have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ars. What of my Lady Dutcheſs, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote?</hi> By all that's dear to you, <hi>Donna Rodriguez,</hi> tell me, I conjure you. Your Entreaties, ſaid the Matron, are too ſtrong a Charm to be reſiſted, dear Sir, and I muſt tell you the Truth. Do you obſerve, Sir, that Beauty of my Lady's; that Soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that Clearneſs of Complexion, ſmooth and ſhining like a poliſh'd Sword. Thoſe Cheeks, all Milk and Vermilion, fair like the Moon, and glorious like the Sun; that Air when ſhe treads, as if ſhe diſdain'd to touch the Ground, and in ſhort, that Look of Health that enlivens all her Charms? Let me tell you, Sir, ſhe may thank Heaven for't in the firſt Place, and next to that, two Iſſues in both her Legs, which ſhe keeps open to carry off the ill Humours of which the Phyſicians ſay her. Body abounds. Bleſs'd Virgin, cry'd Don <hi>Quixote!</hi> Is it poſſible the Dutcheſs ſhou'd have ſuch Drains! I ſhou'd not have believ'd it from any Body but you, though Bare-foot-Friers had ſworn it. But yet certainly from ſo much Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, no ill Humours can flow, but rather Liquid Amber. Well, I am now perſwaded ſuch Sluces may be of Importance to Health.</p>
                        <p>Scarce had Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ſaid thoſe Words, when at one Bounce the Chamber-door ſlew open; whereupon <hi>Donna Rodriguez</hi> was ſeiz'd with ſuch a terrible Fright, that ſhe let fall her Candle, and while they were thus in the Dark, the poor Matron felt ſome Body hold her by the Throat, and ſqueeze her Weaſand ſo hard, that it was not in her Power to cry out. And another having pull'd up her Coats, laid her on ſo unmercifully upon her bare Buttocks with a Slipper or ſome ſuch Thing, that it
<pb n="1084" facs="tcp:54446:586"/>
would have mov'd any one but thoſe that did it, to Pity. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was not without Compaſſion, yet he did not think fit to ſtir from the Bed, but lay ſnug and ſilent all the While, not knowing what the Meaning of this Buſtle might be, fearing leſt the Tempeſt that pour'd on the Matron's Poſteriors might alſo light upon his own; and not without Reaſon; for indeed, after the mute Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioners had well curried the Old Gentlewoman (who durſt not cry out) they came to Don <hi>Quixote</hi> and turning up the Bed-Cloaths, pinch'd him ſo hard and ſo long, that in his own Defence, he cou'd not forbear laying about him with his Fiſts as well as he cou'd, till at laſt, after the Scuffle had laſted about half an Hour, the Inviſible Phantomes vaniſh'd. <hi>Donna Rodriguez</hi> ſet her Coats to rights, and lamenting her hard Fortune, left the Room, without ſpeaking a Word to the Knight. As for him, he remain'd where he was, ſadly pinch'd and tir'd, and very moody and thoughtful, not knowing who this wicked Inchanter ſhou'd be, that had us'd him in that manner. But we ſhall know that in its proper Time. Now let us leave him, and return to <hi>Sancho Pança,</hi> who calls upon us, as the Order of our Hiſtory requires.</p>

                        <p>WE left our mighty Governour much out of Humour, and in a pelting Chafe, with that ſaucy Knave of a Country-man, who, according to the Inſtructions he had receiv'd from the Steward, and the Steward from the Duke, had banter'd his Worſhip with his impertinent Deſcription. Yet as much a Dunce and a Fool as he was, he made his Party good againſt them all. At laſt, addreſſing himſelf to thoſe about him, among whom was Doctor <hi>Pedro Rezio,</hi> who had ventur'd into the Room again after the Conſult about the Duke's Letter was over; Now, ſaid he, do I find in good earneſt that Judges and Governors muſt be made of Braſs, or ought to be made of Braſs, that they may be Proof againſt the Importunities of thoſe that pretend Buſineſs, who at all Hours, and at all Seaſons would be heard and diſpatch'd, without any Regard to any Body but themſelves, let what will come of the reſt, ſo their Turn is ſerv'd. Now if a poor Judge does not hear and diſpatch them preſently, either becauſe he is other ways buſie and cannot, or becauſe they don't come at a proper Seaſon, then do they grumble, and give him their Bleſſing backwards, rake up the Aſhes of his Fore-Fathers, and would gnaw his very Bones. But with your Leave, good, Mr. Buſy-body, with all your Buſineſs you are too haſty, pray have a little
<pb n="1086" facs="tcp:54446:587"/>
Patience, and wait a fit Time to make your Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. Don't come at Dinner-time, or when a Man is going to Sleep, for we Judges are Fleſh and Blood, and muſt allow Nature what ſhe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally requires; unleſs it be poor I, who am not to allow mine any Food, thanks to my Friend, Maſter Doctor <hi>Pedro Rezio Tirteafuera</hi> here preſent, who is for ſtarving me to Death, and then ſwears 'tis for the Preſervation of my Life.

                        <p>All that knew <hi>Sancho</hi> wonder'd to hear him talk ſo ſenſibly, and began to think that Offices and Places of Truſt inſpir'd ſome Men with Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, as they ſtupify'd and confounded others. However, Doctor <hi>Pedro Rezio aguero de Tirteafuera</hi> promis'd him he ſhould ſup that Night, though he treſpaſs'd againſt all the Aphoriſms of <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> This pacify'd the Governor for the preſent, and made him wait with a mighty Impatience for the Evening, and Supper. To his thinking the Hour was ſo long a coming, that he fancy'd Time ſtood ſtill but yet at laſt the wiſh'd for Moment came, and they ſerv'd him up ſome minc'd Beef with Onions, and ſome Calves-feet ſomewhat ſtale. The hungry Governour preſently fell to with more Eagerneſs and Appetite than if they had given him <hi>Milan</hi> God wits, <hi>Roman</hi> Pheaſants, <hi>Sorrentum</hi> Veal, <hi>Moron</hi> Partridges, or <hi>Lavajos</hi> Goſlins. And after he had pretty well taken off the ſharp Edge of his Stomach, turning to the Phyſician, Look you, quoth he, Mr. Doctor, hereafter never trouble your ſelf to get me Dainties or Tit-bits to humour my Stomach; that would but take it quite off the Hinges; by Reaſon it has been us'd to nothing but good Beef, Bacon, Pork, Goats-fleſh, Turnips

and Onions; and if you ply me with your Kick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaws, your nice Courtiers Fare, 'twill but make my Stomach ſqueamiſh and untoward, and I ſhould perfectly loath them one time or other.

But let no Body put Tricks upon Travellers, and make a Fool of me; for either we are, or we are not. Let's be Merry and Wiſe, when God ſends his Light he ſends it to all, I'll govern this Iſland fair and ſquare, without Underhand-dealings or taking of Bribes; but take notice, I won't bate an Inch of my Right; and therefore let every one carry an even Hand, and mind their Hits, or elſe I'd have them to know there's Rods in Piſs for 'em. They that urge me too far ſhall rue for it; make your ſelf Honey, and the Flies will eat you. Indeed, my Lord Governour, ſaid the Steward, your Lordſhip is much in the right in all you have ſaid; and I dare engage for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of this Iſland, that they will obey and obſerve your Commands with Diligence, Love, and Punctuality; for your gentle Way of Governing in the Beginning of your Adminiſtration does not give them the leaſt Opportunity to act, or but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign any Thing to your Lordſhip's Diſadvantage. I believe as much, anſwer'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> and they would be ſilly Wretches, ſhould they offer to do or think otherwiſe. Let me tell you too, 'tis my Pleaſure you take care of me and my <hi>Dapple,</hi> that we may both have our Food as we ought, which is the moſt

Next, let us think of going the Rounds, when 'tis time for me to do it; for I intend to clear this Iſland of all Filth and Rubbiſh, of all Rogues and Vagrants, idle Lusks and ſturdy Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. For I would have you to know, my good Friends, that your ſlothful, lazy, lewd People in a Commonwealth are like Drones in a Bee-hive, that waſte and devour the Honey which the labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bees gather. I deſign to encourage Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, preſerve the Privileges of the Gentry, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vertuous Perſons, and above all Things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence Religion, and have regard to the Honour Religious Men. What think you of this my good Friends? do I talk to the Purpoſe, or do I talk idly? You ſpeak ſo well, my Lord Governour, anſwer'd the Steward, that I ſtand in Admiration to hear a Man ſo unletter'd as you are (for I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve your Lordſhip can't read at all) utter ſo many notable Things, and in every Word a Sentence; far from what they who ſent you hither, and they who are here preſent, ever expected from your Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.

                        <p>It being now Night, and the Governour having ſupp'd, with Doctor <hi>Rezio</hi>'s Leave, he prepar'd to walk the Rounds, and ſet forward, attended by the Steward; the Secretary, the Gentleman-Waiter, the Hiſtoriographer who was to regiſter his Acts, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Sergeants and other Limbs of the Law, ſo many in Number that they made a little Battalion, in the Middle of which the great <hi>Sancho</hi> march'd with his Rod of Juſtice in his Hand, in a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table manner.

Do they ſuffer Folks to be robb'd in this Town in Defiance to Heaven and the King? Do they let Men be ſtripp'd in the Middle of the Street? Hold, honeſt Man, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> have a little Patience, and let me know the Occaſion of this Fray, for I am the Governor. My Lord, ſaid the other Party, I'll tell you in few Words. Your Lordſhip muſt know that this Gentleman, juſt now, at a Gaming Ordinary over the Way, won above a thouſand Reals, Heaven knows how. I ſtood by all the while, and gave Judgment for him in more than one doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Caſt, tho' I could not well tell how to do it in Conſcience. He carried off his Winnings, and when I expected he would have given me a Piece or Two, as it is a Claim among Gentlemen of my Faſhion, who frequent Ordinaries, from thoſe that play high and win, for preventing Quarrels, being at their <hi>Bac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I ran after him, not very well pleaſed with his Proceeding, yet very civilly deſir'd him to conſider I was his Friend, that he knew me to be a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, though fallen to Decay, that had nothing to live upon, my Friends having brought me up to no Employment; and therefore I entreated him to be ſo kind as to give me eight Reals: But the ſtingy Soul, a greater Thief than <hi>Cacus,</hi> and a worſe Sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than <hi>Andradilla,</hi> would give me but ſneaking four Reals. And now, my Lord, you may ſee how little Shame and Conſcience there's in him. But Faith, had not your Lordſhip come juſt in the Nick, I would have made him bring up his Winnings, and taught him the Difference between a Rook and a Jack-daw. What ſay you to this, cry'd <hi>Sancho</hi> to
<pb n="1090" facs="tcp:54446:589"/>
the other? The other made Anſwer, that he could not deny what his Antagoniſt had ſaid, that he would give him but four Reals, becauſe he had giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en him Money ſeveral Times before; and Beggers ſhould not be Chuſers, but be thankful for what is given them, without haggling with thoſe that have won, unleſs they know 'em to be common Cheats, and the Money not won fairly; and that to ſhew he was a fair Gameſter, and no Sharper, as the other ſaid, there needed no better Proof than his Refuſal to give him any Thing, ſince the Sharpers are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in Fee with theſe Bully-Rooks who know 'em, and wink at their Cheats. That's true, ſaid the Steward: Now what would your Lordſhip have us to do with theſe Men? I'll tell you, ſaid <hi>Sancho.</hi> Firſt, you that are the Winner, whether by fair Play or by foul, give your Bully-hack here a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Reals, immediately, and thirty more for the poor Priſoners: And you that have nothing to live on, and were brought up to no Employment, and go ſharping up and down from Place to Place, pray take your hundred Reals, and be ſure by to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to go out of this Iſland, and not to ſet Foot in it again theſe Ten Years and a Day, unleſs you have a Mind to make an End of your Baniſhment in another World; for if I find you here I will make you ſwing on a Gibbet, with the Help of the Hangman; away, and let no Body offer to reply, or I'll lay him by the Heels. Thereupon the one disburs'd, and the other receiv'd, the firſt went Home, and the laſt went out of the Iſland; and then the Governour going on, either I ſhall want of my Will, ſaid he, or I'll put down theſe diſorderly Gaming-Houſes; for I have a Fancy they are highly prejudicial. As for this Houſe in Queſtion, ſaid one of the Officers, I ſuppoſe it will be a hard Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to put it down, for it belongs to a Perſon of
<pb n="1091" facs="tcp:54446:589"/>
Quality, who loſes a great deal more by Play at the Year's End than he gets by his Cards. You may ſhew your Authority againſt other gaming Houſes of leſs Note, that do more Miſchief, and harbour more dangerous People than the Houſes of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Perſons of Quality, where your notorious Sharpers dare not uſe their Slights of Hand. And ſince Gaming is a Vice that is become a common Practice, 'tis better to play in good Gentlemens Houſes, than in thoſe of under Officers, where they ſhall draw you in a poor Bubble, and after they have kept him playing all the Night long, ſend him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſtripp'd naked to the Skin. Well, all in good Time, ſaid <hi>Sancho:</hi> I know there's a great deal to be ſaid in this Matter. At the ſame Time one of the Officers came holding a Youth, and having brought him before the Governor, an't Pleaſe your Worſhip, ſaid he, this young Man was coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, but aſſoon as he perceiv'd it was the Rounds he ſheer'd off, and ſet a running as faſt as his Legs would carry him, a Sign he's no better than he ſhould be. I ran after him, but had not he happen'd to fall, I had never come up with him. What made you run away, Friend, ſaid <hi>Sancho?</hi> Sir, anſwer'd the young Man, 'twas only to avoid all the Queſtions one is commonly teiz'd with by the Watch. What Buſineſs d'you follow, ask'd <hi>Sancho?</hi> I am a Weaver by Trade anſwer'd the other. A Weaver of what, ask'd the Governor? of Steel Heads for Lances, with your Worſhip's good Leave, ſaid t'other. Oh hoh, cry'd <hi>Sancho</hi> you are an arch Wag I find, and pretend to paſs your Jeſts upon us: Very well. And pray whither are you going at this Time of Night? To take the Air, an't like your Worſhip, anſwer'd the other. Good, ſaid <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> and where do they take the Air in this Iſland? Where it blows, ſaid the Youth. A very proper
<pb n="1092" facs="tcp:54446:590"/>
Anſwer, cry'd <hi>Sancho.</hi> You are a very pretty im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent Fellow, that's the Truth on't. But pray make Account that I am the Air, or the Wind, which you pleaſe, and that I blow in your Poop, and drive you to the Round-houſe.—Here—take him, and carry him away thither to rights: I'll take Care the Youngſter ſhall ſleep out of the Air to Night; he might catch Cold elſe by lying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. Before <hi>George,</hi> ſaid the Young-man, you ſhall aſſoon make me a King as make me ſleep out of the Air to Night. Why, you young Slip-ſtring, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> is it not in my Power to commit thee to Priſon, and fetch thee out again as often as 'tis my Will and Pleaſure? For all your Power, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd the Fellow, you ſhan't make me ſleep in Priſon. Say you ſo, cry'd <hi>Sancho?</hi> Here, away with him to Priſon, and let him ſee to his Coſt who is miſtaken, he or I; and leſt the Jaylor ſhould be greas'd in the Fiſt to let him out, I'll fine him Two Thouſand Ducats if he let thee ſtir a Foot out of Priſon. All that's a Jeſt ſaid the other; for I defy all Mankind to make me ſleep this Night in a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Tell me, Devil incarnate, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> haſt thou ſome Angel to take off the Irons I'll have thee clapp'd in, and get thee out? Well, now, my good Lord Governor (ſaid the young Man very prettily) let us talk Reaſon and come to the Point. Suppoſe your Lordſhip ſhould ſend me to Jail, and get me laid by the Heels in the Dungeon, ſhackl'd and manacl'd, and lay a heavy Penalty on the Jaylor in Caſe he let me out; and ſuppoſe your Orders be ſtrictly obey'd; yet for all that, if I have no Mind to Sleep, but will keep awake all Night without ſo much as ſhutting my Eyes, pray can you, with all the Power you have, make me ſleep whether I will or no? No certainly, ſaid the Secretary, and the young Man has made out his Meaning. Well, ſaid
<pb n="1093" facs="tcp:54446:590"/>
                           <hi>Sancho,</hi> but I hope you mean to keep your ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, only as one would chuſe to ſleep if he liſts himſelf, and not to thwart my Will. I mean no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe indeed, my Lord, ſaid the Lad. Why then go Home and ſleep, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> and Heaven ſend thee good Reſt. I'll not be thy Hind'rance. But have a Care mother Time of ſporting with Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; for you may meet with ſome Man in an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice that may Chance to break your Head while you are breaking your Jeſt. The Youth went his Way, and the Governor continu'd his Rounds.</p>
                        <p>A while after came two of the Officers, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Perſon along with them. My Lord Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, ſaid one of 'em, we have brought here one that's dreſs'd like a Man, yet is no Man, but a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, and no ugly one neither. Thereupon they lifted up to her Eyes two or three Lanthorns, and by their Light diſcovered the Face of a Woman about Sixteen Years of Age, beautiful to Admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with her Hair put up in a Net-work Cawle of Gold and green Silk. They examin'd her Dreſs from Head to Foot, and found that her Stockings were of Carnation-Silk, and her Garters of white Taffeta, fring'd with Gold and Pearls. Her Bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were of Gold Tiſſue, upon a green Ground, and her Coat of the ſame Stuff; under which ſhe wore a Doublet of very fine Stuff gold and white. Her Shoes were white, and made like Mens. She had no Sword, but only a very rich Dagger, and ſeveral coſtly Rings on her Fingers. In a Word, the young Creature ſeem'd very lovely to 'em all, but not one of 'em knew her. Thoſe of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany who liv'd in the Town could not imagine who ſhe was; and thoſe who were privy to all the Tricks that were to be put upon <hi>Sancho,</hi> were more at a loſs than the reſt, well knowing that this Adventure was not of their own contriving; which
<pb n="1094" facs="tcp:54446:591"/>
made 'em be in great Expectation of the Event. <hi>Sancho</hi> was ſurpriz'd at her Beauty, and ask'd her who ſhe was, whither ſhe was going, and upon what Account ſhe had put on ſuch a Dreſs? Sir, ſaid ſhe, (fixing her Eyes on the Ground with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Baſhfulneſs) I can't tell you before ſo many People what I have ſo much Reaſon to wiſh may be kept ſecret. Only this one Thing I do aſſure you, I am no Thief, nor evil-minded Perſon; but an unhappy Maid, whom the Force of Jealouſie has conſtrain'd to tranſgreſs the Laws of Maiden De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. The Steward hearing this, My Lord Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, ſaid he, be pleas'd to order your Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants to retire, that the Gentlewoman may more freely tell her Mind. The Governor did accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and all the Company remov'd at a Diſtance, except the Steward, the Gentleman-waiter, and the Secretary; and then the young Lady thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.</p>
                        <p>I am the Daughter of <hi>Pedro Perez Mazorca,</hi> Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of the Wool in this Town, who comes very often to my Father's Houſe. This will hardly paſs, Madam, ſaid the Steward; for I know <hi>Pedro Perez</hi> very well, and I am ſure he has neither Sons nor Daughters: Beſides, you tell us he's your Father, and at the ſame Time that he comes very often to your Father's Houſe. I obſerv'd as much, ſaid <hi>Sancho.</hi> Indeed, Gentlemen, ſaid ſhe, I am now ſo troubl'd in Mind, that I know not what I ſay. But the Truth is, I am the Daughter of <hi>Diego de la Llana,</hi> whom I ſuppoſe you all know. Now this may paſs, ſaid the Steward, for I know <hi>Diego de la Llana,</hi> who is a very conſiderable Gentleman, has a good Eſtate, and a Son and a Daughter. But ſince his Wife dy'd, no Body in this Town can ſay he ever ſaw that Daughter, for he keeps her ſo cloſe that he hardly ſuffers the Sun to look on her;
<pb n="1095" facs="tcp:54446:591"/>
though indeed the common Report is, that ſhe is an extraordinary Beauty. You ſay very true, Sir, reply'd the young Lady; and I am that very Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; as for my Beauty, if Fame has given a wrong Character of it, you will now be undeceiv'd, ſince you have ſeen my Face; and with this ſhe burſt out into Tears. The Secretary perceiving this, whiſper'd the Gentleman-Waiter in the Ear: Sure, ſaid he, ſome extraordinary Matter muſt have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to this poor young Lady, ſince it could oblige one of her Quality to come out of Doors in this Diſguiſe, and at this unſeaſonable Hour. That's without Queſtion, anſwer'd the other; for her Tears too confirm the Suſpicion. <hi>Sancho</hi> comforted her with the beſt Reaſons he could think on; and bid her not be afraid, but tell 'em what had befall'n her, for they would all really do whatever lay in their Powers to make her eaſie.</p>
                        <p>You muſt know, Gentlemen, ſaid ſhe, that 'tis now Ten Years that my Father has kept me cloſe, ever ſince my Mother dy'd. We have a ſmall Chappel richly adorn'd, in the Houſe, where we hear Maſs; and in all that Time I have ſeen no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Sun by Day, and the Moon and Stars by Night; neither do I know what Streets, Squares, Market-places and Churches are; no nor Men, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept my Father, my Brother, and that <hi>Pedro Perez</hi> the Wool-Farmer, whom I at firſt would have paſs'd upon you for my Father, that I might conceal the right. This Confinement (not being allow'd to ſtir abroad, though but to go to Church) has made me uneaſie this great While, and made me long to ſee the World, or at leaſt the Town where I was born, which I thought was no unlawful or unſeemly Deſire. When I heard 'em talk of Bull-Feaſts, Prizes, acting of Plays, and other publick Sports, I ask'd my Brother, who is a Year younger
<pb n="1096" facs="tcp:54446:592"/>
than I, what they meant by thoſe Things, and a World of others, which I have not ſeen; and he inform'd me as well as he could: But that made me but the more eager to be ſatisfy'd by my own Eyes. In ſhort, I begg'd of my Brother—I wiſh I never had done it—and here ſhe relaps'd into Tears. The Steward perceiving it, come, Madam, ſaid he, pray proceed, and make an End of telling us what has happen'd to you; for your Words and your Tears keep us all in Suſpence. I have but few Words more to add, anſwer'd ſhe, but many more Tears to ſhed; for they are commonly the Fruit of ſuch imprudent Deſires.</p>
                        <p>That Gentleman of the Duke's, who acted the Part of <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Sewer, or Gentleman-Waiter, and was ſmitten with the young Lady's Charms, could not forbear lifting up his Lanthorn to get another Look; and as he view'd her with a Lover's Eyes, the Tears that trickl'd down her Cheeks ſeem'd to him ſo many Pearls, or ſome of the heavenly Dew on a fair drooping Flower, precious as oriental Gems. This made him wiſh that the Misfortune might not be ſo great as her Sighs and Tears be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoke it. As for the Governor, he ſtood fretting to hear her hang ſo long upon her Story; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bid her make an End, and keep 'em no longer thus, for it was late; and they had a great deal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> of Ground to walk over yet. Thereupon with broken Sobs and half-fetch'd Sighs, Sir, ſaid ſhe, all my Misfortune is, that I deſir'd my Brother to lend me ſome of his Cloaths, and that he would take me out ſome Night or other to ſee all the Town, while our Father was aſleep. Importun'd by my Intreaties, he conſented, and having lent me his Cloaths, he put on mine, which fit him as if they had been made for him; for he has no Beard at all, and makes a mighty handſome Woman. So this very
<pb n="1097" facs="tcp:54446:592"/>
Night, about an Hour ago, we got out, and being guided by my Father's Foot-boy and our own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Deſires, we took a Ramble over the whole Town; and as we were going Home, we perceiv'd a great Number of People coming our Way; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, ſaid my Brother, Siſter, this is certainly the Watch; follow me, and let us not only run, but fly as faſt as we can, for if we ſhould be known, 'twould be the worſe for us. With that he fell a Running as faſt as if he had Wings to his Feet. I fell a running too, but was ſo frighted that I fell down before I had gone half a Dozen Steps; and then a Man overtook me, and brought me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, and this Croud of People, by whom, to my Shame, I am taken for an ill'Creature; a bold indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcreet Night-walker. And has nothing befall'n you but this, cry'd <hi>Sancho?</hi> You talk'd at firſt of ſome Jealouſie that had ſet you a gadding. Nothing elſe indeed, anſwer'd the Damſel; though I pretended Jealouſie; I ventur'd out on no other Account but a little to ſee the World, and that too no further than the Streets of this Town. All this was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards confirm'd by her Brother, who now was brought by ſome of the Watch, one of whom had at laſt overtaken him, after he had left his Siſter. He had nothing on but a very rich Petticoat, and a blue Damask Manteau, with a gold Galloon; his Head without any Ornament but his own Hair, that hung down in natural Curls like ſo many Rings of Gold. The Governor, the Steward, and the Gentleman-waiter took him aſide, and after they had examined him a-part, why he had put on that Dreſs, he gave the ſame Anſwer his Siſter had done, and with no leſs Baſhfulneſs and Concern, much to the Satisfaction of the Gentleman-waiter, who was much ſmitten with the young Lady's Charms.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="1098" facs="tcp:54446:593"/>As for the Governor, after he had heard the whole Matter, Truly, Gentlefolks, ſaid he, here's a little Piece of childiſh Folly. And to give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this wild Frolick, and Slip of Youth, there needed not all theſe Sighs and Tears, nor theſe Hems and Haugh's, and long Excuſes. Could not you without any more ado, as well have ſaid, our Names are ſo and ſo, and we ſtole out of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Houſe for an Hour or Two only, to ramble about the Town, and ſatisfy a little Curioſity, and there had been an End of the Story, without all this Weeping and Wailing? You ſay very well, ſaid the young Damſel, but you may imagine that in the Trouble and Fright I was in, I could not behave my ſelf as I ſhould have done. Well, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> there's no Harm done; go along with us, and we'll ſee you home to your Father's, perhaps you mayn't yet be miſs'd. But have a Care how you gad A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad to ſee Faſhions another Time. Don't be too ventureſome. An honeſt Maid ſhould be ſtill at Home, as if ſhe had one Leg broken. A Hen and a Woman are loſt by Rambling; and ſhe that longs to ſee, longs alſo to be ſeen. I need ſay no more.</p>
                        <p>The young Gentleman thank'd the Governor for his Civility, and then went Home under his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. Being come to the Houſe, the young Spark threw a little Stone againſt one of the Iron-barr'd Windows; and preſently a Maid-Servant who ſate up for 'em came down, open'd the Door, and let him and his Siſter in.</p>
                        <p>The Governour with his Company then, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd his Rounds, talking all the Way they went of the genteel Carriage and Beauty of the Brother and Siſter, and the great Deſire theſe poor Children had to ſee the World by Night.</p>
                        <p>As for the Gentleman-waiter, he was ſo paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately in Love, that he reſolv'd to go the next Day,

and demand her of her Father in Marriage, not doubting but the old Gentleman would comply with him, as he was one of the Duke's principal Servants. On the other Side, <hi>Sancho</hi> had a great Mind to ſtrike a Match between the young Man and his Daughter <hi>Sanchica;</hi> and he reſolved to bring it about as ſoon as poſſible; believing no Man's Son could think himſelf too good for a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor's Daughter. At laſt his Round ended for that Night, and his Government two or three Days after, which alſo put an End to all his great Deſigns and Expectations, as ſhall be ſeen here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>

                           <hi>CID Hamet,</hi> the moſt punctual Enquirer into the minuteſt Particles of this Authentick Hiſtory, relates, that when <hi>Donna Rodriguez</hi> was going out of her Chamber to <hi>Don Quixote</hi>'s Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, another old Waiting-woman that lay with her perceiv'd it: And as one of the chief Pleaſures of all thoſe female Implements conſiſts in enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, prying, and running their Noſes into every Thing, ſhe preſently watch'd her Fellow-Servant's Motions, and follow'd her ſo cautiouſly, that the
<pb n="1100" facs="tcp:54446:594"/>
good Woman did not diſcover it. Now <hi>Donna Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driguez</hi> was no ſooner got into the Knight's Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but the other, leſt ſhe ſhou'd forfeit her Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracter of a true tattling Waiting-woman, flew to tell the Dutcheſs in her Ear, that <hi>Donna Rodriguez</hi> was in <hi>Don Quixote</hi>'s Chamber. The Dutcheſs told the Duke, and having got his Leave to take <hi>Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidora</hi> with her, and go to ſatisfie her Curioſity about this Night-Viſit, they very ſilently crept along in the Dark, till they came to <hi>Don Quixote</hi>'s Door, and as they ſtood liſtening there, overheard very eaſily every Word they ſaid within. So that when the Dutcheſs heard her leaky Woman ſet the Secret of her Imperfection adrift, ſhe was not able to contain, nor was <hi>Altiſidora</hi> leſs provok'd. Full of Rage, and greedy of Revenge, they ruſh'd into the Chamber, and beat the <hi>Duena,</hi> and claw'd the Knight, as has been related. For thoſe affronting Expreſſions that are levell'd againſt the Beauty of Women, or the good Opinion of themſelves, raiſe their Anger and Indignation to the higheſt Degree, and incenſe them to a Deſire of Revenge.</p>
                        <p>The Dutcheſs diverted the Duke with an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what had paſs'd, and having a mighty Mind to continue the Merriment which <hi>Don Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote</hi>'s Extravagancies afforded 'em, the Page that acted the Part of <hi>Dulcinea</hi> when 'twas propos'd to end her Inchantment, was diſpatch'd away to <hi>Tereſa Panſa,</hi> with a Letter from her Husband, (for <hi>Sancho,</hi> having his Head full of his Government, had quite forgot to do it) and at the ſame time the Dutcheſs ſent another from herſelf, with a large coſtly String of Coral, as a Preſent.</p>
                        <p>Now the Story tells us, that the Page was a ſharp and ingenious Lad, and being very deſirous to pleaſe his Lord and Lady, made the beſt of his Way to <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Village. When he came near the Place,
<pb n="1101" facs="tcp:54446:594"/>
he ſaw a Company of Females waſhing at a Brook, and ask'd 'em, whether they cou'd inform him, if there liv'd not in that Town a Woman whoſe Name was <hi>Tereſa Panſa,</hi> Wife to one <hi>Sancho Panſa,</hi> Squire to a Knight call'd Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha?</hi> He had no ſooner ask'd the Queſtion, but a young Wench, that was waſhing among the reſt, ſtood up: That <hi>Tereſa Panſa</hi> is my Mother, quoth ſhe; That Gaffer <hi>Sancho</hi> is my nown Father, and that ſame Knight our Maſter. Well then, Damſel, ſaid the Page, pray go along with me, and bring me to your Mother; for I have a Letter and a Token here for her from your Father. That I will with all my Heart, Sir, ſaid the Girl, who ſeem'd to be about fourteen Years of Age, little more or leſs; and with that leaving the Cloaths ſhe was Waſhing to one of her Companions, without ſtaying to dreſs her Head or put on her Shooes, away ſhe ſprung before the Page's Horſe, bare-legg'd, and with her Hair about her Ears. Come along, an't pleaſe you, quoth ſhe, our Houſe is hard by; 'tis but juſt as you come into the Town, and my Mothers at Home, but brim full of Sorrow, poor Soul, for ſhe has not heard from my Father I don't know how long. Well, ſaid the Page, I bring thoſe Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings that will cheer her Heart, I warrant her. At laſt, what with Leaping, Running, and Jump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Girl being come to the Houſe, Mother, Mother, (cry'd ſhe as loud as ſhe cou'd, before ſhe went in) come out, Mother, come out; here's a Gentleman has brought Letters and Tokens from my Father. At that Summons, out came the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſpinning a Lock of courſe Flax, with a Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet Petticoat about her, ſo ſhort that it look'd as if it had been cut off at the Placket; a Waſtecoat of the ſame, and her Smock hanging looſe about it. Take her otherwiſe, ſhe was none of the oldeſt,
<pb n="1102" facs="tcp:54446:595"/>
but look'd ſomewhat turn'd of Forty, ſtrong built, ſinewy, hale, vigorous and in good Caſe. What's the Matter, Girl (quoth ſhe, ſeeing her Daughter with the Page) What Gentleman is that? A Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of your Ladyſhip's, my Lady <hi>Tereſa Panſa,</hi> anſwer'd the Page; and at the ſame Time aligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and throwing himſelf at her Feet with the moſt humble Submiſſion; My Noble Lady <hi>Donna Tereſa,</hi> ſaid he, permit me the Honour to Kiſs your Ladyſhip's Hand, as you are the only legitimate Wife of my Lord Don <hi>Sancho Panſa,</hi> proper Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Iſland of <hi>Barataria.</hi> Alack a day, good Sir, quoth <hi>Tereſa,</hi> what d'you do? By no Means. I am none of your Court-Dames, but a poor ſilly Country Body, a Plough-man's Daughter, the Wife indeed of a Squire-Errant, but no Governour. Your Ladyſhip, reply'd the Page, is the moſt worthy Wife of a thrice-worthy Governour; and for Proof of what I ſay, be pleas'd to receive this Letter, and this Preſent, with that he took out of his Pocket a String of Coral Beads ſet in Gold, and putting it about her Neck, This Letter, ſaid he, is from his Honour the Governour, and another that I have for you, together with theſe Beads, from her Grace the Lady Dutcheſs, that ſent me to your Ladyſhip.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Tereſa</hi> ſtood amaz'd, and her Daughter was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. Now I'll be hang'd, quoth the young Baggage, if our Maſter, Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> be not at the Bottom of this. Ay, this is his doing. He has given my Father that ſame Government or Earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom he has promis'd him ſo many Times. You ſay right, anſwer'd the Page: 'Tis for the Lord Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s ſake that the Lord <hi>Sancho</hi> is now Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Iſland of <hi>Barataria,</hi> as the Letter will inform you. Good Sir quoth <hi>Tereſa,</hi> read it me, an't like your Worſhip; for tho' I can ſpin, I can't
<pb n="1103" facs="tcp:54446:595"/>
read a Jot: Nor I neither e'fackins, cry'd <hi>Sanchica.</hi> But do but ſtay a little, and I'll go fetch one that ſhall; either the Batchelour <hi>Samſon Carraſco,</hi> or our Parſon himſelf, who'll come with all their Hearts, to hear News of my Father. You may ſpare your ſelf the Trouble, ſaid the Page; for though I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpin, yet I can read; and I'll read it to ye. With that he read the Letter, which is now omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becauſe it has been inſerted before. That done, he pull'd out another from the Dutcheſs, which runs as follows.</p>

                              <p>YOur Husband <hi>Sancho</hi>'s good Parts, his Wit and Honeſty, oblig'd me to deſire the Duke my Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to beſtow on him the Government of one of his Iſlands. I am inform'd he is as ſharp as a Hawk in his Office; for which I am very glad, as well as my Lord Duke, and return Heaven many Thanks, that I have not been deceiv'd in making Choice of him for that Preferment. For you muſt know, <hi>Signiora Tereſa,</hi> 'tis a difficult Thing to meet with a good Governour in this World; and may Heaven make me as good as <hi>Sancho</hi> proves in his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                              <p>I have ſent you, my Dear Friend, a ſtring of Coral Beads, ſet in Gold; I could wiſh they were Oriental Pearls for your Sake; but a ſmall Token may not hinder a great one.

Commend me to your Daughter <hi>Sanchica,</hi> and bid her from me to be in a Readineſs; for I deſign to marry her greatly when ſhe leaſt thinks of it.</p>
                              <p>I underſtand you have fine large Acorns in your Town; pray ſend me a Dozen or two of 'em, I ſhall ſet a greater Value upon 'em, as coming from your Hands. And pray

                        <p>Bleſs me, quoth <hi>Tereſa,</hi> when ſhe had heard the Letter, what a good Lady's this! Not a Bit of Pride in her! Heaven grant me to be buried with ſuch Ladies, and not with ſuch proud Madams as we have in our Town, who, becauſe they are Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folks forſooth, think the Wind muſt not blow upon 'em, but come flaunting to Church, as ſtately as if they were Queens. It ſeems they think it Scorn to look on a poor Country Woman: But look you here's a good Lady, who, tho' ſhe be Dutcheſs, calls me her Friend, and uſes me as if I were as high as her ſelf. Well, may I ſee her as high as the higheſt Steeple in the whole Country! As for the Acorns ſhe writes for, Maſter o' mine, I'll ſend her good Ladyſhip a whole Peck, and ſuch ſwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Acorns, that every Body ſhall come to admire 'em far and near. And now, <hi>Sanchica,</hi> ſee that the Gentleman be made welcome, and want for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Take Care of his Horſe. Run to the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, get ſome Eggs, cut ſome Bacon; he ſhall fare like a Prince: The rare News he has brought us, and his good Looks deſerve no leſs. Mean while I'll among my Neighbours; I can't hold. I muſt run and tell 'em the News; our good Curate too ſhall know it, and Maſter <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Barber; for they have all along been thy Father's Friends. Ay,
<pb n="1105" facs="tcp:54446:596"/>
do, Mother, ſaid the Daughter; but hark you, you muſt give me half the Beads; for I dare ſay the great Lady knows better Things than to give 'em all to you. 'Tis all thy own, Child, cry'd the Mother; but let me wear it a few Days about my Neck; for thou can'ſt not think how it rejoices the very Heart of me. You will rejoice more preſently, ſaid the Page, when you ſee what I have got in my Portmantle; a fine Suit of Green Cloath, which the Governour wore but one Day a Hunting, and has here ſent to my Lady <hi>Sanchica.</hi> Oh the Lord love him, cry'd <hi>Sanchica,</hi> and the fine Gentleman that brings it me.</p>
                        <p>Preſently, away ran <hi>Tereſa</hi> with the Beads about her Neck, and the Letters in her Hand, all the while playing with her Fingers on the Papers, (as if they had been a Timbrel;) and meeting by chance the Curate and the Batchelor <hi>Carraſco,</hi> ſhe fell a dancing and frisking about; Faith and Troth, cry'd ſhe we are all made now. Not one ſmall Body in all our Kindred. We have got a poor Thing call'd a Government. And now let the proudeſt of 'em all toſs up her Noſe at me, and I'll give her as good as ſhe brings, I'll make her know her Diſtance. How now, <hi>Tereſa,</hi> ſaid the Curate? What mad Fit is this? What Papers are thoſe in your Hand? No mad Fit at all, anſwer'd <hi>Tereſa;</hi> but theſe are Letters from Dutcheſſes and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and theſe Beads about my Neck are right Coral, the <hi>Ave-Mary</hi>'s I mean, and the <hi>Pater-Noſters</hi> are of beaten Gold, and here's Madam Governeſs herſelf. Verily, ſaid the Curate, there's no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding you, <hi>Tereſa;</hi> we don't know what you mean. There's that will clear the Riddle, quoth <hi>Tereſa,</hi> and with that ſhe gave 'em the Letters. Thereupon the Curate having read 'em aloud, that <hi>Sampſon Carraſco</hi> might alſo be inform'd, they both
<pb n="1106" facs="tcp:54446:597"/>
ſtood and look'd on one another, and were more at a Loſs than before. The Batchelor ask'd her who brought the Letter? <hi>Tereſa</hi> told them they might go home with her and ſee; 'twas a ſweet handſome young Man, as fine as any Thing; and that he had brought her another Preſent worth twice as much. The Curate took the String of Beads from her Neck, and view'd it ſeveral times over, and ſinding that it was a Thing of Value, he cou'd not conceive the Meaning of all this. By the Habit that I wear, cry'd he, I cannot tell what to think of this Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. In the firſt Place, I am convinc'd theſe Beads are right Coral and Gold; and in the next, here's a Dutcheſs ſends to beg a dozen or two of Acorns. Crack that Nut if you can, ſaid <hi>Sampſon Carraſco.</hi> But come, let's go ſee the Meſſenger, and probably he'll clear our Doubts.</p>
                        <p>Thereupon going with <hi>Tereſa,</hi> they found the Page ſifting a little Corn for his Horſe, and <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chica</hi> cutting a Raſher of Bacon to be fry'd with Eggs for his Dinner. They both lik'd the Page's Meen and his Garb, and after the uſual Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Sampſon</hi> deſir'd him to tell 'em ſome News of Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and <hi>Sancho Panſa;</hi> for tho' they had read a Letter from the latter to his Wife, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Dutcheſs, they were no better than Riddles to 'em, nor could they imagine how <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> ſhou'd come by a Government, eſpecially of an Iſland, well knowing that all the Iſlands in the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean,</hi> or the greateſt Part of 'em, were the King's.</p>
                        <p>Gentlemen, anſwer'd the Page, 'tis a certain Truth, that Signior <hi>Sancho Panſa</hi> is a Governour, but whether it be of an Iſland or not, I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to determine: But this I can aſſure you, that he commands in a Town that has above a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Inhabitants. And as for my Lady Dutcheſs's
<pb n="1107" facs="tcp:54446:597"/>
ſending to a Country-woman for a few Acorns, that's no ſuch Wonder; for ſhe is ſo free from Pride, that I have known her ſend to borrow a Comb of one of her Neighbours. You muſt know, our Ladies of <hi>Arragon,</hi> tho' they are as noble as thoſe of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> do not ſtand ſo much upon For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities and Punctilio's; neither do they take ſo much State upon 'em; but treat People with more Familiarity.</p>
                        <p>While they were thus diſcourſing, in came <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chica</hi> skipping, with her Lap full of Eggs; and turning to the Page, Pray Sir, quoth ſhe by chance does my Father wear Trunk-Breeches now he's a Governour? Truly, ſaid the Page. I never mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, but without doubt he does. Oh Gemini, cry'd the young Wench, what wou'd not I give to ſee my Father in his Trunk Hoſe? Is it not a ſtrange Thing, that ever ſince I can remember my ſelf, I have wiſh'd to ſee my Father in Trunk-Breeches. You'll ſee him as you'd have him, ſaid the Page, if your Ladyſhip does but live. Odsſiſh, if his Government holds but two Months, you'll ſee him go with an Umbrella over his Head.</p>
                        <p>The Curate and the Batchelor plainly perceiv'd that the Page did but laugh at the Mother and the Daughter; but yet the coſtly String of Beads, and the Hunting Suit, which by this Time <hi>Tereſa</hi> had let 'em ſee, confounded 'em again. In the mean while they cou'd not forbear Smiling at <hi>Sanchica</hi>'s odd Fancy, and much leſs at what her Mother ſaid. Good Maſter Curate, quoth ſhe, do ſo much as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire whether any of our Neighbours are going to <hi>Madrid,</hi> or <hi>Toledo.</hi> I'd have 'em buy me a hugeous Farthingale, of the beſt cut courtly Faſhion, and the very fineſt that can be got for Money; for by my Holy Dame, I mean to credit my Husband's Government the beſt I can; and if they vex me
<pb n="1108" facs="tcp:54446:598"/>
I'll hie me to that ſame Court, and ride in my Coach too as well as the beſt of 'em; for ſhe that is a Governour's Lady may very well afford to have one. O rare, Mother, cry'd <hi>Sanchica,</hi> wou'd 'twere to Night before to Morrow. May hap, when they ſaw me ſitting in our Coach by my Lady Mother, they would jeer and flout, Look, look, would they ſay, yonder's Goody Trollop, the Plough-jobber's Bearn! How ſhe flaunts it, and goes ye lolling in her Coach like a little Pope <hi>Joan.</hi> But what would I care? Let 'em trudge on in the Dirt, while I ride by in my Coach. Shame and Ill-luck go along with all your little back-biting Scrubs. Let 'em laugh that win; the curs'd Fox thrives the better. Am I not in the Right, Mother? Ay, marry art thou, Child, quoth <hi>Tereſa;</hi> and indeed my good Honey <hi>Sancho</hi> has often told me, all theſe good Things and many more wou'd come to paſs; and thou ſhalt ſee, Daughter, I'll never reſt till I get to be a a Counteſs. There muſt be a Beginning in all Things, and as I have heard it ſaid by thy Father, who's alſo the Father of Proverbs, when a Cow's given thee, run and take her with a Halter. When they give thee a Government, take it, when an Earldom, catch it; and when they Whiſtle to thee with a good Gift, ſnap at it. That which is good to give is good to take, Girl. 'Twere a petty Fancy, trow, to lie ſnoring a Bed, and when Good-Luck knocks, not to riſe to open the Door. Ay, quoth <hi>Sanchica,</hi> what is't to me, tho' they ſhou'd ſay all they've a Mind to ſay. When they ſee me ſo tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fine, and ſo woundy great, let 'em ſpit their Venom, and ſay, ſet a Beggar a Horſe-back, and ſo forth. Who wou'd not think, ſaid the Curate, hearing this, but that the whole Race of the <hi>Panſa</hi>'s came into the World with their Paunches ſtuff'd with Proverbs. I never knew one of the Name
<pb n="1109" facs="tcp:54446:598"/>
but threw 'em out at all Times, let the Diſcourſe be what it wou'd. I think ſo too, ſaid the Page; for his Honour the Governour blunders 'em out at every Turn, many Times indeed wide from the Purpoſe; however, always to the Satisfaction of the Company, and with high Applauſe from my Lord and my Lady. Then Sir, you aſſure us ſtill, ſaid <hi>Carraſco,</hi> that <hi>Sancho</hi> is really a Governour; and that a Dutcheſs ſends theſe Preſents and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters upon his Account; for tho' we ſee the Things, and read the Letters, we can ſcarce prevail with our ſelves to believe; but are apt to run into our Friend Don <hi>Quixote's</hi> Opinion, and look on all this as the Effect of ſome Inchantment: So that I cou'd find in my Heart to feel and try whether you are a viſionary Meſſenger, or a Creature of Fleſh and Blood. For my Part, Gentlemen, anſwer'd the Page, all I can tell ye, is, that I am really the Meſſenger I appear to be, that the Lord <hi>Sancho Panſa</hi> is actually a Governour, and that the Duke and the Dutcheſs to whom I belong, are able to give, and have given him that Government, where I am credibly inform'd he behaves himſelf moſt worthily. Now if there be any Inchantment in the Matter, I leave you to examine that; for by the Life of my Parents, one of the greateſt Oaths I can utter, for they are both alive, and I love 'em dearly, I know no more of the Buſineſs. That may be, ſaid the Batchelor, but yet <hi>dubitat Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtinus.</hi> You may doubt if you pleaſe, reply'd the Page; but I have told you the Truth; which will always prevail over Falſhood, and riſe upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, as Oil does above Water. But if you will <hi>operibus credere &amp; non verbis;</hi> let one of ye go along with me, and you ſhall ſee with your Eyes what you will not believe by the Help of your Ears. I'll go with all my Heart, quoth <hi>Sanchica;</hi> take me up behind ye, Sir; I've a huge Mind to ſee my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="1110" facs="tcp:54446:599"/>
The Daughters of Governours, ſaid the Page, muſt not travel thus unattended, but in Coaches or Litters, and with a handſome Train of Servants. Cud's my Life, quoth <hi>Sanchica,</hi> I can go a Journey as well on an Aſs as in one of your Coaches. I am none of your tender ſqueamiſh Things, not I. Peace, Chicken, quoth the Mother, thou doſt not know what thou ſay'ſt, the Gentleman is in the right. Times are alter'd. When 'twas plain <hi>Sancho,</hi> 'twas plain <hi>Sanchica;</hi> but now he's a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, thou'rt a Lady. I can't well tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I am right or no. My Lady <hi>Tereſa</hi> ſays more than ſhe is aware of, ſaid the Page. But now, continu'd he, give me a Mouthful to eat as ſoon as you will, for I muſt go back this Afternoon. Be pleas'd then, Sir, ſaid the Curate, to go with me, and partake of a ſlender Meal at my Houſe, for my Neighbour <hi>Tereſa</hi> is more willing than able to entertain ſo good a Gueſt. The Page excus'd himſelf a While, but at laſt comply'd, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded 'twou'd be much for the better; and the Curate on his Side was glad of his Company, to have an Opportunity to inform himſelf at large about Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and his Proceedings. The Batchelor proffer'd <hi>Tereſa</hi> to write her Anſwers to her Letters; but as ſhe look'd upon him to be ſomewhat waggiſh, ſhe wou'd not permit him to be of her Counſel; ſo ſhe gave a Rowl, and a couple of Eggs, to a Young Acolite of the Church, who cou'd write, and he wrote two Letters for her; one to her Husband and the other to the Dutcheſs, all of her own Indicting, and perhaps not the worſt in this famous Hiſtory, as hereafter may be ſeen.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. LI.</hi> A Continuation of <hi>Sancho Panſa</hi>'s Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, with other Paſſages, ſuch as they are.</head>
                        <p>THE Morning of that Day aroſe, which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the Governour's rounding Night, the Remainder of which the Gentleman-waiter ſpent, not in Sleep, but in the pleaſing Thoughts of the lovely Face, and charming Graces of the diſguis'd Virgin; on the other Side, the Steward beſtow'd that Time in Writing to his Lord and Lady what <hi>Sancho</hi> did and ſaid; wondring no leſs at his Actions than at his Expreſſions, both which diſplay'd a ſtrange Intermixture of Diſcretion and Simplicity.</p>
                        <p>At laſt the Lord Governour was pleas'd to riſe; and, by Dr. <hi>Pedro Rezio</hi>'s Order, they brought him for his Breakfaſt a little Conſerve, and a Draught of Fair Water, which he wou'd have exchang'd with all his Heart for a good Luncheon of Bread, and a Bunch of Grapes, But ſeeing he cou'd not help himſelf, he was forc'd to make the beſt of a bad Market, and ſeem to be content, tho' full ſore againſt his Will and Appetite; for the Doctor made him believe, that to eat but little, and that which was dainty, enliven'd the Spirits, and ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd the Wit, and conſequently ſuch a Sort of Diet was moſt proper for Perſons in Authority and weighty Employments, wherein there is leſs Need of the Strength of the Body than of that of the
<pb n="1112" facs="tcp:54446:600"/>
Mind. This Sophiſtry ſerv'd to famiſh <hi>Sancho,</hi> who, half dead with Hunger, curs'd in his Heart both the Government and him that had given it him. However, hungry as he was, by the Strength of his ſlender Breakfaſt, he fail'd not to give Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that Day; and the firſt that came before him was a Stranger, who put the following Caſe to him; the Steward and the reſt of the Attendants being preſent.</p>
                        <p>My Lord, ſaid he, a large River divides in two Parts one and the ſame Lordſhip. I beg your Honour to lend me your Attention, for 'tis a Caſe of great Importance, and ſome Difficulty,—Upon this River there is a Bridge; at one End of which there ſtands a Gallows, and a Kind of a Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, where Four Judges uſe to ſit, for the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a certain Law made by the Lord of the Land and River, which runs thus,</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Whoever intends to paſs from one End of this Bridge to the other, muſt firſt upon his Oath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare whither he goes, and what his Buſineſs is. If he ſwear Truth, he may go on; but if he ſwear falſe, he ſhall be hang'd, and dye without Remiſſion upon the Gibbet at the End of the Bridge.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>After due Promulgation of this Law, many Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, notwithſtanding its Severity, adventur'd to go over this Bridge, and as it appear'd they ſwore Truth, the Judges permitted 'em to Paſs unmoleſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It happen'd one Day that a certain Paſſenger being ſworn, declar'd, that by the Oath he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, he was come to dye upon that Gallows, and that was all his Buſineſs.</p>
                        <p>This put the Judges to a Nonplus; for, ſaid they, If we let this Man paſs freely, he is forſworn, and according to the Letter of the Law he ought to dye: If we hang him, he has ſworn Truth, ſeeing
<pb n="1113" facs="tcp:54446:600"/>
he ſwore he was to dye on that Gibbet; and then by the ſame Law we ſhould let him paſs.</p>
                        <p>Now your Lordſhip's Judgment is deſir'd what the Judges ought to do with this Man? For they are ſtill at a ſtand, not knowing what to determine in this Caſe; and having been inform'd of your ſharp Wit, and great Capacity in reſolving difficult Queſtions, they ſent me to beſeech your Lordſhip in their Names, to give your Opinion in ſo intricate and knotty a Caſe.</p>
                        <p>To deal plainly with you, anſwer'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> Thoſe worſhipful Judges that ſent you hither, might as well have ſpar'd themſelves the Labour; for I am more inclin'd to Dullneſs I aſſure you than Sharpneſs: However, let me hear your Queſtion once more, that I may throughly underſtand it, and perhaps I may at laſt hit the Nail o'the Head. The Man repeated the Queſtion again and again; and when he had done, To my thinking, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> this Queſtion may be preſently anſwer'd; as thus: The Man ſwore he came to dye on the Gibbet, and if he dies there, he ſwore Truth, and according to the Law he ought to be free, and go over the Bridge. On the other Side, if you don't hang him, he ſwore falſe, and by the ſame Law he ought to be hang'd. 'Tis as your Lordſhip ſays, reply'd the Stranger, you have ſtated the Caſe right. Why then, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> ev'n let that Part of the Man that ſwore true, freely paſs; and hang the other Part of the Man that ſwore falſe, and ſo will the Law be fulfill'd. But then, my Lord, reply'd the Stranger, the Man muſt be divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into two Parts, which if we do, he certainly dies, and the Intent of the Law, which muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, is not put in Execution.</p>
                        <p>Well, hark you me, honeſt Man, ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I am a Codſhead, or there is as much Reaſon to put this ſame Perſon you talk of to Death, as to let
<pb n="1114" facs="tcp:54446:601"/>
him live and paſs the Bridge; for if the Truth ſaves him, the Lye caſts him as well. Now the Caſe ſtands thus, I would have you tell thoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that ſent you to me, ſince there's as much Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to bring him off, as to condemn him, that they e'en let him go free; for 'tis always more commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable to do Good than Hurt. And this I would give you under my own Hand, if I cou'd write. Nor do I ſpeak this of my own Head; but I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber one Precept, among many others that my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Don Quixote</hi> gave me the Night before I went to govern this Iſland, which was, that when the Scale of Juſtice is even, or a Caſe is doubtful, we ſhou'd prefer Mercy before Rigour; and it has pleas'd God I ſhould call it to Mind ſo luckily in this Inſtance. For my Part, ſaid the Steward, this Judgment ſeems to me ſo equitable, that I do not believe <hi>Lycurgus</hi> himſelf, who gave Laws to the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> could ever have decided the Matter better than the great <hi>Sancho</hi> has done.</p>
                        <p>And now, Sir ſure there's enough done for this Morning; be pleas'd to adjourn the Court, and I'll give Order that the Governour may dine to his Heart's Content. Well ſaid, cry'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> that's all I want, and then a clear Stage, and no Favour. Feed me well, and then ply me with Caſes and Queſtions thick and threefold; you ſhall ſee me untwiſt 'em, and lay 'em open as clear as the Sun.</p>
                        <p>The Steward was as good as his Word, believing it wou'd be a Burthen to his Conſcience to famiſh ſo wiſe a Governor; beſides he intended the next Night to put into Practice the laſt Trick, which he had Commiſſion to paſs upon him.</p>
                        <p>Now <hi>Sancho</hi> having plentifully din'd that Day, in ſpight of all the Aphoriſms of Doctor <hi>Tirte a fuera,</hi> when the Cloath was remov'd, in came an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs with a Letter from <hi>Don Quixote</hi> to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
<pb n="1115" facs="tcp:54446:601"/>
                           <hi>Sancho</hi> order'd the Secretary to read it to himſelf, and if there were nothing in it for ſecret Peruſal, then to read it aloud. The Secretary hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt run it over accordingly, My Lord, ſaid he, the Letter may not only be publickly read, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be engrav'd in Characters of Gold; and thus it is.</p>
                        <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                           <body>
                              <head>
                                 <hi>Don Quixote de la Mancha</hi> to <hi>Sancho Panſa,</hi> Governor of the Iſland of <hi>Barataria.</hi>
                              </head>
                              <p>WHen I expected to have had an Account of thy Careleſneſs and Impertinences, Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> I was agreeably diſappointed with News of thy wiſe Behaviour; for which I return particular Thanks to Heaven, that can raiſe the loweſt from their Poverty, and turn the Fool into a Man of Senſe. I hear thou governeſt with all the Diſcretion of a Man; and that, while thou approv'ſt thy ſelf one, thou retain'ſt the Humility of the meaneſt Creatures. But I deſire thee to obſerve, <hi>Sancho,</hi> that 'tis many Times very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and convenient to thwart the Humility of the Heart, for the better Support of the Authority of a Place. For the Ornament of a Perſon that is advanc'd to an eminent Poſt, muſt be anſwerable to its Greatneſs, and not debas'd to the Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his former Meanneſs. Let thy Apparel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neat and handſome; even a Stake well dreſs'd does not look like a Stake. I wou'd not have thee wear foppiſh, gaudy Things; nor affect the Garb of a Soldier, in the Circumſtances of a Magiſtrate; but let thy Dreſs be ſuitable to thy Degree, and always clean and decent.</p>
                              <p>To gain the Hearts of thy People, among other Things, I have two chiefly to recommend. One
<pb n="1116" facs="tcp:54446:602"/>
is, to be affable, courteous, and fair to all the World; I have already told thee of that: And the other, to take Care that Plenty of Proviſions be never wanting, for nothing afflicts or urges more the Spirits of the Poor, than Scarcity and Hunger.</p>
                              <p>Do not put out many new Orders, and if thou doſt put out any, ſee that they be wholeſome and good, and eſpecially that they be ſtrictly obſerv'd: For, Laws not well obey'd, are no better than if they were not made, and only ſhew that the Prince who had the Wiſdom and Authority to make 'em, had not Reſolution to ſee 'em executed; and Laws that only threaten, and are not kept, become like the Log that was given to the Frogs to be their King, which they fear'd at firſt, but ſoon ſcorn'd and trampl'd down.</p>
                              <p>Be a Father to Virtue, but a Father-in-Law to Vice. Be not always ſevere, nor always merciful; chuſe a Mean between theſe two Extreams; for in that middle Point is the Center of Diſcretion.</p>
                              <p>Viſit the Priſons, the Shambles, and the publick Markets, for the Governor's Preſence is highly neceſſary in ſuch Places.</p>
                              <p>Comfort the Priſoners that expect to be quickly diſpatch'd.</p>
                              <p>Be a Terror to the Butchers, that they may be fair in their Weights, and keep Huckſters and fraudulent Dealers in Awe, for the ſame Reaſon.</p>
                              <p>Should'ſt thou unhappily be inclin'd to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, given to Women, or a Glutton, as I hope thou art not, avoid ſhewing thy ſelf guilty of thoſe Vices; for when the Town, and thoſe that come near thee have diſcover'd thy Weakneſs, they'll be ſure to try thee on that Side, and tempt thee to thy everlaſting Ruin.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="1117" facs="tcp:54446:602"/>Read over and over, and ſeriouſly conſider the Admonitions and Documents I gave thee in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting before thou went'ſt to thy Government, and thou wilt find the Benefit of it, in all thoſe Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and Emergencies that ſo frequently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Function of a Governor.</p>
                              <p>Write to thy Lord and Lady, and ſhew thy ſelf grateful; for Ingratitude is the Off-ſpring of Pride, and one of the worſt Corruptions of the Mind; whereas he that is thankful to his Benefactors, gives a Teſtimony that he will be ſo to God, who has done, and continually does him ſo much good.</p>
                              <p>My Lady Dutcheſs diſpatch'd a Meſſenger on purpoſe to thy Wife <hi>Tereſa,</hi> with thy Hunting Suit, and another Preſent. We expect his Return every Moment.</p>
                              <p>I have been ſomewhat out of Order, by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cat Encounter I had lately, not much to the Advantage of my Noſe; but all that's nothing, for if there are Negromancers that miſuſe me, there are others ready to defend me.</p>
                              <p>Send me Word whether the Steward that is with thee had any Hand in the Buſineſs of the Counteſs of <hi>Trifaldi,</hi> as thou wert once of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and let me alſo have an Account of whatever befalls thee, ſince the Diſtance between us is ſo ſmall. I have Thoughts of leaving this idle Life e'er long; for I was not born for Luxury and Eaſe.</p>
                              <p>A Buſineſs has offer'd, that I believe will make me loſe the Duke and the Dutcheſs's Favour; but though I am heartily ſorry for't, that does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my Reſolution; for, after all, I owe more to my Profeſſion than to Complaiſance, and as the Saying is, <hi>Amicus Plato, ſed megis amica veritas.</hi> I ſend thee this Scrap of <hi>Latin,</hi> flattering my ſelf
<pb n="1118" facs="tcp:54446:603"/>
that ſince thou cam'ſt to be a Governor thou may'ſt have learn'd that Language. Farewel, and Heaven keep thee above the Pity of the World.</p>

I tell you this, dear Maſter of mine, that you may not marvel, why I han't yet let you know whether it goes well or ill with me in this ſame Government, where I am more hunger-ſtarv'd than when you and I wander'd through Woods and Wilderneſſes.</p>
                              <p>My Lord Duke wrote to me t'other Day, to inform me of ſome Spies that were got into this Iſland to kill me. But as yet I have diſcover'd
<pb n="1119" facs="tcp:54446:603"/>
none but a certain Doctor, hir'd by the Iſlanders to kill all the Governours that come near it. They call him Dr. <hi>Pedro Rezio de Aguero,</hi> and he was born at <hi>Tirte a fuera,</hi> his Name is enough to make me fear he'll be the Death of me. This ſame Doctor ſays of himſelf, that he does not cure Diſeaſes when you have 'em; but when you have 'em not; he only pretends to keep 'em from coming. The Phyſick he uſes, is Faſting upon Faſting, till he turns a Body to a meer Skeleton, as if to be waſled to Skin and Bones were not as bad as a Fever. In ſhort, he ſtarves me to Death; ſo that when I thought, as being a Governor, to have my Belly full of good hot Victuals, and cool Liquor, and to refreſh my Body in Holland Sheets, and on a ſoft Feather-bed, I am come to do Penance like a Hermit; and as I do it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly, I am afraid the Devil will have me at laſt.</p>

                              <p>Laſt Night going my Rounds, I met with a mighty handſome Damſel in Boy's Cloaths, and a Brother of hers in Woman's Apparel. My Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-waiter fell in Love with the Girl, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to make her his Wife, as he ſays. As for the Youth I have pitch'd upon him to be my Son-in-Law. To Day we both deſign to diſcourſe the Father, one <hi>Diego de la Llana,</hi> who's a
<pb n="1120" facs="tcp:54446:604"/>
Gentleman, and an old Chriſtian every Inch of him.</p>
                              <p>I Viſit the Markets, as you advis'd me, and Yeſterday found one of the Huckſters ſelling Hazle-Nuts; ſhe pretended they were all New, but I found ſhe had mix'd a whole Buſhel of old, empty, rotten Nuts among the ſame Quantity of new. With that I adjudg'd them to be given to the Hoſpital-Boys, who knew how to pick the good from the bad, and gave Sentence againſt her, that ſhe ſhould not come into the Market in fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Days; and People ſaid, I did well. What I can tell you, is, that if you'll believe the Folks of this Town, there's not a more raſcally Sort of People in the World than theſe Market-Women; for they are all a ſaucy, foul-mouth'd, impudent helliſh Rabble, and I judge 'em to be ſo, by thoſe I have ſeen in other Places.</p>
                              <p>I am mighty well pleas'd that my Lady Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs has writ to my Wife <hi>Tereſa Panſa,</hi> and ſent her the Token you mention. It ſhall go hard but I will requite her Kindneſs one Time or other. Pray give my Service to her, and tell her from me, ſhe has not caſt her Gift in a broken Sack, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than Words ſhall ſhew.</p>
                              <p>If I might adviſe you, and had my Wiſh, there ſhou'd be no falling out between your Worſhip, and my Lord and Lady; for, if you quarrel with 'em, 'tis I muſt come to the worſt on't: And ſince you mind me of being grateful, it won't look well in you not to be ſo to thoſe who have made ſo much of you at their Caſtle.</p>
                              <p>As for your Cat-Affair I can make nothing of it, only I fancy you are ſtill haunted after the old Rate. You'll tell me more when we meet.</p>
                              <p>I wou'd fain have ſent you a Token, but I do not know what to ſend, unleſs it were ſome

little Gliſter-Pipes, which they make here very curiouſly, and fix moſt cleaverly to the Bladders. But if I ſtay in my Place, it ſhall go hard but I'll get ſomething worth the ſending, be it what it will.</p>
                              <p>If my Wife <hi>Tereſa Panſa</hi> writes to me, pray pay the Poſtage, and ſend me the Letter; for I migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily long to hear how it is with her, and my Houſe and Children.</p>

Then thoſe who carry'd on the Plot againſt <hi>Sancho,</hi> combin'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and conſulted how to remove him from the Government: and <hi>Sancho</hi> paſs'd that Afternoon in making ſeveral Regulations, fot the better Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that which he imagin'd to be an Iſland.

He lower'd the Price of all Kind of Apparel, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly that of Shooes, as thinking it exorbitant.

                           <hi>CHAP. LII.</hi> A Relation of the Adventures of the ſecond diſconſolate or diſtreſt Matron, otherwiſe call'd <hi>Donna Rodriguez.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>
                           <hi>CID Hamet</hi> relates, that Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Scratches being heal'd, he began to think the Life he led in the Caſtle not ſuitable to the Order of Knight Errantry which he profeſs'd; he reſolv'd therefore to take Leave of the Duke and Dutcheſs, and ſet forwards for <hi>Saragoſa;</hi> where, at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Tournament, he hop'd to win the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, the uſual Prize at the Feſtivals of that Kind. Accordingly as he ſat at Table with the Lord and Lady of the Caſtle, he began to acquaint 'em with his Deſign, when behold two Women entred the great Hall, clad in deep Mourning from Head to Foot. One of 'em approaching Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> threw her ſelf at his Feet, where lying proſtrate, and in a manner kiſſing 'em, ſhe fetch'd ſuch deep and doleful Sighs, and made ſuch ſorrowful Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, that all thoſe who were by, were not a little ſurpriz'd. And tho' the Duke and the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs imagin'd it to be ſome new Device of their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants againſt Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> yet perceiving with what Earneſtneſs the Woman ſigh'd and lamented, they were in doubt, and knew not what to think, till the compaſſionate Champion, raiſing her from the Ground, engag'd her to lift up her Veil, and diſcover, what they leaſt expected, the Face of <hi>Donna Rodriguez,</hi> the Duena of the Family; and the
<pb n="1124" facs="tcp:54446:606"/>
other Mourner prov'd to be her Daughter, whom the rich Farmer's Son had deluded. All thoſe that knew 'em were in great Admiration, eſpecially the Duke and the Dutcheſs; for though they knew her Simplicity, and Indiſcretion, they did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve her to be ſo far gone in Madneſs. At laſt the ſorrowful Matron addreſſing her ſelf to the Duke and Dutcheſs; May it pleaſe your Graces, ſaid ſhe, to permit me to direct my Diſcourſe to this Knight, for it concerns me to get out of an unlucky Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, into which the Impudence of a treacherous Villain has brought us. With that the Duke gave her Leave to ſay what ſhe wou'd, then applying her ſelf to Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> 'tis not long, ſaid ſhe, valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Knight, ſince I gave your Worſhip an Account how baſely and treacherouſly a graceleſs young Farmer had us'd my dear Child, the poor undone Creature here preſent; and you then promis'd me to ſtand up for her, and ſee her righted; and now I underſtand you are about to leave this Caſtle, in queſt of the good Adventures Heaven ſhall ſend you. And therefore before you are gone no body knows whither, I have this Boon to beg of your Worſhip, that you would do ſo much as challenge this ſturdy Clown, and make him marry my Daughter, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Promiſe before he was concern'd with her. For, as for my Lord Duke, 'tis a Folly to think he'll ever ſee me righted, for the Reaſon I told you in private. And ſo Heaven preſerve your Worſhip, and ſtill be our Defence. Worthy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron (anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> with a great deal of Gravity and ſolemn Form) temperate your Tears, or to ſpeak more properly, dry 'em up, and ſpare your Sighs; for I take upon me to ſee your Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's Wrongs redreſs'd; though ſhe had done much better, had not her too great Credulity made her truſt the Proteſtations of Lovers, which generally
<pb n="1125" facs="tcp:54446:606"/>
are readily made, but moſt uneaſily perform'd. Therefore, with my Lord Duke's Permiſſion, I will inſtantly depart to find out this ungracious Wretch, and as ſoon as he is found, I will chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge him, and kill him if he perſiſts in his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy; for the chief End of my Profeſſion is to pardon the Submiſſive, and to chaſtiſe the Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born; to relieve the Miſerable, and deſtroy the Cruel. Sir Knight, ſaid the Duke, you need not give your ſelf the Trouble of ſeeking the Fellow, of whom that good Matron complains; nor need you ask me Leave to challenge him; for I already engage that he ſhall meet you in Perſon to anſwer it here in this Caſtle, where ſafe Liſts ſhall be ſet up for you both, obſerving all the Laws of Arms that ought to be kept in Affairs of this Kind, and doing each Party Juſtice, as all Princes ought to do, that admit of ſingle Combats within their Territories. Upon that Aſſurance, ſaid Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote,</hi> with your Grace's Leave, I for this time wave my Punctilio's of Gentility, and debaſing my ſelf to the Meanneſs of the Offender, qualify him to meaſure Launces with me; and ſo let him be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent or preſent, I challenge and defy him, as a Villain that has deluded this poor Creature, that was a Maid, and now through his Baſeneſs is none, and he ſhall either perform his Promiſe of making her his lawful Wife, or die in the Conteſt. With that, pulling off his Glove, he flung it down into the Middle of the Hall, and the Duke took it up, declaring as he had already done, that he accepted the Challenge in the name of his Vaſſal; fixing the Time for Combat to be ſix Days after, and the Place to be the Caſtle-court. The Arms to be ſuch as are uſual among Knights, as Lance, Shield, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of Proof, and all other Pieces, without Fraud,
<pb n="1126" facs="tcp:54446:607"/>
Advantage, or Inchantment, after Search made by the Judges of the Field.</p>
                        <p>But in the firſt Place, added the Duke, 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, that this true Matron, and this falſe Virgin, commit the Juſtice of their Cauſe into the Hands of their Champion, for otherwiſe there will be nothing done, and the Challenge is void in courſe. I do, anſwer'd the Matron; and ſo do I, added the Daughter, all aſham'd, blubbering, and in a crying Tone. The Preliminaries being adjuſted, and the Duke having reſolv'd with himſelf what to do in the Matter, the mourning Petitioners went away, and the Dutcheſs order'd they ſhould no longer be look'd upon as her Domeſticks, but as Ladies-Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that came to demand Juſtice in her Caſtle; and accordingly there was a peculiar Apartment appointed for 'em, where they were ſerv'd as Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; to the Amazement of the other Servants, who could not imagine what would be the End of <hi>Donna Rodriguez</hi> and her forſaken Daughter's ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous and confident Undertaking.</p>
                        <p>Preſently after this, to compleat their Mirth, and as it were for the laſt Courſe, in came the Page that had carry'd the Letters and the Preſents to <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſa Panſa.</hi> The Duke and Dutcheſs were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd to ſee him return'd, having a great Deſire to know the Succeſs of his Journey. They enquir'd of him accordingly, but he told 'em, that the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he had to give 'em could not well be deliver'd in Publick, nor in few Words; and therefore begg'd their Graces would be pleas'd to take it in private, and in the mean time entertain themſelves with thoſe Letters. With that, taking out two, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd 'em to her Grace. The Superſcription of the one was, <hi>Theſe for my Lady Dutcheſs of I don't know what Place:</hi> And the Direction on the other thus, <hi>To my Husband</hi> Sancho Panſa, <hi>Governour of the Iſland
<pb n="1127" facs="tcp:54446:607"/>
of</hi> Barataria, <hi>whom Heaven proſper as many or more Years than me.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Dutcheſs ſat upon Thorns till ſhe had read her Letter, ſo having open'd it and run it over to her ſelf, finding there was nothing of Secrecy in it, ſhe read it out aloud, that the whole Company might hear what follows.</p>

                              <p>THE Letter your Honour ſent me pleas'd me huge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly; for Troth 'tis what I heartily long'd for. The String of Coral is a good Thing, and my Husband's Hunting Suit may come up to it. All our Town takes it mighty kindly, and is very glad, that your Honour has made my Spouſe a Governor, though no Body will believe it, eſpecially our Curate, Maſter <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Barber, and <hi>Sampſon Carraſco</hi> the Batchelor. But what care I, whether they do or no? So it be true, as it is, let every one have their Saying. Though 'tis a Folly to lye, I had not believ'd it neither, but for the Coral and the Suit; for every Body here takes my Husband to be a Dolt, and can't for the Blood of 'em imagine what he can be fit to govern, unleſs it be a Herd of Goats. Well! Heaven be his Guide, and ſpeed him as he ſees beſt for his Children. As for me, my dear Lady, I am reſolv'd, with your good liking, to make Hay while the Sun ſhines, and go to Court, to loll it along in a Coach, and make a world of my Back-Friends, that envy me already, ſtare their Eyes out. And therefore, good your Honour, pray bid my Husband ſend me ſome Stock of Money; for 'tis dear living at Court; one can have but little Bread there for Six-pence, and a Pound of Fleſh is worth thirty Maravedies, which would make one ſtand amaz'd. And if he is not for my going let him ſend me Word in time, for my Feet itch to
<pb n="1128" facs="tcp:54446:608"/>
be jogging; for my Goſſips and Neighbours tell me, that if I and my Daughter go about the Court as we ſhould, ſpruce and fine, and at a taring Rate, my Husband will be better known by me, than I by him; for many can't chuſe but ask what Ladies are thoſe in the Coach? With that, one of my Servants anſwers, The Wife and Daughter of <hi>Sancho Panſa</hi> Governor of the Iſland of <hi>Barataria,</hi> and thus ſhall my Husband be known, and I honour'd far and near; and ſo have at all, <hi>Rome</hi> has Pardons.</p>
                              <p>You can't think how I am troubl'd that we have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd no Acorns hereaway this Year; however, I ſend your Highneſs about half a Peck, which I have cull'd one by one: I went to the Mountains on purpoſe, and got the biggeſt I could find; I wiſh they had been as big as <hi>Oſtrich</hi> Eggs.</p>
                              <p>Pray let not your Pompoſity forget to write to me, and I'll be ſure to ſend you an Anſwer, and let you know how I do, and ſend you all the News in our Village, where I am waiting and praying the Lord to preſerve your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and not to forget me.

                              <p>I Receiv'd thy Letter, dear Honey <hi>Sancho,</hi> and I vow and ſwear to thee, as I am a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Chriſtian, I was within two Fingers breadth of running Mad for Joy. Look you, my Chuck, when I heard thou wert made a Governor, I was ſo tranſported, I had like to have fallen down dead with meer Gladneſs; for thou knoweſt ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Joy is ſaid to kill as ſoon as great Sorrow. As for thy Daughter <hi>Sanchica,</hi> ſhe ſcatter'd her Water about, before ſhe was aware, for very Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. I had the Suit thou ſent'ſt me before my Eyes, and the Lady Dutcheſs's Corals about my Neck, held the Letter in my Hands, and had him that brought 'em ſtanding by me; and for all that, I thought what I ſaw and felt was but a Dream. For who could have thought a Goat-herd ſhould ever come to be a Governour of Iſlands? But what ſaid my Mother, <hi>Who a great deal would ſee, a great while muſt live.</hi> I ſpeak this, becauſe if I live longer, I mean to ſee more; for I ſhall ne'er be at Reſt till I ſee thee a Farmer or Receiver of the Cuſtoms: For though they be Offices that ſend many to the Devil, for all that they bring Griſt to the Mill. My Lady Dutcheſs will tell thee, how I long to go to Court. Pray think on't, and let me know thy Mind; for I mean to credit thee there, by going in a Coach.</p>
                              <p>Neither the Curate, the Barber, the Batchelor, nor the Sexton will believe thou art a Governor, but ſay 'tis all Juggling or Inchantment, as all thy Maſter Don <hi>Quixotes</hi>'s Concerns uſe to be, and <hi>Sampſon</hi> threatens to find thee out, and put
<pb n="1130" facs="tcp:54446:609"/>
this Maggot of a Government out of thy Pate, and Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Madneſs out of his Coxcomb. For my Part, I do but laugh at 'em, and look upon my ſtring of Coral, and contrive how to fit up the Suit thou ſent'ſt me into a Gown for thy Daughter.</p>
                              <p>I ſent my Lady the Dutcheſs ſome Acorns; I would they were beaten Gold. I prethee ſend me ſome Strings of Pearl, if they be in faſhion in thy Iſland.</p>
                              <p>The News here is, that <hi>Berrueca</hi> has marry'd her Daughter to a ſorry Painter that came hither, pretending to paint any Thing. The Townſhip ſet him to paint the King's Arms over the Town-Hall: He ask'd 'em two Ducats for the Job, which they paid him; ſo he fell to Work; and was eight Days a daubing, but could make nothing on't at laſt; and, ſaid he could not hit upon ſuch piddling Kind of Work, and ſo gave 'em their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney again. Yet for all this he marry'd with the Name of a good Work-man. The Truth is, he has left his Pencil upon't, and taken the Spade, and goes to the Field like a Gentleman. <hi>Pedro de Lobo</hi>'s Son has taken Orders, and ſhav'd his Crown, meaning to be a Prieſt. <hi>Minguilla, Mingo Silvato</hi>'s Grand-Daughter heard of it, and ſues him upon a Promiſe of Marriage: Ill Tongues do not ſtick to ſay ſhe has been with Child by him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he ſtiffly denies it. We have no Olives this Year, nor is there a Drop of Vinegar to be got for Love or Money. A Company of Soldiers went through this Place, and carry'd along with them three Wenches out of the Town, I don't tell thee their Names, for mayhaps they will come back, and there will not want ſome that will marry 'em, for better for worſe <hi>Sanchica</hi> makes Bone-lace, and gets her three Half-pence a-day clear, which
<pb n="1131" facs="tcp:54446:609"/>
ſhe ſaves in a Box with a Slit, to go towards buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Houſhold-ſtuff. But now ſhe's a Governor's Daughter ſhe has no need to work, for thou wilt give her a Portion. The Fountain in the Market is dry'd up. A Thunderbolt fell upon the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lory. There may they all light. I expect thy Anſwer to this, and thy Reſolution concerning my going to Court; ſo Heaven ſend thee long to live, and longer than my ſelf, or rather, neither more nor leſs, for I would not willingly leave thee behind me in this World.</p>

                        <p>TO think the Affairs of this Life are always to remain in the ſame State, is an errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Fancy. The Face of Things rather ſeems con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to change and roll with a circular Motion. Summer ſucceeds the Spring; Autumn the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; Winter the Autumn; and then Spring again: So Time proceeds in this perpetual Round; only the Life of Man is ever haſtning to its End, ſwifter than Time it ſelf, without Hopes to be renew'd, unleſs in the next, that is unlimited and infinite. This ſays <hi>Cid Hamet,</hi> the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Philoſopher. For even by the Light of Nature, and without that of Faith, many have diſcover'd the Swiftneſs and Inſtability of this preſent Being, and the Duration of the Eternal Life which is expected. But this moral Reflection of our Author is not here to be ſuppos'd as meant by him in its full Extent; for he intended it only to ſhew the Uncertainty of <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Fortune, how ſoon it vaniſh'd like a Dream, and how from his high Preferment he return'd to his former low Station.</p>
                        <p>It was now but the ſeventh Night, after ſo many Days of his Government, when the careful Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor had betaken himſelf to his Repoſe, ſated not with Bread and Wine, but cloy'd with hearing Cauſes, pronouncing Sentences, making Statutes, and putting out Orders and Proclamations: Scarce
<pb n="1133" facs="tcp:54446:610"/>
was Sleep, in ſpight of wakeful Hunger, beginning to cloſe his Eyes, when of a ſudden he heard a great Noiſe of Bells, and moſt dreadful Out-cries, as if the whole Iſland had been ſinking. Preſently he ſtarted, and ſat up in his Bed, and liſten'd with great Attention, to try if he could learn how far this Uproar might concern him. But while he was thus hearkening in the Dark, a great Number of Drums and Trumpets were heard, and that Sound being added to the Noiſe of the Bells and the Cries, gave ſo dreadful an Alarm, that his Fear and Terror increas'd, and he was in a ſad Conſternation. Up he leap'd out of his Bed, and put on his Slippers, the Ground being damp, and without any Thing elſe in the World on but his Shirt, ran and open'd his Chamber-door, and ſaw above twenty Men come running along the Galleries with lighted Links in one Hand, and drawn Swords in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, all crying out, Arm my Lord Governour, Arm! a World of Enemies are got into the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and we are undone, unleſs your Valour and Conduct relieve us. Thus bawling, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with great Fury and Diſorder, they got to the Door where <hi>Sancho</hi> ſtood quite ſcar'd out of his Senſes. Arm, Arm, this Moment, my Lord, cry'd one of 'em, if you have not a mind to be loſt with the whole Iſland. What would ye have me Arm for, quoth <hi>Sancho?</hi> Do I know any thing of Arms or Fighting, think ye? Why don't ye rather ſend for Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> my Maſter, he'll diſpatch your Enemies in a trice. Alas, as I am a Sinner to Heaven, I underſtand nothing of this haſty Service. For Shame, my Lord Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, ſaid another, what a Faint-heartedneſs is this? See! we bring you here Arms offenſive and defenſive; Arm your ſelf, and march to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place. Be our Leader and Captain as you ought,
<pb n="1134" facs="tcp:54446:611"/>
and ſhew your ſelf a Governor. Why then arm me, and good Luck attend me, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> with that they brought him two large Shields, which they had provided, and without letting him put on his other Cloaths, clapp'd 'em over his Shirt, and ty'd the one behind upon his Back, and the other before upon his Breaſt, having got his Arms through ſome Holes made on purpoſe. Now the Shields being faſten'd to his Body, as hard as Cords could bind 'em, the poor Governor was cas'd up and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur'd as ſtraight as an Arrow, without being able ſo much as to bend his Knees, or ſtir a Step. Then having put a Lance into his Hand for him to lean upon, and keep himſelf up, they deſir'd him to march, and lead 'em on, and put Life into 'em all, telling him that they did not doubt of Victory, ſince they had him for their Commander. March! quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> how do ye think I am able to do it, ſqueez'd as I am? Theſe Boards ſtick ſo plaguy cloſe to me, I can't ſo much as bend the Joynts of my Knees; You muſt e'en carry me in your Arms, and lay me a croſs, or ſet me upright before ſome Paſſage, and I'll make good that Spot of Ground, either with this Lance or my Body. Go to, my Lord Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, ſaid another, 'tis more your Fear than your Armour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The poor Governor thus urg'd and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided, endeavour'd to go forwards; but the firſt Motion he made, threw him to the Ground at his full Length, ſo heavily, that he gave over all his Bones for broken; and there he lay like a huge Tortoiſe in his Shell, or a Flitch of Bacon clapp'd between two Boards, or like a Boat overturn'd upon a Flat, with the Keel upwards. Nor had thoſe drolling Companions the leaſt Compaſſion upon him
<pb n="1135" facs="tcp:54446:611"/>
as he lay; quite contrary, having put out their Lights, they made a terrible Noiſe, and clutter'd with their Swords, and trampl'd too and again up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the poor Governor's Body, and laid on furiouſly with their Swords upon his Shields, inſomuch, that if he had not ſhrunk his Head into 'em for Shelter, he had been in a woful Condition. Shrugg'd up in his narrow Shell, he was in a grievous Fright, and a terrible Sweat, praying from the Bottom of his Heart for Deliverance from the curſed Trade of governing Iſlands. Some kick'd him, ſome ſtumbl'd and fell upon him, and one among the reſt jump'd full upon him, and there ſtood for ſome Time, as on a Watch-Tower, like a General encouraging his Soldiers, and giving Orders, crying out, There Boys, there! the Enemies charge moſt on that Side, make good that Breach, ſecure that Gate, down with thoſe Scaling-Ladders, fetch Fire-balls, more Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadoes, burning Pitch, Roſin, and Kettles of ſcald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Oyl. Intrench your ſelves, get Beds, Quilts, Cuſhions, and barricadoe the Streets; in ſhort, he call'd for all the Inſtruments of Death, and all the Engines us'd for the Defence of a City that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieg'd and ſtorm'd. <hi>Sancho</hi> lay ſnug, though ſadly bruis'd, and while he endur'd all quietly, Oh that it would pleaſe the Lord, quoth he to himſelf, that this Iſland were but taken, or that I were fairly dead or out of this Peck of Troubles. At laſt Heaven heard his Prayers, and when he leaſt expected it, he heard 'em cry, Victory, Victory! The Enemy's routed. Now my Lord Governour, riſe, come and enjoy the Fruits of Conqueſt, and divide the Spoils taken from the Enemy, by the Valour of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Arms. Help me up, cry'd poor <hi>Sancho</hi> in a doleful Tone; and when they had ſet him on his Legs, let all the Enemy I have routed, quoth he, be nail'd to my Fore-head: I'll divide no Spoils of
<pb n="1136" facs="tcp:54446:612"/>
Enemies. But if I have one Friend here, I only beg he would give me a Draught of Wine to comfort me, and help to dry up the Sweat that I am in; for I am all over Water. Thereupon they wip'd him, gave him Wine, and took off his Shields: after that, as he ſate upon his Bed, what with his Fright, and what with the Toil he had endur'd, he fell into a Swoon, inſomuch, that thoſe who acted this Scene began to repent they had carry'd it ſo far. But <hi>Sancho</hi> recovering from his Fit in a little Time, they alſo recover'd from their Uneaſineſs. Being come to himſelf, he ask'd what 'twas a Clock? They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd 'twas now Break of Day. He ſaid nothing, but, without any Words, began to put on his Cloaths. While this was doing, and he continu'd ſeriouſly ſilent, all the Eyes of the Company were fix'd upon him, wondring what could be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his being in ſuch Haſte to put on his Cloaths. At laſt he made an End of dreſſing himſelf, and creeping along ſoftly, (for he was too much bruis'd to go along very faſt) he got to the Stable, follow'd by all the Company, and coming to <hi>Dapple,</hi> he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd the quiet Animal, gave him a loving Kiſs on the Fore-head, and with Tears in his Eyes, Coms hither, ſaid he, my Friend, thou faithful Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and Fellow-ſharer in my Travels and Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, when thee and I conſorted together, and all my Cares were but to mend thy Furniture, and feed thy little Carcaſs, then happy were my Days, my Months, and Years. But ſince I forſook thee, and clamber'd up the Towers of Ambition and Pride, a thouſand Woes, a thouſand Torments, and four thouſand Tribulations have haunted and worry'd my Soul. While he was talking thus, he fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on his Pack-Saddle, no Body offering to ſay any thing to him. This done, with a great deal of Difficulty he mounted his Aſs, and then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing

himſelf to the Steward, the Secretary, the Genleman-waiter, and Doctor <hi>Pedro Rezio,</hi> and many others that ſtood by, make Way, Gentlemen, ſaid he, and let me return to my former Liberty. Let me go that I may ſeek my old Courſe of Life, and riſe again from that Death that buries me here alive. I was not born to be a Governour, nor to defend Iſlands nor Cities from Enemies that break in upon 'em. I know better what belongs to Ploughing, Delving, Pruning and Planting of Vineyards, than how to make Laws and defend Countries and Kingdoms. St. <hi>Peter</hi> is very well at <hi>Rome:</hi> That is as good as to ſay, let every one ſtick to the Calling he was born to. A Spade does better in my Hand than a Governour's Truncheon, and I had rather fill my Belly with a Meſs of plain Porridge, than lie at the Mercy of a coxcombly Phyſick-monger that ſtarves me to Death. I had rather ſolace my ſelf under the Shade of an Oak in Summer, and wrap my Corps up in a double Sheep-skin in the Winter at my Liberty, than lay me down with the Slavery of a Government in fine Holland Sheets, and caſe my Hide in Furs and richeſt Sables. Heaven be with you, Gentlefolks, and pray tell my Lord the Duke from me, that naked I was born, and naked I am at preſent. I have neither won nor loſt, which is as much as to ſay, without a Penny I came to this Government, and without a Penny I leave it; quite contrary to what other Governours of Iſlands uſe to do when they leave 'em. Clear the Way then, I beſeech you, and let me paſs; I muſt get my ſelf wrapp'd up all over in Sear-cloath; for I don't think I've a ſound Rib left, thanks to the Enemies that have walk'd over me all Night long. This muſt not be, my Lord Governour, ſaid Doctor <hi>Rezio,</hi> for I will give your Honour a Balſamick Drink, that is a
<pb n="1138" facs="tcp:54446:613"/>

'Tis too late, Mr. Doctor, anſwer'd <hi>Sancho;</hi> You ſhall as ſoon make me turn <hi>Turk</hi> as hinder me from going. No, no, theſe Tricks ſhan't paſs upon me again, you ſhall as ſoon make me fly to Heaven without Wings, as get me to ſtay here, or ever catch me nibbling at a Government again, though it were ſerv'd up to me in a cover'd Diſh. I am of the Blood of the <hi>Pança</hi>'s, and we are all willful and poſitive. If once we cry odd, it ſhall be odd in ſpight of all Mankind, tho' it be even. Go to then, Let the Piſmire leave behind him in this Stable thoſe Wings that lifted him up in the Air to be a Prey to Martlets and Sparrows. Fair and Softly. Let me now tread again on plain ground, though I mayn't wear pink'd Cordovan-Leather-Pumps, I ſhan't want a coarſe Pair of packthread Sandals to my Feet. Every Sheep to her Mate. Let not the Cobler go beyond his Laſt; and ſo let me go, for 'tis late. My Lord Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ſaid the Steward, though it grieves us to part with your Honour, your Senſe and Chriſtian Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour engaging us to covet your Company, yet we would nor preſume to ſtop you againſt your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination: But you know that every Governour, before he leaves the Place he has govern'd, is bound to give an Account of his Adminiſtration. Be pleas'd therefore to do ſo for the ten Days you have been among us, and then Peace be with you. No Man has Power to call me to an Account, reply'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> unleſs it be by my Lord Duke's Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now to him it is that I am going, and to him I'll give a fair and ſquare Account. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<pb n="1139" facs="tcp:54446:613"/>
going away ſo bare as I do, there needs no greater Signs that I have govern'd like an Angel. In truth, ſaid Dr. <hi>Rezio,</hi> the great <hi>Sancho</hi> is in the right; and I am of Opinion, we ought to let him go; for certainly the Duke will be very glad to ſee him. Thereupon they all agree'd to let him paſs, offering firſt to attend him, and ſupply him with whatever he might want in his Journey, either for Entertainment or Conveniency. <hi>Sancho</hi> told 'em, that all he deſir'd was a little Corn for his Aſs, and half a Cheeſe and half a Loaf for himſelf; having Occaſion for no other Proviſions in ſo ſhort a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. With that they all embrac'd him, and he embrac'd them all, not without Tears in his Eyes, leaving 'em in Admiration of the good Senſe which he diſcover'd both in his Diſcourſe and unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Reſolution.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. LIV.</hi> Which treats of Matters that relate to this Hiſtory and no other.</head>
                        <p>THE Duke and Dutcheſs reſolv'd that Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Challenge againſt their Vaſſal ſhould not be ineffectual; and the young Man being fled into <hi>Flanders,</hi> to avoid having <hi>Donna Rodriguez</hi> to his Mother-in-Law, they made choice of a <hi>Gaſcoin</hi> Lacquey, nam'd <hi>Toſilos,</hi> to ſupply his Place, and gave him Inſtructions how to act his Part. Two Days after, the Duke acquainted Don <hi>Quixote</hi> that within four Days his Antagoniſt would meet him in the Liſts, arm'd at all Points like a Knight, to maintain that the Damſel ly'd through the Throat,
<pb n="1140" facs="tcp:54446:614"/>
and through the Beard, to ſay that he had ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd her Marriage. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was mightily pleas'd with this News, promiſing himſelf to do Wonders on this Occaſion, and eſteeming it an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Happineſs to have ſuch an Opportunity to ſhew before ſuch Noble Spectators how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive were his Valour and his Strength. Cheer'd and elevated with theſe Hopes, he waited for the End of theſe four Days, which his eager Impatience made him think ſo many Ages.</p>
                        <p>Well, now letting them paſs, as we do other Matters, let us a while attend <hi>Sancho,</hi> who, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded betwixt Joy and Sorrow, was now on his <hi>Dap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> making the beſt of his Way to his Maſter, whoſe Company he valu'd more than the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the Iſlands in the World. He had not gone far from his Iſland, or City, or Town (or whatever you will pleaſe to call it, for he never troubl'd himſelf to examine what it was) before he met upon the Road ſix Pilgrims, with their walking Staves, Foreigners as they prov'd, and ſuch as us'd to beg Alms ſinging. As they drew near him, they plac'd themſelves in a Row, and fell a ſinging all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in their Language ſomething that <hi>Sancho</hi> could not underſtand, unleſs it were one Word, which plainly ſignify'd Alms; by which he gueſs'd that Charity was the Burthen and Intent of their Song. Being exceeding charitable, as <hi>Cid Hamet</hi> reports him, he open'd his Wallet, and having taken out half a Loaf and half a Cheeſe, gave 'em that, making Signs withal, that he had nothing elſe to give 'em. They took the Dole with a good will, but yet, not ſatisfi'd, they cry'd <hi>Guelt, Guelt.</hi> Good People, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I don't underſtand what you would have. With that, one of 'em pull'd out a Purſe that was in his Boſom, and ſhew'd it to <hi>Sancho,</hi> by which he underſtood that 'twas Money they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="1141" facs="tcp:54446:614"/>
But he, putting his Thumb to his Mouth, and wagging his Hand with his four Fingers upwards, made a Sign that he had not a Croſs; and ſo clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his Heels to <hi>Dapple</hi>'s Sides, he began to make way through the Pilgrims; but at the ſame time one of 'em, who had been looking on him very earneſtly, laid hold on him, and throwing his Arms about his Middle, Bleſs me! (cry'd he in very good <hi>Spaniſh</hi>) What do I ſee? Is it poſſible? Do I hold in my Arms my dear Friend, my good Neighbour <hi>Sancho Pança?</hi> Yes, ſure, it muſt be he, for I am neither drunk nor dreaming. <hi>Sancho</hi> wondring to hear himſelf call'd by his Name, and to ſee himſelf ſo lovingly hugg'd by the Pilgrim, ſtar'd upon him without ſpeaking a Word; but, tho' he look'd ſeriouſly in his Face a good while, he could not gueſs who he was. The Pilgrim obſerving his Amazement, What, ſaid he, Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> don't you know your old Acquaintance, your Neighbour <hi>Ricote</hi> the <hi>Moriſco,</hi> that kept a Shop in your Town? Then <hi>Sancho</hi> looking wiſtly on him again, began to call him to Mind, at laſt he knew him again perfectly, and clipping him about the Neck with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out alighting, <hi>Ricote,</hi> cry'd he, Who the Devil could ever have hnown thee tranſmogrify'd in this Mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Dreſs. Prithee who has frenchify'd thee at this rate? and how durſt thou offer to come again into <hi>Spain?</hi> Should'ſt thou come to be known, adad, I would not be in thy Coat for all the World. If thou doſt not betray me, ſaid the Pilgrim, I am ſafe enough, <hi>Sancho;</hi> for no Body can know me in this Diſguiſe. But let us get out of the Road, and make to yonder Elm-Grove, my Comrades and I have agreed to take a little Refreſhment there, and thou ſhalt dine with us. They are honeſt Souls I'll aſſure thee. There I ſhall have an Opportunity to tell thee how I have paſs'd my Time ſince I was
<pb n="1142" facs="tcp:54446:615"/>
forc'd to leave the Town in Obedience to the King's Edict, which, as thou knoweſt, ſo ſeverely threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens thoſe of our unfortunate Nation. <hi>Sancho</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, and <hi>Ricote</hi> having ſpoke to the reſt of the Pilgrims, they went all together to the Grove, at a good Diſtance from the Road. There they laid by their Staves, and taking off their Pilgrims Weeds remain'd in Cuerpo; all of 'em young handſome Fellows, except <hi>Ricote,</hi> who was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſtricken in Years. Every one carry'd his Wallet, which ſeem'd well furniſh'd, at leaſt with ſavoury and high-ſeaſon'd Bits, the Provocative to the turning down good Liquor. They ſat down on the Ground, and making the green Graſs their Table-cloath, preſently there was a comfortable Appearance of Bread, Salt, Knives, Nuts, Cheeſe, and ſome Bacon-bones, on which there were ſtill ſome good pickings left, or which at leaſt might be ſuck'd. They alſo had a Kind of black meat call'd <hi>Caveer,</hi> made of the Roes of Fiſh, a certain Charm to keep Thirſt awake. They alſo had good Store of Olives, though none of the moiſteſt; but the chief Glory of the Feaſt, was ſix Leather Bottles of Wine, every Pilgrim exhibiting one for his Share; even honeſt <hi>Ricote</hi> himſelf was now transform'd from a <hi>Moriſco,</hi> to a <hi>German,</hi> and clubb'd his Bottle, his Quota making as good a Figure as the reſt. They began to eat like Men that lik'd mighty well their ſavoury Fare; and as it was very reliſhing, they went leiſurely to work to continue the longer, taking but a little of every one at a time on the point of a Knife. Then all at once they lifted up their Arms, and applying their own Mouths to the Mouths of the Bottles, and turning up their Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms in the Air, with their Eyes fix'd on Heaven, like Men in an Extaſy, they remain'd in that Poſture a good while, tranfuſing the Blood and Spirit of the
<pb n="1143" facs="tcp:54446:615"/>
Veſſels into their Stomachs, and ſhaking their Heads, as in a Rapture, to expreſs the Pleaſure they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd. <hi>Sancho</hi> admir'd all this extreamly; he could not find the leaſt Fault with it, quite contrary he was for making good the Proverb, <hi>When thou art at</hi> Rome, <hi>do as they do at</hi> Rome; ſo he deſir'd <hi>Ricote</hi> to lend him his Bottle, and taking his Aim as well as the reſt, and with no leſs Satisfaction, ſhew'd 'em he wanted neither Method nor Breath. Four times they careſs'd the Bottles in that manner, but there was no doing it the Fifth; for they were quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, and the Life and Soul of 'em departed, which turn'd their Mirth into Sorrow. But while the Wine laſted all was well. Now and then one or other of the Pilgrims would take <hi>Sancho</hi> by the right hand, <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and <hi>German</hi> all one now, and cry <hi>Bon Campagno,</hi> Well ſaid, i'faith, anſwer'd <hi>Sancho; Bon Compagno, Perdie.</hi> And then he would burſt out a laughing for half an hour together, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt Concern for all his late Misfortunes, or the Loſs of his Government; for Anxieties uſe to have but little Power over the time that Men ſpend in Eating or Drinking. In ſhort, as their Bellies were full, their Bones deſir'd to be at Reſt, and ſo five of 'em dropp'd aſleep, only <hi>Sancho</hi> and <hi>Ricote</hi> who had indeed eat more, but drank leſs, remain'd awake, and remov'd under the Cover of a Beech at a ſmall Diſtance, where while the other ſlept, <hi>Ricote</hi> in good <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſpoke to <hi>Sancho</hi> to this Purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>Thou well knoweſt, Friend <hi>Sancho Pança,</hi> how the late Edict, that enjoyn'd all thoſe of my Nation to depart the Kingdom, alarm'd us all; at leaſt me it did; inſomuch that the Time limited for our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was not yet expir'd, but I thought the Law was ready to be executed upon me and my Children. Accordingly I reſolv'd to provide betime for their Security and mine, as a Man does that knows his
<pb n="1144" facs="tcp:54446:616"/>
Habitation will be taken away from him, and ſo ſecures another before he is oblig'd to remove. So I left our Town by my ſelf, and went to ſeek ſome Place beforehand, where I might convey my Family without expoſing my ſelf to the Inconveniency of a Hurry, like the reſt that went; for the wiſeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us were juſtly apprehenſive that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations iſſu'd out for the Baniſhment of our <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Race were not only Threats, as ſome flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd themſelves, but would certainly take Effect at the Expiration of the limited Time. I was the rather inclin'd to believe this, being conſcious that our People had very dangerous Deſigns, ſo that I could not but think the King was inſpir'd by Heaven to take ſo brave a Reſolution, and expel thoſe Snakes out of the Boſom of the Kingdom: Not that we were all guilty, for there were ſome ſound and real Chriſtians among us; but their Number was ſo ſmall, that they could not be oppos'd to thoſe that were otherwiſe, and it was not ſafe to keep Enemies within Doors. In ſhort, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary we ſhould be baniſh'd, but tho' ſome might think it a mild and pleaſant Fate, to us it ſeems the moſt dreadful Thing that could befall us: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we are, we bemoan with Tears our Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from <hi>Spain;</hi> for, after all, there we were born, and 'tis our native Country. We find no where the Entertainment our Misfortune requires, and even in <hi>Barbary</hi> and all other Parts of <hi>Africk,</hi> where we expected to have met with the beſt Reception and Relief, we find the greateſt Inhumanity and the worſt Uſage. We did not know our Happineſs till we had loſt it; and the Deſire which moſt of us have to return to <hi>Spain,</hi> is ſuch, that the greateſt Part of thoſe that ſpeak the Tongue, as I do, who are many, come back hither, and leave their Wives and Children there in a forlorne Condition; ſo ſtrong
<pb n="1145" facs="tcp:54446:616"/>
is their Love for their native Place; and now I know by Experience the Truth of the Saying; ſweet is the Love of one's Country. For my Part, having left our Town, I went into <hi>France,</hi> and though we were very well receiv'd there, yet I had a mind to ſee other Countries; and ſo paſſing through it, I travell'd into <hi>Italy,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Germany,</hi> where methought one might live with more Freedom, the Inhabitants being a good humour'd ſociable People that love to live eaſie with one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and every Body follows his own Way; for there's Liberty of Conſcience allow'd in the greateſt Part of the Country. There after I had taken a Dwelling in a Village near <hi>Augsburgh,</hi> I ſtruck in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Company of theſe Pilgrims, and got to be one of their Number, finding they were ſome of thoſe who make it their Cuſtom to go to <hi>Spain,</hi> many of 'em every Year, to viſit the Places of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, which they look upon as their <hi>Indies,</hi> and beſt Market and ſureſt Means to get Money. They travel almoſt the whole Kingdom over, nor is there a Village where they are not ſure to get Meat and Drink, and ſix Pence at leaſt in Money. And they manage Matters ſo well, that at the End of their Pilgrimage they commonly go off with about a hundred Crowns clear gains, which they change into Gold, and hide either in the Hollow of their Staves, or the Patches of their Cloaths, and either thus, or ſome other private Way convey it uſually into their own Country, in ſpight of all Searches at their going out of the Kingdom. Now <hi>Sancho,</hi> my Deſign in returning hither is to fetch the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that I left bury'd when I went away, which I may do with the leſs Inconveniency, by reaſon it lies in a Place quite out of the Town. That done, I intend to write or go over my ſelf from <hi>Valencia</hi> to my Wife and Daughter, who I know are in <hi>Algiers,</hi>
                           <pb n="1146" facs="tcp:54446:617"/>
and find one Way or other to get 'em over to ſome Port of <hi>France,</hi> and from thence bring 'em over into <hi>Germany,</hi> where we will ſtay, and ſee how Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence will diſpoſe of us: For I am ſure my Wife <hi>Franciſca</hi> and my Daughter are good Catholick Chriſtians; and though I can't ſay I am as much a Believer as they are, yet I have more of the Chriſtian than of the Mahometan, and make it my conſtant Prayer to the Almighty to open the Eyes of my Underſtanding, and let me know how to ſerve him. What I wonder at, is, that my Wife and Daughter ſhould rather chuſe to go for <hi>Barbary</hi> than for <hi>France,</hi> where they might have liv'd like Chriſtians.</p>
                        <p>Look you, <hi>Ricote,</hi> anſwer'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> may haps that was none of their Fault, for to my Knowledge <hi>John Tiopieyo,</hi> thy Wive's Brother took 'em along with him, and he be like being a rank <hi>Moor,</hi> would go where he thought beſt. And I muſt tell thee further, Friend, that I doubt thou'lt loſe thy Labour in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to look after thy hidden Treaſure; for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port was hot among us, that thy Brother-in-law and thy Wife had a great many Pearls, and a deal of Gold taken away from 'em, which ſhould have been interr'd. That may be, reply'd <hi>Ricote,</hi> but I am ſure, Friend of mine, they have not met with my Hoard. For I never would tell 'em where I had hid it, for fear of the worſt. And therefore if thou wilt go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with me, and help me carry off this Money, I will give thee two hundred Crowns, to make thee eaſier in the World; Thou know'ſt I can tell 'tis but low with thee. I would do it, anſwer'd <hi>Sancho;</hi> but I an't at all covetous. Were I in the leaſt given to it, this Morning I quitted an Employment, which had I but kept, I might have got enough to have made the Walls of my Houſe of beaten Gold; and before ſix Months had been at an End, I might have eaten my Victuals in Plate. So that as well for this
<pb n="1147" facs="tcp:54446:617"/>
Reaſon, as becauſe I fancy it would be a Piece of Treaſon to the King, in abetting his Enemies, I would not go with thee, though thou wouldſt lay me down twice as much. And prithee, ſaid <hi>Ricote,</hi> what Sort of an Employment is it thou haſt left? Why, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I have left the Government of an Iſland, and ſuch an Iſland as i'faith you'll ſcarce meet with the like in haſte within a Mile of an Oak. And where is this Iſland, ſaid <hi>Ricote?</hi> Where, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> why, ſome two Leagues off, and it is call'd the Iſland of <hi>Barataria.</hi> Prithee don't talk ſo, reply'd <hi>Ricote;</hi> Iſlands lie a great Way off in the Sea; there are none of 'em on the Main Land. Why not, quoth <hi>Sancho?</hi> I tell thee, Friend <hi>Ricote,</hi> I came from thence but this Morning, and Yeſterday I was there governing it at my Will and Pleaſure like any Dragon; yet for all that I e'en left it for this ſame Place of a Governour ſeem'd to me but a tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and perillous Kind of an Office. And what didſt thou get by thy Government, ask'd <hi>Ricote?</hi> Why, anſwer'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> I have got thus much Knowledge, as to underſtand that I am not fit to govern any Thing unleſs it be a Herd of Cattle; and that the Wealth that's got in theſe Kind of Governments coſts a Man a deal of Labour and Toil, Watching and Hunger; for in your Iſlands, Governours muſt eat next to nothing, eſpecially if they have Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians to look after their Health. I can make nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Head nor Tail of all this, ſaid <hi>Ricote;</hi> It ſeems to me all Madneſs; for who would be ſuch a Simpleton as to give thee Iſlands to govern? Was the World quite bare of abler Men, that they could pick out no Body elſe for a Governour? Prithee ſay no more, Man, but come to thy Senſes, and conſider whether thou wilt go along with me, and help me to carry off my hidden Wealth, my Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, for I may well give it that Name, conſidering
<pb n="1148" facs="tcp:54446:618"/>
how much there is of it, and I'll make a Man of thee as I have told thee. Hark you me, <hi>Ricote,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> I've already told thee my Mind. Let it ſuffice that I will not betray thee, and ſo a God's Name go thy Way, and let me go mine; for full well I wot, <hi>That what's honeſtly got may be loſt, but what's ill got will periſh and the Owner too.</hi> Well, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid <hi>Ricote,</hi> I'll preſs thee no further. Only prithee tell me, wert thou in the Town when my Wife and Daughter went away with my Brother-in-law? Ay marry was I, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> by the ſame Token, thy Daughter look'd ſo woundy handſome that there was old Crouding to ſee her, and every Body ſaid ſhe was the fineſt Creature o' God's Earth. She wept bitterly all the Way, poor Thing, and embrac'd all her She-Friends and Acquaintance, and begg'd all of thoſe that flock'd about her to pray for her, and that in ſo earneſt and pitious a manner, that, ſhe e'en made me ſhed Tears, though I am none of the greateſt Blubberers. Faith and Troth, many there had a good Mind to have got her away from her Uncle upon the Road, and have hid her; but the Thoughts of the King's Proclamation kept 'em in Awe. But he that ſhew'd himſelf the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, was Don <hi>Pedro de Gregorio,</hi> that young rich Heir that you know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They ſay he was up to the Ears in Love with her, and has never been ſeen in the Town ſince ſhe went. We all thought he was gone after her to ſteal her away, but hitherto we have heard no more of the Matter. I have all along had a Jealouſy, ſaid <hi>Ricote,</hi> that this Gentleman lov'd my Daughter. But I always had too good Opinion of my <hi>Ricota</hi>'s Vertue, to be uneaſie with his Paſſion; for thou know'ſt <hi>Sancho,</hi> very few, and hardly any of our Women of <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Race, ever marry'd with the old Chriſtians on the Account of Love; and ſo I hope, that my Daughter, who, I
<pb n="1149" facs="tcp:54446:618"/>
believe, minds more the Duties of a Chriſtian than any Thing of Love, will but little regard this young Heir's Courtſhip. Heaven grant ſhe may, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> for elſe 'twould be the worſe for 'em both; and now honeſt Neighbour, I muſt bid thee good b'y, for I have a Mind to be with my Maſter Don <hi>Quixote</hi> this Evening. Then Heaven be with thee, Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid <hi>Ricote:</hi> I find my Comrades have fetch'd out their Naps, and 'tis Time we ſhould make the beſt of our Way. With that, after a kind Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, <hi>Sancho</hi> mounted his <hi>Dapple, Ricote</hi> lean'd on his Staff, and ſo they parted.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>SAncho</hi> ſtaid ſo long with <hi>Ricote,</hi> that the Night overtook him within half a League of the Duke's Caſtle. It grew dark; however as it was Summer Time, he was not much uneaſy, and choſe to go out of the Road with a Deſign to ſtay there till the Morning. But as ill Luck wou'd have it, while he was ſeeking ſome Place where he might reſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he and <hi>Dapple</hi> tumbl'd of a ſudden into a very deep Hole, which was among the Ruins of ſome Old Buildings. As he was falling, he pray'd with all his Heart, fancying himſelf all the while ſinking down into the bottomleſs Pit; but he was in no ſuch Danger, for by that time he had deſcended ſomewhat lower than Eighteen Foot, <hi>Dapple</hi> made a<pb n="1150" facs="tcp:54446:619"/>
full Stop at the Bottom, and his Rider found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſtill on his Back, without the leaſt Hurt in the World. Preſently <hi>Sancho</hi> began to conſider the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his Bones, held his Breath, and felt all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, and finding himſelf ſound Wind and Limb, and in a whole Skin, he thought he could never give Heaven ſufficient Thanks for his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous Preſervation; for at firſt he gave himſelf over for loſt, and broken into a thouſand Pieces. He grop'd with both Hands about the Walls of the Pit, to try if it were poſſible to get out without Help; but he found 'em all ſo plain, and ſo ſteep, that there was not the leaſt Hold or Footing to get up. This griev'd him to the Soul, and to increaſe his Sorrow <hi>Dapple</hi> began to raiſe his Voice in a very piteous and doleful Manner, which pierc'd his Maſter's very Heart; nor did the poor Beaſt make ſuch Moan without Reaſon, for, to ſay the Truth, he was but in a woeful Condition. Woe's me, cry'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> what ſudden and unthought of Miſchances every Foot befall us poor Wretches that live in this miſerable World! Who wou'd have thought that he, who but Yeſterday ſaw himſelf ſeated in the Throne of an Iſland Governour, and had Servants and Vaſſals at his Beck, ſhou'd to Day find himſelf buried in a Pit, without the leaſt Soul to help him, or come to his Relief! Here we are like to periſh with deadly Hunger, I and my Aſs, if we don't die before, he of his Bruiſes, and I of Grief and Anguiſh. At leaſt, I ſhan't be ſo lucky as was my Maſter Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> when he went down into the Cave of the Inchanter <hi>Monteſinos.</hi> He found better Fare there than he cou'd have at his own Houſe, the Cloth was laid, and his Bed made, and he ſaw nothing but pleaſant Viſions: But I am like to ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing here but Toads and Snakes. Unhappy Creature that I am! What have my fooliſh Deſigns and Whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
<pb n="1151" facs="tcp:54446:619"/>
brought me to? If ever 'tis Heaven's bleſſed Will that my Bones be found, they'll be taken out of this diſmal Place bare, white and ſmooth, and thoſe of my poor <hi>Dapple</hi> with 'em, by which, perhaps, it will be known who we are, at leaſt, by thoſe who ſhall have taken notice that <hi>Sancho Pança</hi> never ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from his Aſs, nor his Aſs from <hi>Sancho Pança.</hi> Unhappy Creatures that we are, I ſay again? Had we dy'd at Home among our Friends, tho' we had miſs'd of Relief, we ſhou'd not have wanted Pity, and ſome to cloſe our Eyes at the laſt Gaſp. Oh my dear Companion and Friend, ſaid he to his Aſs, how ill have I requited thy faithful Services. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me, and Pray to Fortune the beſt thou can'ſt to deliver us out of this Plunge, and I here promiſe thee to ſet a Crown of Lawrel on thy Head, that thou may'ſt be taken for no leſs than a Poet Laureat, and thy Allowance of Provender ſhall be doubl'd. Thus <hi>Sancho</hi> bewail'd his Misfortune, and his Aſs hearken'd to what he ſaid, but anſwer'd not a Word, ſo great was the Grief and Anguiſh which the poor Creature endur'd at the ſame Time.</p>
                        <p>At length, after a whole Night's Lamenting, and complaining at a miſerable Rate, the Day came on, and its Light having confirm'd <hi>Sancho</hi> in his Doubts of the Impoſſibity of getting out of that Place with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Help, he ſet up his Throat again, and made a vigorous Outcry, to try whether any Body might not hear him. But alas, all his Calling was in vain, for all a-round there was no Body within hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and then he gave himſelf over for Dead and Buried. He caſt his Eyes on <hi>Dapple,</hi> and ſeeing him extended on the Ground, and ſadly down in the Mouth, he went to him, and try'd to get him on his Legs, which with much a-do, by means of his Aſſiſtance, the poor Beaſt did at laſt, being hardly able to ſtand. Then he took a Luncheon of
<pb n="1152" facs="tcp:54446:620"/>
Bread out of his Wallet, that had run the ſame Fortune with 'em, and giving it to the Aſs, who took it not at all amiſs, and made no Bones of it, here ſaid <hi>Sancho,</hi> as if the Beaſt had underſtood him, a fat Sorrow is better than a lean. At length, he perceiv'd on one Side of the Pit a great Hole wide enough for a Man to creep through ſtooping: He drew to it, and having crawl'd thro' on all Four, found that it led into a Vault that enlarg'd it ſelf the further it extended, which he could eaſily perceive the Sun ſhining in towards the Top of the Concavity. Having made this Diſcovery, he went back to his Aſs, and like one that knew what belong'd to Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, with a Stone, began to remove the Earth that was about the Hole, and labour'd ſo effectually, that he ſoon made a Paſſage for his Companion. Then taking him by the Halter, he led him along fair and ſoftly through the Cave, to try if he cou'd not find a Way to get out on the other Side. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he went in the Dark, and ſometimes without Light, but never without Fear. Heaven defend me, ſaid he to himſelf, what a Heart of a Chicken have I! This now, which to me is a ſad Diſaſter, to my Maſter, Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> wou'd be a rare Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture. He wou'd look upon theſe Caves and Dungeons as lovely Gardens, and glorious Palaces, and hope to be led out of theſe dark narrow Cells into ſome fine Meadow; while I, luckleſs, helpleſs, heartleſs Wretch that I am, every Step I take, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to ſink into ſome deeper Pit than this, and go down I don't know whither. Welcome ill Luck when it comes alone. Thus he went on, lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deſpairing, and thought he had gone ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more than half a League, when, at laſt he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a Kind of a confus'd Light, like that of Day breaking in at ſome open Place, but which to poor
<pb n="1153" facs="tcp:54446:620"/>
                           <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſeem'd a Proſpect of a Paſſage into another World.</p>
                        <p>But here <hi>Cid Hamet Benengeli</hi> leaves him a while, and returns to Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> who entertain'd and pleas'd himſelf with the Hopes of a ſpeedy Combat between him and the Dishonourer of Donna <hi>Rodri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guez</hi>'s Daughter, whoſe Wrongs he deſign'd to ſee redreſs'd on the appointed Day.</p>
                        <p>It happen'd one Morning, as he was riding out to prepare and exerciſe againſt the Time of Battle, as he was practiſing with <hi>Roſinante,</hi> the Horſe in the Middle of his Manage pitch'd his Feet near the Brink of a deep Cave; inſomuch that if Don <hi>Quixote</hi> had not us'd the beſt of his Skill, he muſt infallibly have tumbl'd into it. Having ſcap'd that Danger, he was tempted to look into the Cave without alighting, and wheeling about, rode up to it. Now while he was ſatisfying his Curioſity, and ſeriouſly muſing, he thought he heard a Noiſe within, and there upon liſt'ning, he could diſtinguiſh theſe Words, which in a doleful Tone aroſe out of the Cavern; Ho! above there! Is there no good Chriſtian that hears me, no charitable Knight or Gentleman that will take Pity of a Sinner buried alive, a poor Governour without a Government. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> fancy'd he heard <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Voice, which did not a little ſurpriſe him, and for his better Satisfaction, raiſing his Voice as much as he cou'd, Who's that below, cry'd he? Who's that complains? Who ſhou'd it be, to his Sorrow, cry'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> but the moſt wretched Soul alive, <hi>Sancho Pança,</hi> Governour, for his Sins, and his Ill Errantry, of the Iſland of <hi>Barataria,</hi> formerly Squire to the famous Knight. Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha?</hi> Theſe Words redoubl'd Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, and encreas'd his Amazement; for he preſently imagin'd that <hi>Sancho</hi> was dead, and that his Soul was there doing Penance. Poſſeſs'd with
<pb n="1154" facs="tcp:54446:621"/>
that Fancy, I conjure thee, ſaid he, by all that can conjure thee, as I am a Catholick Chriſtian, to tell me who thou art, and, if thou art a Soul in Pain, let me know what thou would'ſt have me do for thee; for ſince my Profeſſion obliges me to aſſiſt and ſuccour all that are afflicted in this World, certainly it will make me relieve and help the needy in the other World, who cannot help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Surely, Sir, anſwer'd he from below, you that ſpeak to me ſhould be my Maſter Don <hi>Quixote:</hi> By the Tone of your Voice it can be no Man elſe. My Name is Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> reply'd the Knight, and I think it my Duty to aſſiſt not only the Living but the Dead in their Neceſſities. Tell me then who thou art, thou who fill'ſt me with Aſtoniſhment; for if thou art my Squire, <hi>Sancho Pança,</hi> and dead, if the Devil have not got thee, and through Heaven's Mercy thou art in Purgatory, our Holy Mother, the Roman-Catholick Church, has ſufficient Suffrages to redeem thee from the Pains thou endur'ſt, and I my ſelf will ſollicite her on thy behalf as far as my Eſtate will go; therefore proceed, and tell me quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly who thou art? Why then, reply'd the Voice, by whatever you'll have me ſwear by, I make Oath that I am <hi>Sancho Pança,</hi> your Squire, and that I never was dead yet in my Life. But only having left my Government, for Reaſons and Cauſes which I han't Leiſure yet to tell you, laſt Night unluckily I fell into this Cave, where I am ſtill, and <hi>Dapple</hi> with me, that will not let me tell a Lye; for as a further Proof of what I ſay, he is here. Now what's ſtrange, immediately, as if the Aſs had underſtood what his Maſter ſaid, to back his Evidence, he fell a Braying ſo obſtreperouſly that he made the whole Cave ring again. A notable Witneſs, cry'd Don <hi>Quixote!</hi> I know this Bray, as if I were the Parent of it, and I own thy Voice, my <hi>Sancho.</hi> I ſee thou
<pb n="1155" facs="tcp:54446:621"/>
art my real Squire; ſtay therefore till I go to the Caſtle, which is hard by, and fetch more Company to help thee cut of the Pit into which thy Sins doubtleſs have thrown thee. Make haſte, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> and for Heaven's ſake come again as faſt as you can, for I can no longer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to be here buried alive, and I am e'en dying with Fear.</p>
                        <p>Don <hi>Quixote</hi> went with all Speed to the Caſtle, and gave the Duke and Dutcheſs an Account of <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Accident, whilſt they did not a little wonder at it, though they conceiv'd he might eaſily e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough fall in at the Mouth of the Cave, which had been there Time out of Mind. But they were mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurpriz'd to hear he had abdicated his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before they had an Account of his coming away.</p>
                        <p>In ſhort, they ſent Ropes, and other Conveniencies by their Servants to draw him out, and at laſt with much Trouble and Labour, both he and his <hi>Dapple</hi> were reſtor'd from that gloomy Pit, to the full En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the Light of the Sun. At the ſame Time a certain Scholar ſtanding by, and ſeeing him hois'd up; juſt ſo, ſaid he, ſhou'd all bad Governours come out of their Governments; juſt as this Wretch is dragg'd out of this profound Abyſs, pale, half ſtarv'd, famiſh'd, and, as I fancy, without a Croſs in his Pocket. Hark you, Goodman Slander, reply'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> 'tis now eight or ten Days ſince I began to govern the Iſland that was given me, and in all that Time I never had my Belly full but once; Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians have perſecuted me, Enemies have trampl'd over me, and bruis'd my Bones, and I have had neither Leiſure to take Bribes, nor to receive my juſt Dues. Now all this conſider'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in my Opinion I did not deſerve to come out in this Faſſion? But Man appoints, and God diſappoints. Heaven
<pb n="1156" facs="tcp:54446:622"/>
knows beſt what's beſt for us all. We muſt take Time as it comes, and our Lot as it falls. Let no Man ſay, I'll drink no more of this Water; we count our Chickens before they are hatch'd, and many go out for Wool and come home ſhorn. Heaven knows my Mind, and I ſay no more, tho' I might. Ne'er trouble thy ſelf, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> nor mind what ſome will ſay, for then thou wilt never have done. So thy Conſcience be clear, let the World talk at random, as it uſes to do. One may as ſoon tye up the Winds as the Tongues of Slanderers. If a Governour returns rich from his Government, they ſay he has fleec'd and robb'd the People; if poor, then they call him idle Fool, and ill Husband. Nothing ſo ſure, then, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but this Bout they'll call me a ſhallow Fool, but for a Fleecer or a Robber I ſcorn their Words, I defy all the World. Thus diſcourſing as they went, with a Rabble of Boys and Idle People about 'em, they at laſt got to the Caſtle, where the Duke and the Dutcheſs waited in the Gallery for the Knight and Squire. As for <hi>Sancho,</hi> he wou'd not go up to ſee the Duke, till he had ſeen his Aſs in the Stable, and provided for him; for he ſaid the poor Beaſt had but ſorry Entertainment in his laſt Night's Lodging: This done, away he went to wait on his Lord and Lady, and throwing himſelf on his Knees, My Lord and Lady, ſaid he, I went to govern your Iſland of <hi>Barataria,</hi> ſuch being your Will and Pleaſure, tho' 'twas your Goodneſs more than my Deſert. Naked I enter'd into it, and naked I came away, I neither won nor loſt. Whether I govern'd well or ill, there are thoſe not far off can tell, and let them tell, if they pleaſe, that can tell better than I. I have reſolv'd doubtful Caſes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd Law-Suits, and all the while ready to die with Hunger, ſuch was the Pleaſure of Doctor <hi>Pedro
<pb n="1157" facs="tcp:54446:622"/>
Rezio</hi> of <hi>Tirte a fuera,</hi> that Phyſician in ordinary to Iſland Governours. Enemies ſet upon us in the Night, and after they had put us in great Danger, the People of the Iſland ſay they were deliver'd, and had the Victory by the Strength of my Arm, and may Heaven proſper 'em as they ſpeak Truth, ſay I. In ſhort, in that Time, I experienc'd all the Cares and Burthens this Trade of Governing brings along with it, and I found 'em too heavy for my Shoulders. I was never cut out for a Ruler, and I am too clumſy to meddle with Edge-Tools, and ſo before the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment left me, I e'en reſolv'd to leave the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and accordingly Yeſterday Morning I quitted the Iſland as I found it, with the ſame Streets, the ſame Houſes, and the ſame Roofs to them as when I came into it. I have ask'd for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by way of Lone, and made no Hoard againſt a rainy Day. I deſign'd indeed to have iſſu'd out ſeveral wholeſome Orders, but did not, for fear they ſhou'd not be kept, in which Caſe it ſignifies no more to make 'em than if one made 'em not. So, as I ſaid before, I came away from the Iſland with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Company but my <hi>Dapple.</hi> I fell into a Cave, and went a good Way through it, till this Morning by the Light of the Sun, I ſpy'd the Way out, yet not ſo eaſy, but that had not Heaven ſent my Maſter Don <hi>Quixote</hi> to help me, there I might have ſtaid till Doom's day. And now, my Lord Duke, and my Lady Dutcheſs, here's your Governour <hi>Sancho Pança</hi> again, who by a ten Days Government has only pick'd up ſo much Experience as to know he would not give a Straw to be Governour, not only of an Iſland, but of the verſal World. This being allow'd, kiſſing your Honours Hands, and doing like the Boys when the Play at <hi>Truſſe</hi> or <hi>faile,</hi> who cry, Leap you, and then let me Leap; ſo I leap from the Government to my old Maſter's Service
<pb n="1158" facs="tcp:54446:623"/>
again. For after all, tho' with him I often eat my Bread in bodily Fear, yet ſtill I fill my Belly; and, for my Part, ſo I have but that well ſtuff'd, no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whether it be with Carrots or with Partridge.</p>
                        <p>Thus <hi>Sancho</hi> concluded his long Speech, and Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> who all the while dreaded he would have ſaid a Thouſand Impertinencies, thank'd Heaven in his Heart, finding him end with ſo few. The Duke embrac'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> and told him, he was very ſorry he had quitted his Government ſo ſoon, but that he would give him ſome other Employment that ſhould be leſs troubleſome, and more profitable. The Dutcheſs was no leſs kind, giving Order he ſhould want for nothing, for he ſeem'd ſadly bruis'd and out of Order.</p>

                        <p>THE Duke and Dutcheſs were not ſorry that the Interlude of <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Government had been play'd, eſpecially when the Steward, who came that very Day, gave 'em a full and diſtinct Account of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Thing the Governour had done and ſaid, during his Adminiſtration, uſing his very Expreſſions, and repeating almoſt every Word he had ſpoke, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding with a Deſcription of the Storming of the
<pb n="1159" facs="tcp:54446:623"/>
Iſland, and <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Fear and Abdication, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no unacceptable Entertainment.</p>
                        <p>And now the Hiſtory relates, that the Day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the Combate was come, nor had the Duke forgot to give his Lacquey <hi>Toſilos</hi> all requiſite Inſtructions how to vanquiſh Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and yet neither kill nor wound him; to which Purpoſe he gave order that the Spears or Steelheads of their Lances ſhould be taken off, making Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that Chriſtianity, for which he had ſo great a Veneration, did not admit that ſuch Conflicts ſhould ſo much endanger the Lives of the Combatants, and that it was enough he granted him free Liſts in his Territories, though it was againſt the Decree of the Holy Council, which forbids ſuch Challenges; for which Reaſons he deſir'd him not to puſh the Thing to the utmoſt Rigour. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> reply'd, that his Grace had the ſole Dipoſal of all Things, and it was only his Duty to obey.</p>
                        <p>And now the dreadful Day being come, the Duke caus'd a ſpacious Scaffold to be erected for the Judges of the Field of Battel, and for the Matron and her Daughter, the Plantiffs.</p>
                        <p>An infinite Number of People flock'd from all the Neighbouring Towns and Villages to behold this wonderful new Kind of Combate, the like to which had never been ſeen or ſo much as heard of in thoſe Parts, either by the Living or the Dead. The firſt that made his Entrance at the Barriers, was the Marſhal of the Field, who came to ſurvey the Ground, and rode all over it, that there might be no foul Play, no private Holes, or Contrivance to make one ſtumble or fall. After that, enter'd the Matron and her Daughter, who ſeated themſelves in their Places, all in deep Mourning, their Vails cloſe to their Eyes, and over their Breaſts, with no ſmall Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Sorrow.

Field appeared the peerleſs Champion, Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha:</hi> A while after, at the other enter'd the grand Lacquey, <hi>Toſilos,</hi> attended with a great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Trumpets, and mounted on a mighty Steed, that ſhook the very Earth. The Viſor of his Helmet was down, and he was armed Cap-a-pee, in ſhining Armour of Proof. His Courſer was a Flea-bitten Horſe, that ſeem'd of <hi>Friezland</hi> Breed, and had a Quantity of Wooll about each of his Fetlocke's. The valorous Combatant came on, well tutor'd by the Duke his Maſter how to behave himſelf towards the valorous Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha;</hi> being warn'd to ſpare his Life by all Means, and therefore to avoid a Shock in his firſt Career that might otherwiſe prove fatal, ſhould he encounter him directly: <hi>Toſilos</hi> fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Compaſs about the Barrier, and at laſt made a Stop right againſt the two Women, caſting a leering Eye upon her that had demanded him in Marriage. Then the Marſhal of the Field call'd to Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and in the Preſence of <hi>Toſilos</hi> ask'd the Mother and the Daughter whether they conſented that Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote de la Mancha</hi> ſhould vindicate their Right, and whether they would ſtand or fall by the Fortune of their Champion? They ſaid they did, and allow'd of whatever he ſhould do in their behalf, as good and valid. The Duke and Dutcheſs by this Time were ſeated in a Gallery that was over the Barriers, which were ſurrounded by a vaſt Throng of Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators, all waiting to ſee the unmerciful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallelled Conflict. The Conditions of the Combat were theſe, That if Don <hi>Quixote</hi> were the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, his Opponent ſhould marry <hi>Donna Rodri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guez</hi>'s Daughter; but if the Knight were overcome, then the Victor ſhould be diſcharg'd from his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and not bound to give her any other Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. Then the Marſhal of the Field placed each of them on the Spot whence they ſhould ſtart, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
<pb n="1161" facs="tcp:54446:624"/>
equally between them the Advantage of the Ground, that neither of them might have the Sun in his Eyes. And now the Drums beat, and the Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor of the Trumpets reſounded through the Air; the Earth ſhook under 'em, and the Hearts of the numerous Spectators were in Suſpence, ſome fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, others expecting the good or bad Iſſue of the Battle. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> recommending himſelf with all his Soul to Heaven and his Lady <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo,</hi> ſtood expecting when the preciſe Signal for the On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet ſhould be given—But our Lacquey's Mind was otherwiſe employ'd, and all his Thoughts were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what I am going to tell you.</p>
                        <p>It ſeems, as he ſtood looking on his Female Enemy, ſhe appear'd to him the moſt beautiful Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man he had ever ſeen in his whole Life; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perceiv'd by the little blind Archer, to whom the World gives the Name of Love, he took his Advantage, and fond of improving his Triumphs, though it were but over the Soul of a Lacquey, he came up to him ſoftly, and without being perceiv'd by any one, he ſhot an Arrow two Yards long into the poor Footmans Side ſo ſmartly, that his Heart was pierc'd through and through. A Thing which the miſchievous Boy cou'd eaſily do; for Love is inviſible, and has free Ingreſs or Egreſs where he pleaſes, at a moſt unaccountable Rate. You muſt know then, that when the Signal for the Onſet was given, our Lacquey was in an Extaſie, tranſported with the Thoughts of the Beauty of his lovely Enemy, inſomuch that he took no manner of Notice of the Trumpet's Sound; quite contrary to Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> who no ſooner heard it, but clapping Spurs to his Horſe, he began to make towards his Enemy with <hi>Roſinante</hi>'s beſt Speed At the ſame Time his good Squire <hi>Sancho Pança</hi> ſeeing him ſtart, Heaven be thy Guide, cry'd he aloud, thou Cream and
<pb n="1162" facs="tcp:54446:625"/>
Flower of Chivalry-Errant, Heaven give thee the Victory, ſince thou haſt Right on thy Side. <hi>Toſilos</hi> ſaw Don <hi>Quixote</hi> coming towards him, yet inſtead of taking his Career to encounter him; without leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Place, he call'd as loud as he cou'd to the Marſhal of the Field, who thereupon rode up to him to ſee what he would have. Sir, ſaid <hi>Toſilos,</hi> is not this Duel to be fought that I may marry yonder young Lady, or let it alone? Yes, anſwer'd the Marſhal. Why then, ſaid the Lacquey, I feel a Burden upon my Conſcience, and am ſenſible I ſhould have a great deal to anſwer for, ſhou'd I proceed any further in this Combate; and therefore I yield my ſelf vanquiſh'd, and deſire I may marry the Lady this Moment. The Marſhal of the Field was ſurpriz'd, and, as he was privy to the Duke's Contrivance of that Buſineſs, the Lacquey's unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Submiſſion put him to ſuch a Nonplus, that he knew not what to anſwer. On the other Side, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ſtopt in the Middle of his Career, ſeeing his Adverſary did not put himſelf in a Poſture of Defence. The Duke cou'd not imagine why the Buſineſs of the Field was at a Stand, but the Marſhal having inform'd him, he was amaz'd, and in a great Paſſion. In the mean Time, <hi>Toſilos</hi> approaching Donna <hi>Rodriguez,</hi> Madam, cry'd he, I am willing to marry your Daughter, there's no need of Law-Suits, nor of Combats in the Matter, I had rather make an End of it peaceably, and without the Hazard of Body and Soul. Why then, ſaid the valorous Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> hearing this, ſince 'tis ſo I am diſcharg'd of my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; let them e'en marry a God's Name, and Heaven bleſs 'em, and give 'em Joy. At the ſame Time the Duke coming down within the Liſts, and applying himſelf to <hi>Toſilos,</hi> Tell me Knight, ſaid he, is it true, that you yield without Fighting, and that at the Inſtigation of your timerous Conſcience,
<pb n="1163" facs="tcp:54446:625"/>
you are reſolv'd to marry this Damſel? Yes, an't pleaſe your Grace, anſwer'd <hi>Toſilos.</hi> Marry, and I think 'tis the wiſeſt Courſe, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> for what ſays the Proverb, what the Mouſe wou'd get, give the Cat, and keep thy ſelf out of Trouble. In the mean while <hi>Toſilos</hi> began to unlace his Helmet, and call'd out that ſomebody might help him off with it quickly, as being ſo choak'd with his Armour, that he was ſcarce able to breathe. With that, they took off his Helmet with all Speed, and then the Lacquey's Face was plainly diſcover'd. Donna <hi>Rodriguez</hi> and her Daughter perceiving it preſently, a Cheat, a Cheat, cry'd they! They have got <hi>Toſilos,</hi> my Lord Duke's Lacquey to counterfeit my lawful Husband, Juſtice of Heaven and the King. This is a Piece of Malice and Treachery not to be endur'd. Ladies, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> don't vex your ſelves, there's neither Malice nor Treachery in the Caſe, or if there be, the Duke is not in the Fault. No, thoſe evil mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Negromancers that Perſecute me, are the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, who envying the Glory I ſhould have got by this Combat, have transform'd the Face of my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary into this, which you ſee is the Duke's Lacquey. But take my Advice, Madam, added he to the Daughter, and in ſpight of the Baſeneſs of my Enemies, marry him; for I dare engage 'tis the very Man you claim as your Husband. The Duke hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, angry as he was, cou'd hardly forbear loſing all his Indignation in Laughter. Truly, ſaid he, ſo many extraordinary Accidents every Day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal the great Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> that I am inclinable to believe this is not my Lacquey, tho' he appears to be ſo. But for our better Satisfaction, let us defer the Marriage but a Fortnight, and in the mean While keep in cloſe Cuſtody this Perſon that has put us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Confuſion; perhaps by that Time he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume his former Looks, for doubtleſs the Malice of
<pb n="1164" facs="tcp:54446:626"/>
theſe miſchievous Magicians againſt the Noble Don <hi>Quixote</hi> cannot laſt ſo long, eſpecially when they find all theſe Tricks and Transformations ſo little avail. Alack a day! Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> thoſe plaguy Imps of the Devil are not ſo ſoon tir'd as you think for; where my Maſter is concern'd, they us'd to form and deform, and chop and change this into that, and that into t'other. 'Tis but a While ago that they tranſmography'd the <hi>Knight of the Mirrors,</hi> whom he had overcome, into a ſpecial Acquaintance of ours, the Batchelor <hi>Sampſon Carraſco</hi> of our Village; and as for the Lady <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo,</hi> our Miſtreſs, they have bewitch'd and be-devill'd her into the Shape of a meer Country-Blouze, and ſo I verily think this ſaucy Fellow here is like to dye a Footman, and will live a Footman all the Days of his Life. Well, cry'd the Daughter, let him be what he will, if he'll have me, I'll have him. I ought to thank him, for I had rather be a Lacquey's Wife, than a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's caſt-off Miſtreſs; beſides, he that deluded me is no Gentleman neither. To be ſhort, the Sum of the Matter was, that <hi>Toſilos</hi> ſhou'd be confin'd to ſee what his Tranformation wou'd come to. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was proclaim'd Victor by general Conſent; and the People went away, moſt of 'em very much out of Humour, becauſe the Combatants had not cut one another to pieces to make 'em Sport; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Cuſtom of the young Rabble, to be ſorry, when, after they have ſtaid in hopes to ſee a Man hang'd, he happens to be pardon'd, either by the Party he had wrong'd, or the Magiſtrate. The Croud being diſpers'd, the Duke and Dutcheſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd with Don <hi>Quixote</hi> into the Caſtle, <hi>Toſilos</hi> was ſecur'd, and kept cloſe: As for Donna <hi>Rodriguez</hi> and her Daughter, they were very well pleas'd to ſee one Way or other that Buſineſs wou'd end in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage;
<pb n="1165" facs="tcp:54446:626"/>
and <hi>Toſilos</hi> flatter'd himſelf with the like Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. LVII.</hi> How Don <hi>Quixote</hi> took his Leave of the Duke, and what paſs'd between him and the witty wanton <hi>Altiſidora</hi> the Dutcheſs's Damſel.</head>
                        <p>DON <hi>Quixote</hi> thought it now Time to leave the idle Life he led in the Caſtle, believing it a mighty Fault, thus to ſhut himſelf up, and indulge his ſenſual Appetite among the tempting Varieties of Dainties and Delights, which the Lord and Lady of the Place provided for his Entertainment, as a Knight-Errant; and he thought he was to give a ſtrict Account to Heaven for a Courſe of Life ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to his active Profeſſion. Accordingly one Day he acquainted the Duke and Dutcheſs with his Sentiments, and begg'd their Leave to depart. They both ſeem'd very unwilling to part with him, but yet at laſt yielded to his Entreaties. The Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs gave <hi>Sancho</hi> his Wife's Letters, which he could not hear read without weeping. Who would have thought, cry'd he, that all the mighty Hopes with which my Wife ſwell'd her ſelf up at the News of my Preferment, ſhould come to this at laſt, and now I ſhould be reduc'd again to trot after my Maſter Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> in Search of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and broken Bones! However, I am glad to ſee my <hi>Tereſa</hi> was like her ſelf, in ſending the Dutcheſs the Acorns; which if ſhe had not done, ſhe had ſhew'd her ſelf a dirty ungrateful Sow, and I ſhould
<pb n="1166" facs="tcp:54446:627"/>
have been confounded mad with her. My Comfort is, that no Man can ſay the Preſent was a Bribe; for I had my Government before ſhe ſent it, and 'tis fit thoſe who have a Kindneſs done 'em ſhould ſhew themſelves grateful, tho' it be with a ſmall Matter. In ſhort, naked I came into the Government, and naked I went out of it; and ſo I may ſay for my Comfort with a ſafe Conſcience, naked I came into ſhe World, and naked I am ſtill; I neither won nor loſt, and that's no eaſie Matter as Times go, let me tell you. Theſe were <hi>Sanho</hi>'s Sentiments at his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.</p>
                        <p>Don <hi>Quixote</hi> having taken his ſolemn Leave of the Duke and Dutcheſs over night, left his Apartment the next Morning, and appear'd in his Armour in the Court-yard, the Galleries all round about being fill'd at the ſame Time with the People of the Houſe; the Duke and Dutcheſs being alſo got thither to ſee him: <hi>Sancho</hi> was upon his <hi>Dapple</hi> with his Cloak-bag, his Wallet and his Proviſion, very brisk and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; for the Steward that acted the Part of <hi>Trifaldi</hi> had given him a Purſe with two hundred Crowns in Gold, to defray Expences, which was more than Don <hi>Quixote</hi> knew at that Time. And now while e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Body look'd to ſee 'em ſet forward, on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the arch and witty <hi>Altiſidora</hi> ſtarted from the reſt of the Dutcheſs's Damſels and Attendance that ſtood by among the reſt, and in a doleful Tone, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd her ſelf to him in the following Doggrel Rhimes.</p>

                        <p>Thus <hi>Altiſidora</hi> expreſs'd her Reſentments, and Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> who look'd on her ſeriouſly all the while, would not anſwer a Word; but turning to <hi>Sancho,</hi> Dear <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid he, by the Memory of thy Fore-Fathers, I conjure thee to tell me one Truth. Say, haſt thou any Night-Coifs or Garters that belong to this Love-ſick Damſel? The three Night-Coifs I have quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> but as for the Garters, I know no more of 'em than the Man in the Moon. The Dutcheſs being wholly a Stranger to this Part of <hi>Altiſidora</hi>'s Frolick, was amaz'd to ſee her proceed ſo far in it, though ſhe knew her to be of an arch and merry Diſpoſition. But the Duke being pleas'd with the Humour, reſolv'd to carry it on. Thereupon addreſſing himſelf to Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> Truly, Sir Knight, ſaid he, I do not take it kindly, that after ſuch civil Entertainment as you have had here in my Caſtle, you ſhould offer to carry away three Night-Coifs, if not a pair of Garters beſides, the proper Goods and Chattels of this Damſel here preſent. This was not done like a Gentleman, and does not make good the Character you would maintain in the World: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſtore her Garters, or I challenge you to a Mortal Combate, without being afraid that your evil-minded Inchanters ſhould alter my Face, as they
<pb n="1171" facs="tcp:54446:629"/>
did my Footman's. Heaven forbid, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> that I ſhould draw my Sword againſt your moſt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Perſon, to whom I ſtand indebted for ſo many Favours. No, my Lord, as for the Night-Coifs I will cauſe 'em to be reſtor'd, for <hi>Sancho</hi> tells me he has 'em; but as for the Garters 'tis impoſſible, for neither he nor I ever had 'em; and if this Damſel of yours will look carefully among her Things, I dare ſay ſhe'll find 'em. I never was a Pilferer, my Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and while Heav'n forſakes me not, I never ſhall be guilty of ſuch Baſeneſs. But this Damſel, as you may perceive, talks like one that is in Love, and accuſes me of that whereof I am innocent; ſo that not regarding her little Revenge, I have no need to ask Pardon either of her or your Grace. I only beg you'll be pleas'd to entertain a better Opinion of me, and once more permit me to depart. Farewell, Noble Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> ſaid the Dutcheſs; may Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſo direct your Courſe, that we may always be bleſs'd with the good News of your Exploits; and ſo Heaven be with you, for the longer you ſtay the more you encreaſe the Flames in the Hearts of the Damſels that gaze on you. As for this young in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet Creature, I'll take her to task ſo ſeverely, ſhe ſhall not misbehave her ſelf ſo much as in a Word or Look for the future. One Word more, I beſeech you, O valorous Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> cry'd <hi>Al iſidora.</hi> I beg your Pardon for ſaying you had ſtoln my Garters, for i' my Conſcience I have 'em on: But my Thoughts ran a Wool-gathering; and I did like the Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who look'd for his Aſs while he was mounted on his Back. Many come up, cry'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> whom did they take me for, trow? A Concealer of ſtolen Goods, no indeed; had I been given that Way, I might have had Opportunities enough in my Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>

                        <p>DON <hi>Quixote</hi> no ſooner breath'd the Air in the open Field, free from <hi>Altiſidora</hi>'s amorous Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, but he fancy'd himſelf in his own Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; he thought he felt the Spirit of Knight-Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantry reviving in his Breaſt; and turning to <hi>Sancho,</hi> Liberty, ſaid he, Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> is one of the moſt valuable Bleſſings that Heaven has beſtow'd on Mankind. Not all the Treaſures conceal'd in the Bowels of the Earth, nor thoſe in the Boſom of the Sea can be compar'd with it. For Liberty, a Man may, nay, ought to hazard even his Life, as well as for Honour, accounting Captivity the greateſt Miſery he can endure. I tell thee this, my <hi>Sancho,</hi> becauſe thou wert a Witneſs of the good Cheer and Plenty which we met with in the Caſtle; yet in the midſt of thoſe delicious Feaſts, among thoſe temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Diſhes, and thoſe Liquors cool'd with Snow, me thought I ſuffer'd the Extremity of Hunger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I did not enjoy them with that Freedom as if they had been my own: For the Obligations that lie upon us to make ſuitable Returns for Kindneſſes
<pb n="1173" facs="tcp:54446:630"/>
receiv'd, are Ties that will not let a generous Mind be free. Happy the Man, whom Heav'n has bleſs'd with Bread, for which he is oblig'd to thank kind Heaven alone! For all theſe fine Words, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> 'tis not proper for us to be unthankful for two hundred good Crowns in Gold, which the Duke's Steward gave me in a little Purſe, which I have here, and cheriſh in my Boſom, as a Relick againſt Neceſſity, and a comforting Cordial next my Heart againſt all Accidents For we are not like always to meet with Caſtles, where we ſhall be made much of. A Peaſecods on't! we are more like to meet with damn'd Inns, where we ſhall be rib-roaſted.</p>
                        <p>As the wandring Knight and Squire went diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of this and other Matters, they had not rid much more than a League, ere they eſpy'd about a dozen Men, who look'd like Country-Fellows ſitting at their Victuals, with their Cloaks under them, on the green Graſs, in the middle of a Meadow. Near 'em they ſaw ſeveral white Cloaths or Sheets ſpread out and laid cloſe to one another, that ſeem'd to cover ſomething. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> rod up to the People, and after he had civilly ſaluted 'em, ask'd what they had got under that Linnen? Sir, anſwer'd one of the Company, they are ſome carv'd Images that are to be ſet up at an Altar we are erecting in our Town<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> We cover 'em, leaſt they ſhould be ſullied, and carry 'em on our Shoulders for fear they ſhould be broken: If you pleaſe, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> I ſhould be glad to ſee 'em; for, conſidering the Care you take of 'em, they ſhould be Pieces of Value. Ay, marry are they, quoth another, or elſe we're damnably cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for there's ne'er an Image among 'em that does not ſtand us in more than fifty Ducats; and, that you may know I'm no Lier, do but ſtay, and you ſhall ſee with your own Eyes. With that, getting up on his Legs, and leaving his Victuals, he went and
<pb n="1174" facs="tcp:54446:631"/>
took off the cover from one of the Figures, that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to be St. <hi>George</hi> a Horſeback, and under his Feet a Serpent coil'd up, his Throat transfix'd with a Lance, with the Fierceneſs that is commonly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the Piece; and all, as they uſe to ſay, ſpick and ſpan new, and ſhining like beaten Gold. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> having ſeen the Image, This, ſaid he, was one of the beſt Knight-Errants the Divine War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare or Church-Militant ever had: His Name was Don St. <hi>George,</hi> and he was an extraordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of Damſels. What's the next? The Fellow having uncover'd it, it prov'd to be St. <hi>Martin</hi> on Horſe-back. This Knight too, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote</hi> at the firſt ſight, was one of the Chriſtian Adventurers, and I am apt to think he was more liberal than valiant; and thou may'ſt perceive it <hi>Sancho,</hi> by his dividing his Cloak with a poor Man; he gave him half, and doubtleſs 'twas Winter-time, or elſe he would have giv'n it him whole, he was ſo chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. Not ſo neither, I fancy, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but I gueſs he ſtuck to the Proverb: He that lends his Breech muſt—, you underſtand me. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ſmil'd, and deſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>'d the Men to ſhew him the next Image; which appear'd to be that of the Patron of <hi>Spain</hi> a Horſe-back, with his Sword bloody, trampl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down <hi>Moors,</hi> and treading over Heads. Ay, this is a Knight indeed, (cry'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> when he ſaw it) one of thoſe that fought in the Squadrons of the Saviour of the World: He is call'd Don <hi>San Jago, Mata-Moros,</hi> or Don St. <hi>James the Deſtroyer of the Moors,</hi> and may be thought one of the moſt valorous Saints and Profeſſors of Chivalry that the Earth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly enjoy'd, and Heaven now poſſeſſes. Then they uncover'd another Piece, which ſhew'd St. <hi>Paul</hi> falling from his Horſe, with all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances uſually expreſs'd in the Story of his Converſion, and repreſented ſo to the Life, that he look'd as if he
<pb n="1175" facs="tcp:54446:631"/>
had been anſwering the Voice that ſpoke to him from Heaven. This, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> was the greateſt Enemy the Church Militant had once, and prov'd afterwards the greateſt Defender it will ever have. In his Life a true Knight-Errant, and in his Death a ſteadfaſt Saint; an indefatigable Labourer in the Vineyard of the Lord, a Teacher of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who had Heaven for his School, and the Lord of Wiſdom for his Maſter and Inſtructer. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> perceiving there were no more Images, deſir'd the Men to cover thoſe he had ſeen: And then, my good Friends, ſaid he to 'em, I cannot but eſteem the Sight that I have had of theſe Images as a happy Omen; for theſe Saints and Knights were of the ſame Profeſſion that I follow, which is that of Arms: The Difference only lies in this Point, that they were Saints, and fought according to the Rules of holy Diſcipline; and I am a Sinner, and fight after the Manner of Men. They conquer'd Heaven by Force, for Heaven is taken by Violence; but I alas cannot yet tell what I gain by the Force of my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours! Yet were my <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo</hi> but free from her Troubles, by a happy Change in my Fortune, and an Improvement in my Underſtanding, I might perhaps take a better Courſe than I do. Heaven grant it, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> and let the Devil do his worſt.</p>
                        <p>All this while the Men wonder'd at Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Diſcourſe as well as his Figure; for they could not underſtand one Half of what he meant. So that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had made an End of their Dinner, they got up their Images, took their Leaves of Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and continu'd their Journey.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sancho</hi> remain'd full of Admiration, as if he had never known his Maſter; he wonder'd how he ſhould come to know all theſe Things; and fancy'd there was not that Hiſtory or Adventure in the
<pb n="1176" facs="tcp:54446:632"/>
World, but he had it at his Finger's Ends. Faith and Troth, Maſter of mine, quoth he, if what has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to us to Day may be call'd an Adventure, it is one of the ſweeteſt and moſt pleaſant we ever met with in all our Rambles; for we are come off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a dry-haſting, or the leaſt bodily Fear. We have not ſo much as laid our Hands upon our Weapons, nor have we beaten the Earth with our Carcaſſes; but here we be ſafe, and ſound, neither-a-dry nor a-hungry. Heaven be prais'd, that I have ſeen all this with my own Eyes! Thou ſay'ſt well, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> but I muſt tell thee, that Seaſons and Times are not always the ſame, but often take a different Courſe! and what the Vulgar call Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodings and Omens, for which there are no rational Grounds in Nature, ought only to be eſteem'd happy Encounters by the Wiſe. One of theſe ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Fools, going out of his Houſe betimes in the Morning, meets a Frier of the Bleſſed Order of St. <hi>Francis;</hi> and ſtarts as if he had met a Griffin, turns back, and runs home again. Another Wiſe-acre happens to throw down the Salt on the Table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath, and thereupon is ſadly caſt down himſelf, as if Nature were oblig'd to give Tokens of enſuing Diſaſters, by ſuch ſlight and inconſiderable Accidents as theſe. A wiſe and truly Religious Man ought never to pry into the Secrets of Heaven <hi>Scipio</hi> landing in <hi>Africa,</hi> ſtumbl'd and fell down as he leap'd a-ſhore: Preſently his Soldiers took this for an ill Omen, but he, embracing the Earth, cry'd, I have thee faſt, <hi>Africa,</hi> thou ſhalt not ſcape me. In this manner, <hi>Sancho,</hi> I think it a very happy Accident that I met theſe Images I think ſo too, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> but I would fain know why the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call upon that ſame St. <hi>James</hi> the Deſtroyer of <hi>Moors,</hi> juſt when they are going to give Battel, they cry, <hi>Saint Jago, and cloſe Spain,</hi> Pray is <hi>Spain</hi> open, that it
<pb n="1177" facs="tcp:54446:632"/>
wants to be clos'd up? What do you make of that Ceremony? Thou art a very ſimple Fellow, <hi>Sancho,</hi> anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote.</hi> Thou muſt know that Heaven gave to <hi>Spain</hi> this mighty Champion of the Red-Croſs for its Patron and Protector, eſpecially in the deſperate Engagements which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had with the <hi>Moors;</hi> and therefore they invoke him in all their martial Encounters, as their Protector; and many times he has been perſonally ſeen cutting and ſlaying, overthrowing, trampling and deſtroying the <hi>Saracen</hi> Squadrons; of which I could give thee many Examples deduc'd from authentick <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Hiſtories.</p>
                        <p>Here <hi>Sancho</hi> changing the Diſcourſe, Sir, quoth he, I can't but marvel at the Impudence of <hi>Altiſidora</hi> the Dutcheſs's Damſel. I warrant you, that ſame Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief-monger they call Love, has plaguily mawl'd her, and run her through without Mercy. They ſay he's a little blind Urchin, and yet the dark Youth, with no more Eye-ſight than a Beetle, will hit you a Heart as ſure as a Gun, and bore it through and through with his Dart, if he undertakes to ſhoot at it. However, I have heard ſay, that the Shafts of Love are blunted and beaten back by the modeſt and ſober Carriage of young Maidens. But upon this <hi>Altiſidora</hi> their Edge ſeems rather to be whetted than made blunt. You muſt obſerve, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> that Love is void of Conſideration and diſclaims the Rules of Reaſon in his Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. He is like Death, and equally affects the lofty Palaces of Kings, and the lowly Cottages of Shepherds. Where-ever he takes entire Poſſeſſion of a Soul, the firſt Thing he does, is to diſmiſs all Baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and Shame. So theſe being baniſh'd from <hi>Altiſidora</hi>'s Breaſt, ſhe confidently diſcover'd her looſe Deſires, which alas! rather fill'd me with Confuſion than Pity. Well, go to, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundedly
<pb n="1178" facs="tcp:54446:633"/>
cruel; how could you be ſo hard-hearted and ungrateful? had the poor Thing but made Love to me, I dare ſay, I ſhould have come to at the firſt Word, and have been at her Service. Beſhrew my Midriff, what a Heart of Marble, Bowels of Braſs, and Soul of Plaiſter you have! But I can't for the Blood of me imagine, what the poor Creature ſaw in your Worſhip, to make her doat on you and play the Fool at this Rate! Where the Devil was the ſparkling Appearance, the Briskneſs, the fine Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, the ſweet Face that betwich'd her? Indeed and indeed, I often ſurvey your Worſhip from the Tip of your Toe to the topmoſt hair on your Crown; and not to flatter you, I can ſee nothing in you, but what's more likely to ſcare one, than to make one fall in Love. I've heard that Beauty is the firſt and chief Thing that begets Love; now you not having any, an't like your Worſhip, I can't gueſs what the poor Soul was ſmitten with. Take notice <hi>Sancho,</hi> anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> that there are two Sorts of Beauty, the one of the Soul, and the other of the Body. That of the Soul lies and diſplays it ſelf in the Underſtanding, in Principles of Honour and Vertue, in a handſome Behaviour, in Generoſity and good Breeding; all which Qualities may be found in a Perſon not ſo accompliſh'd in outward Features. And when this Beauty, and not that of the Body, is the Object of Love, then the Aſſaults of that Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion are much more fierce, more ſurprizing and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual. Now <hi>Sancho,</hi> though I am ſenſible I am not handſome, I know at the ſame time I'm not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd; and provided an honeſt Man be poſſeſs'd of the Endowments of the Mind which I have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, and nothing appears monſtrous in him, 'tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to entitle him to the Love of a reaſonable Creature.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="1179" facs="tcp:54446:633"/>Thus diſcourſing they got into a Wood quite out of the Road, and on a ſudden Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he knew where he was, found himſelf entangl'd in ſome Nets of green Thread, that were ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs among the Trees. Not being able to imagine what it was, certainly, <hi>Sancho,</hi> cry'd he, this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture of the Nets muſt be one of the moſt unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable that can be imagin'd. Let me die now if this be not a Stratagem of the evil-minded Necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancers that haunt me, to entangle me ſo that I may not proceed, as it were, to revenge my Contempt of <hi>Altiſidora</hi>'s Addreſſes. But let 'em know, that tho' theſe Nets were Adamantine Chains, as they are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made of green Thread, and though they were ſtronger than thoſe in which the jealous God of Blackſmiths caught <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> I would break them with as much Eaſe as if they were weak Ruſhes, or fine Cotton-Yarn. With that the Knight put briskly forwards, reſolv'd to break through, and make his Words good; but in the very Moment there ſprung from behind the Trees two moſt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Shepherdeſſes, at leaſt they appear'd to be ſo by their Habits; only with this Difference, that they were richly dreſs'd in Gold Brocade. Their flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hair hung down about their Shoulders in Curls, as charming as the Sun's Golden Rays, and circl'd on their Brows with Garlands of green Bays and Red-flower-gentle interwoven. As for their Age, it ſeem'd not leſs than fifteen, nor more than eighteen Years. This unexpected Viſion dazzl'd and amaz'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſurpriz'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> made even the gazing Sun ſtop ſhort in his Career, and held the ſurpriz'd Parties a while in the ſame Suſpence and Silence; 'till at laſt one of the Shepherdeſſes opening her Coral-Lips, hold Sir, ſhe cry'd; pray do not tear thoſe Nets which we have ſpread here, not to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend you, but to divert our ſelves; and becauſe
<pb n="1180" facs="tcp:54446:634"/>
'tis likely you'll enquire, why they are ſpread here, and who we are, I ſhall tell you in few Words.</p>
                        <p>About two Leagues from this Place lies a Village, where there are many People of Quality and good Eſtates; among theſe, ſeveral have made up a Company, all of Friends, Neighbours, and Relations, to come and take their Diverſion in this Place, which is one of the moſt delightful in theſe Parts. To this purpoſe we deſign to ſet up a new <hi>Arcadia.</hi> The young Men have put on the Habit of Shepherds, and Ladies the Dreſs of Shepherdeſſes. We have got two Eclogues by Heart; one out of the famous <hi>Garcilaſſo,</hi> and the other out of <hi>Camoen</hi>'s, that moſt excellent <hi>Portugueze</hi> Poet; tho' the Truth is, we have not yet repeated them, for Yeſterday was but the firſt Day of our coming hither. We have pitch'd ſome Tents among the Trees, near the Banks of a large Brook that waters all theſe Meadows. And laſt Night we ſpread theſe Nets, to catch ſuch ſimple Birds as our Calls ſhou'd allure into the Snare. Now, Sir, if you pleaſe to afford us your Company, you ſhall be made very welcome, and handſomely enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd; for we are all diſpos'd to paſs the Time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably, and for a while baniſh Melancholy from this Place. Truly, fair Lady, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote, Actaeon</hi> cou'd not be more loſt in Admiration and Amazement, at the Sight of <hi>Diana</hi> Bathing her ſelf, than I was at the Appearance of your Beauty. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud the Deſign of your Entertainment, and return you. Thanks for your obliging Offers; aſſuring you, that if it lies in my Power to ſerve you, you may depend on my Obedience to your Commands: For my Profeſſion is the very Reverſe of Ingratitude, and aims at doing Good to all Perſons, eſpecially thoſe of your Merit and Condition; ſo that were theſe Nets ſpread over the Surface of the whole Earth, I would ſeek out a Paſſage thro' new Worlds, rather than I wou'd break the ſmalleſt Thread that conduces to
<pb n="1181" facs="tcp:54446:634"/>
your Paſtime: And that you may give ſome Credit to this ſeeming Exaggeration, know that he who makes this Promiſe is no leſs than Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> if ever ſuch a Name has reach'd your Ears. Oh, my Dear, cry'd the other Shepherdeſs, what good Fortune this is! You ſee this Gentleman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us: I muſt tell you, he is the moſt valiant, the moſt amorous, and the moſt complaiſant Perſon in the World, if the Hiſtory of his Exploits already in Print, does not deceive us. I have read it, my Dear, and I hold a Wager, that honeſt Fellow there by him is one <hi>Sancho Pança,</hi> his Squire, the moſt comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Creature that ever was. You have nick'd it, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I am that comical Creature, and that very Squire you wot of, and there's my Lord and Maſter, the ſelf-ſame hiſt'rify'd, and aforeſaid Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha.</hi> Oh pray, my Dear, ſaid the other, let us entreat him to ſtay, our Father, and our Brothers will be mightily glad of it; I have heard of his Valour, and his Merit as much as you now tell me; and what's more, they ſay he is the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and faithful Lover in the World; and that his Miſtreſs, whom they call <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo,</hi> bears the Prize from all the Beauties in <hi>Spain.</hi> 'Tis not without Juſtice, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> if your Peer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Charms do not diſpute her that Glory. But, Ladies, I beſeech ye do not endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain me; for the indiſpenſable Duties of my Profeſſion will not ſuffer me to reſt in one Place.</p>
                        <p>At the ſame Time came the Brother of one of the Shepherdeſſes, clad like a Shepherd, but in a Dreſs as ſplendid and gay as thoſe of the young Ladies. They told him that the Gentleman whom he ſaw with 'em was the valorous Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> and that other, <hi>Sancho Pança,</hi> his Squire, of whom he had read the Hiſtory. The
<pb n="1182" facs="tcp:54446:635"/>
gallant Shepherd having ſaluted him, begg'd of him ſo earneſtly to grant 'em his Company to their Tents, that Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was forc'd to comply, and go with them.</p>
                        <p>About the ſame Time the Nets were drawn and fill'd with divers little Birds, who being deceiv'd by the Colour of the Snare, fell into the Danger they wou'd have avoided. Above thirty Perſons, all gayly dreſs'd like Shepherds and Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes, got together there, and being inform'd who Don <hi>Quixote</hi> and his Squire were, they were not a little pleas'd, for they were already no Strangers to his Hiſtory. In ſhort, they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd 'em to their Tents, where they found a clean, ſumptuous, and plentiful Entertainment ready. They oblig'd the Knight to take the Place of Honour, and while they ſat at Table, there was not one that did not gaze on him, and wonder at ſo ſtrange a Figure. At laſt, the Cloath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remov'd, Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> with a great deal of Gravity, lifting up his Voice, Of all the Sins that Men commit, ſaid he, none, in my Opinion, is ſo great as Ingratitude, tho' ſome think Pride a greater; and I ground my Aſſertion on this, That Hell is ſaid to be full of the Ungrateful. Ever ſince I have had the Uſe of Reaſon, I have us'd the utmoſt Endeavours to avoid this Crime; and if I am not able to repay the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits I receive in their Kind, at leaſt I am not wanting in real Intentions of making ſuitable Returns; and if that be not ſufficient, I make my Acknowledgments as publick as I can; for he that proclaims the Kindneſſes he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, ſhews his Diſpoſition to repay 'em if he cou'd; and thoſe that receive are generally inferiour to thoſe that give. The Supreme Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="1183" facs="tcp:54446:635"/>
that is infinitely above all Things, beſtows his Bleſſings on us ſo much beyond the Capacity of all other Benefactors, that all the Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments we can make, can never hold Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with his Goodneſs. However, a thankful Mind in ſome meaſure ſupplies its Want of Power with hearty Deſires, and unfeign'd Expreſſions of a Senſe of Gratitude and Reſpect. I am in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as to the Civilities I have been treated with here; for I am unable to make an Acknowledgment equal to the Kindneſſes I have receiv'd. I ſhall therefore only offer ye what is within the narrow Limits of my own Abilities; which is, to maintain, for two whole Days together, in the Middle of the Road that leads to <hi>Saragoſa,</hi> that theſe Ladies here diſguis'd in the Habit of Shepherdeſſes, are the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt courteous Damſels in the World, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting only the peerleſs <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo,</hi> ſole Miſtreſs of my Thoughts; without Offence to all that hear me be it ſpoken.</p>
                        <p>Here <hi>Sancho,</hi> who had with an uncommon Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion all the While given Ear to his Maſter's Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thought fit to put in a Word or two. Now in the Name of Wonder, quoth he, can there be any Body in the World ſo impudent as to offer to ſwear, or but to ſay, this Maſter of mine is a Mad-man? Pray tell me, ye Gentlemen Shepherds, did you ever know any of your Country Parſons, though never ſo wiſe, or ſo good Scholards, that cou'd deliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo finely? Or is there any of your Knight-Errants, though never ſo fam'd for Proweſs, that can make ſuch an Offer as he here has done. Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote</hi> turn'd towards <hi>Sancho,</hi> and beholding him with Eyes full of fiery Indignation: Can there be any Body in the World, cry'd he, that can ſay thou art not an incorrigible Blockhead, <hi>Sancho,</hi> a Compound of Folly and Knavery, of whom Malice is no ſmall
<pb n="1184" facs="tcp:54446:636"/>
Ingredient? Who bids thee meddle with my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, Fellow, or buſy thy ſelf with my Folly or Diſcretion? Hold your ſaucy Tongue, Scoundrel! Make no Reply, but go and ſaddle <hi>Roſinante,</hi> if he is unſaddl'd, that I may immediately perform what I have offer'd; for in ſo noble and ſo juſt a Cauſe thou may'ſt reckon all thoſe who ſhall preſume to oppoſe me, ſubdu'd and overthrown. This ſaid, up he ſtarted, in a dreadful Fury, and with Marks of Anger in his Looks, to the Amazement of all the Company, who were at a loſs whether they ſhould eſteem him a Mad-man or a Man of Senſe: They endeavour'd to prevail with him to lay aſide his Challenges, telling him, they were ſufficiently aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd of his grateful Nature, without expoſing him to the Danger of ſuch Demonſtrations; and as for his Valour, they were ſo well inform'd by the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of his numerous Atchievements, that there was no need of any new Inſtance to convince 'em of it. But all theſe Repreſentations cou'd not diſſwade him from his Purpoſe; and therefore having moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Roſinante,</hi> brac'd his Shield, and graſp'd his Lance, he went and poſted himſelf in the Middle of the High-way, not far from the verdant Meadow, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by <hi>Sancho</hi> on his <hi>Dapple,</hi> and all the paſtoral Society, who were deſirous to ſee the Event of that arrogant and unaccountable Reſolution. And now the Champion having taken his Ground, made the Neighbouring-Air ring with the following Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge. O ye, whoe'er you are, Knights, Squires, a'foot, or o'Horſe-back, that now paſs, or ſhall paſs this Road within theſe two Days, know that Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> Knight-Errant, ſtays here, to aſſert and maintain, that the Nymphs, who inhabit theſe Groves and Meadows, ſurpaſs in Beauty and courteous Diſpoſition, all thoſe in the Univerſe, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aſide the Soveraign of my Soul, the Lady <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinea
<pb n="1185" facs="tcp:54446:636"/>
del Toboſo.</hi> And he that dares uphold the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, let him appear, for here I expect his coming. Twice he repeated theſe lofty Words, and twice they were repeated in vain, not being heard by any Adventurer. But his old Friend Fortune, that had a ſtrange Hand at managing his Concerns, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways mended upon it, ſhew'd him a jolly Sight, for by and by he diſcover'd on the Road a great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of People a Horſe-back, many of 'em with Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in their Hands, all trooping together very faſt. The Company that watch'd Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Motions, no ſooner ſpy'd ſuch a Squadron, driving the Duſt before 'em, but they got out of Harm's Way, not judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſafe to be ſo near Danger: And as for <hi>Sancho,</hi> he ſhelter'd himſelf behind <hi>Roſinante</hi>'s Crupper. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ſtood fix'd with an undaunted Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. When the Horſemen came near, one of the foremoſt bawling to the Champion, So hey! cry'd he! get out of the Way, and be hang'd. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's in the Fellow! Stand off, or the Bulls will tread thee to Pieces. Go to, ye Scoundrels, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> none of your Bulls can avail with me, tho' the fierceſt that ever were Fed on the Banks of <hi>Xarama.</hi> Acknowledge, Hang-dogs, all in a Body, what I have proclaim'd here to be Truth, or elſe ſtand Combat with me. But the Cow-herd had not Time to Anſwer, neither had Don <hi>Quixote</hi> any left to get out of the Way, if he had been inclin'd to it; for the Herd of Wild Bulls were preſently upon him, as they pour'd along, with ſeveral tame Cows, and a huge Company of Drivers and People that went to a Town where they were to be baited the next Day. So bearing down all before 'em, Knight and Squire, Horſe and Man, they trampl'd 'em under foot at an unmerciful Rate. There lay <hi>Sancho</hi> mawl'd, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ſtunn'd, <hi>Dapple</hi> bruis'd, and <hi>Roſinante</hi> in very indifferent Circumſtances. But for all this, after the
<pb n="1186" facs="tcp:54446:637"/>
whole Rout of Men and Beaſts were gone by, up ſtarted Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> ere he was throughly come to himſelf; and ſtaggering, and ſtumbling, falling, and getting up again, as faſt as he cou'd, he began to run after them: Stop, Scoundrels, ſtop, cry'd he aloud, ſtay, 'tis a ſingle Knight defies ye all, one who ſcorns the Humour of making a Golden Bridge for a Flying Enemy. But the haſty Travellers did not ſtop nor ſlacken their Speed for all his loud Defiance; and minded it no more than the laſt Year's Snow.</p>
                        <p>At laſt Wearineſs ſtopp'd Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> ſo that, with all his Anger, and no Proſpect of Revenge, he was forc'd to ſit down in the Road till <hi>Sancho</hi> came up to him with <hi>Roſinante</hi> and <hi>Dapple.</hi> Then the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and Man made a ſhift to remount, and aſham'd of their bad Succeſs haſten'd their Journey, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking leave of their Friends of the <hi>New Arcadia.</hi>

                        <p>A Clear Fountain, which Don <hi>Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> found among ſome verdant Trees, ſerv'd to refreſh 'em, beſmear'd with Duſt, and tir'd as they were, after the rude Encounter of the Bulls. There by the Brink, leaving <hi>Roſinante</hi> and <hi>Dapple</hi> unbridl'd and unhalter'd, to their own Liberty, the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn Adventurers ſate down. <hi>Sancho</hi> waſh'd his
<pb n="1187" facs="tcp:54446:637"/>
Mouth, and Don <hi>Quixote</hi> his Face. The Squire then went to his old Cupboard, the Wallet; and having taken out of it what he us'd to call Belly-Timber, laid it before the Knight: But Don <hi>Quixote</hi> wou'd eat nothing for pure Vexation, and <hi>Sancho</hi> durſt not begin for pure good Manners, expecting that he would firſt ſhew him the Way. However, finding him ſo wrapp'd in his Imaginations as to have no Thoughts of lifting his Hand up to his Mouth, the Squire, without letting one Word come out of his, laid aſide all Kind of good Breeding, and began to ſtuff his hungry Maw with what Bread and Cheeſe he had before him. Ear, Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> cry'd Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> repair the Decays of Nature, and ſuſtain Life, which thou haſt more Reaſon to cheriſh than I; leave me to dye abandon'd to my Sorrows, and the Violence of my Misfortunes. I was born, <hi>Sancho,</hi> to Live Dying, and thou to Dye Eating. And that thou may'ſt be convinc'd I tell thee Truth, do but reflect upon me, famous in Hiſtories, dignify'd with the Honour of the Preſs, renown'd for Feats of Arms, courteous in Behaviour, reſpected by Princes, belov'd, and importun'd by Damſels; yet after all this, when I at laſt flatter'd my ſelf with Hopes of Laurels, Triumphs and Crowns, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward merited by my valorous Atchievements, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold me trod under Foot, trampl'd like the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Dirt, Kick'd and Bruis'd by the Hoofs of vile and filthy Beaſts. The Thought dulls the Edge of my Teeth, and of my Appetite; unhinges my Jaws, benums my Hands, and ſtupifies my Senſes; and fearing more to live than to dye, I am reſolv'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to ſtarve my ſelf; though to dye with Hunger be the moſt cruel of all Deaths. So that belike, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> (without loſing any Time in Chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) you will not make good the Saying, <hi>'Tis good to dye with a full Belly?</hi> For my Part, I am not ſo ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="1188" facs="tcp:54446:638"/>
yet as to kill my ſelf. No, I am like the Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler, that ſtretches his Leather with his Teeth: I am for lengthening my Life by Eating, and I'll ſtretch it with my Grinders as far as Heaven will let it run. Faith and Troth, Maſter, there's no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Folly in this World than for a Man to deſpair, and throw the Helve after the Hatchet. Therefore take my Advice, fall to, and eat as I do, and when you have done, lye down and take a Nap; the fresh Graſs here will do as well as a Feather-bed. I dare ſay, by that Time you 'wake, you'll find your ſelf better in Body and Mind.</p>
                        <p>Don <hi>Quixote</hi> follow'd <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Counſel; for he was convinc'd the Squire ſpoke good Natural Philoſophy at that time. However, in the mean While a Thought coming into his Mind, Ah! <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid he, if thou would'ſt but do ſomething that I am now going to deſire thee, my Cares wou'd ſit more eaſy on me, and my Comfort wou'd be more certain. 'Tis only this; While, according to thy Advice, I try to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe my Thoughts with Sleep, do thou but ſtep aſide a little, and expoſing thy Back-Parts bare in the open Air, take the Reins of <hi>Roſinante</hi>'s Bridle, and give thy ſelf ſome three or four Hundred ſmart Laſhes; in Part of the three Thouſand and Odd thou art to receive to diſ-enchant <hi>Dulcinea;</hi> for, in truth, 'tis a Shame, and a very great Pity that poor Lady ſhould remain enchanted all this while, through thy Careleſſneſs and Neglect. There's a great deal to be ſaid, as to that, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> but that will keep cold, firſt let's go ſleep, and then come what will come: Heaven knows what will be done. Do you think, Sir, 'tis nothing for a Man to flogg himſelf in cold Blood? I'd have you to know, 'tis a cruel Thing, eſpecially when the Laſhes muſt light upon a Body, ſo weak and horribly lin'd within as mine is. Let my Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi> have a little Patience, one of

Don <hi>Quixote</hi> gave him Thanks, eat ſomething, and <hi>Sancho</hi> a great deal; and then both betook themſelves to their Reſt; leaving thoſe two conſtant Friends and Companions, <hi>Roſinante</hi> and <hi>Dap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> to their own Diſcretion, to repoſe or feed at Random on the Paſture that abounded in that Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.</p>
                        <p>The Day was now far gone when the Knight and the Squire wak'd; they mounted, and held on their Journey, making the beſt of their Way to an Inn, that ſeem'd to be about a League diſtant. I call it an Inn, becauſe Don <hi>Quixote</hi> himſelf call'd it ſo, contrary to his Cuſtom, it being a common Thing with him to take Inns for Caſtles.</p>
                        <p>Being got thither, they ask'd the Inn-keeper whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had got any Lodging? Yes, anſwer'd he, and as good Accommodation as you'd wiſh to find in the City of <hi>Saragoſa.</hi> They alighted, and <hi>Sancho</hi> laid his Baggage in a Chamber, of which the Landlord gave him the Key; and after he had ſeen <hi>Roſinante</hi> and <hi>Dapple</hi> well provided for in the Stable, he went to wait on his Maſter, whom he found ſitting upon a Seat made in the Wall, the Squire bleſſing himſelf more than once, that the Knight had not taken the Inn for a Caſtle. Supper-time approaching, Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> retir'd to his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, and <hi>Sancho</hi> ſtaying with the Hoſt, ask'd him what he had to give 'em for Supper? What you will, anſwer'd he, you may pick and chuſe, Fiſh or Fleſh, Butcher's Meat or Poultry, Wild-Fowl, and what not? Whatever Land, Sea, and Air afford for Food, 'tis but ask and have, every

As for Chickens, reply'd the Inn-keeper, truly we have none; for the Kites have devour'd 'em. Why then, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> Roaſt us a good handſome Pullet with Eggs, ſo it be young and tender. A Pullet, Maſter, anſwer'd the Hoſt? Faith and Troth, I ſent above fifty Yeſterday to the City to ſell; but ſetting aſide Pullets, you may have any Thing elſe. Why then, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> e'en give us a good Joynt of Veal or Kid: Cry Mercy, reply'd the Inn-keeper, now I remember me, we have none left in the Houſe, the laſt Company that went, clear'd me quite; but by next Week we ſhall have to ſpare. We are finely holp'd up, quoth <hi>Sancho!</hi> Now will I hold a good Wager, all theſe Defects muſt be made up with a Diſh of Eggs and Bacon. Hey day, cry'd the Hoſt, my Gueſt has a rare Knack at gueſſing e'faith, I told him I had no Hens nor Pullets in the Houſe, and yet he wou'd have me to have Eggs! Think on ſomething elſe, I beſeech you, and let's talk no more of that. Body of me, cry'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> let's come to ſomething; tell me what thou haſt, good Mr. Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord, and don't put me to trouble my Brains any longer. Why then, d'ye ſee, quoth the Hoſt, to deal plainly with you, I have a delicate Pair of Cow-heels that look like Calves-Feet, or a Pair of Calves Feet that look like Cow-heels, dreſs'd with Onions, Peaſe and Bacon; a Diſh for a Prince, they are juſt ready to be taken off, and by this Time they cry, come eat me, come eat me. Cow-heels, cry'd <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho!</hi> I ſet my Mark upon 'em. Let no body touch 'em. I'll give more for 'em than any other ſhall. There's nothing I love better. No body elſe ſhall

have 'em, anſwer'd the Hoſt; you need not fear, for all the Gueſts I have in the Houſe beſides your ſelves are Perſons of Quality, that carry their Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, their Cook, and their Proviſions along with 'em. As for Quality, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> my Maſter's a Perſon of as good Quality, as the proudeſt he of 'em all, an' you go to that; but his Profeſſion allows of no Larders nor Butteries. We commonly clap us down in the Midſt of a Field, and fill our Bellies with Acorns or Medlars. This was the Diſcourſe that paſs'd betwixt <hi>Sancho</hi> and the Inn-keeper; for as to the Hoſt's Interrogatories, concerning his Maſter's Profeſſion, <hi>Sancho</hi> was not then at Leiſure to make him any Anſwer.</p>
                        <p>In ſhort, Supper-time came, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> went to his Room, the Hoſt brought the Diſh of Cow-heels, ſuch as it was, and ſat him down fairly to Supper.—But at the ſame Time, in the next Room, which was divided from that where they were, by a ſlender Partition, the Knight overheard Somebody talking. Dear Don <hi>Jeronimo,</hi> ſaid the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen Perſon, I beſeech you, 'till Supper's brought in, let us read another Chapter of the Second Part of Don <hi>Quixote.</hi> The Champion no ſooner heard him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf nam'd, but up he ſtarted, and liſten'd with at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive Ears to what was ſaid of him, and then he heard that Don <hi>Jeronimo</hi> anſwer, Why wou'd you have us read Nonſenſe, Senior Don <hi>John?</hi> Methinks any one that has read the firſt Part of Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> ſhou'd take but little Delight in reading the Second. That may be, reply'd Don <hi>John,</hi> however, it mayn't be amiſs to read it; for there is no Book ſo bad, as not to have ſomething that's good in it. What diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſes me moſt in this Part, is, that it repreſents Don <hi>Quixote</hi> no longer in Love with <hi>Dulcinea del To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſo.</hi> Upon theſe Words, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> burning with Anger and Indignation, cry'd out, Whoever ſays
<pb n="1192" facs="tcp:54446:640"/>
that Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha</hi> has forgot, or can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo,</hi> I will make him know with equal Arms, that he deviates wholly from the Truth; for the peerleſs <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo</hi> cannot be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, nor can Don <hi>Quixote</hi> be guilty of Forgetfulneſs. <hi>Conſtancy</hi> is his Motto; and to preſerve his Fidelity with Pleaſure, and without the leaſt Conſtraint, is his Profeſſion. Who's that anſwers us? crys one of thoſe in the next Room: Who ſhould it be, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha</hi> his nown ſelf, the ſame that will make good all he has ſaid, and all that he has to ſay, take my Word for't: For a good Pay-maſter ne'er grudges to give Security.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sancho</hi> had no ſooner made that Anſwer, but in came the two Gentlemen (for they appear'd to be no leſs) and one of 'em throwing his Arms about Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Neck, Your Preſence, Sir Knight, ſaid he, does not belye your Reputation, nor can your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation fail to raiſe a Reſpect for your Preſence. You are certainly the true Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> the North-Star, and Luminary of Chivalry-Errant, in deſpight of him that has attempted to uſurp your Name, and annihilate your Atchievements, as the<note n="*" place="margin">An <hi>Arragonian</hi> publiſh'd a Book, which he call'd the Second Part of Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> before our Author had printed this. See the Preface of this Second Part, and the Account of <hi>Cervantes</hi>'s Life.</note> Author of this Book, which I here deliver into your Hand, has preſum'd to do. With that, he took the Book from his Friend, and gave it to Don <hi>Quixote.</hi> The Knight took it, and without ſaying a Word, began to turn over the Leaves; and then returning it a while after; in the little I have ſeen, ſaid he, I have found three Things that deſerve Reprehenſion.
<pb n="1193" facs="tcp:54446:640"/>
Firſt I find fault with ſome Words in this Preface. In the ſecond Place, his Language is <hi>Arragonian,</hi> for ſometimes he writes without Articles; and the third Thing I have obſerv'd, which betrays moſt his Ignorance, is he's out of the Way in one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Parts of the Hiſtory: For there he ſays, that the Wife of my Squire <hi>Sancho Panſa</hi> is call'd <hi>Mary Gutierrez,</hi> which is not true; for her Name is <hi>Tereſa Panſa;</hi> and he that errs in ſo conſiderable a Paſſage, may well be ſuſpected to have committed many groſs Errors through the whole Hiſtory. A pretty impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Fellow, is this ſame <hi>Hiſtory</hi> writer, cry'd <hi>Sancho!</hi> Sure he knows much what belongs to our Concerns, to call my Wife <hi>Tereſa Panſa, Mary Gutierrez!</hi> Pray take the Book again, an't like your Worſhip, and ſee whether he ſays any thing of me, and whether he has not chang'd my Name too. Sure, by what you've ſaid, honeſt Man, ſaid Don <hi>Jeronimo,</hi> you ſhou'd be <hi>Sancho Pança,</hi> Squire to Senior Don <hi>Quixote?</hi> So I am, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> and I am proud of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Well, ſaid the Gentleman, to tell you Truth, the laſt Author does not treat you ſo civilly as you ſeem to deſerve. He repreſents you as a Glutton and a Fool, without the leaſt Grain of Wit or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and very different from the <hi>Sancho</hi> we have in the firſt Part of your Maſter's Hiſtory. Heaven forgive him, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> he might have left me where I was, without offering to meddle with me. Every Man's Noſe won't make a Shooeing-Horn. Let's leave the World as it is. St. <hi>Peter</hi> is very well at <hi>Rome.</hi> Preſently the two Gentlemen invited Don <hi>Quixote</hi> to ſup with 'em in their Chamber; for they knew there was nothing to be got in the Inn fit for his Entertainment. Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> who was always very complaiſant, cou'd not deny their Requeſt, and went with 'em. So <hi>Sancho</hi> remain'd Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, with his Fleſh-Pot before him, and plac'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="1194" facs="tcp:54446:641"/>
at the Upper-End of the Table, with the Inn-keeper for his Meſs-Mate; for he was no leſs a Lover of Cow-Heels than the Squire.</p>
                        <p>While Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was at Supper with the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, Don <hi>John</hi> ask'd him when he had heard of the Lady <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo?</hi> Whether ſhe were married? Whether ſhe had any Children, or were with Child or no? Or whether continuing ſtill in her Maiden State, and preſerving her Honour and Reputation unſtain'd, ſhe had a grateful Senſe of the Love and Conſtancy of Signior Don <hi>Quixote? Dulcinea</hi> is ſtill a Virgin, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and my amorous Thoughts more fix'd than ever; our Correſpondence after the old Rate, not frequent, but her Beauty transform'd into the homely Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a Female Ruſtick. And with that, he told the Gentlemen the whole Story of her being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted, what had befallen him in the Cave of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſinos,</hi> and the Means that the ſage <hi>Merlin</hi> had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd to free her from Enchantment, which was <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Penance of three Thouſand three Hundred Laſhes. The Gentlemen were extremely pleas'd to hear ftom Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s own Mouth the ſtrange Paſſages of his Hiſtory, equally wondring at the Nature of his Extravagancies, and his elegant Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of relating 'em. One Minute they look'd upon him to be in his Senſes, and the next, they thought he had loſt 'em all; ſo that they cou'd not reſolve what Degree to aſſign him between Madneſs and ſound Judgment.</p>
                        <p>By this Time <hi>Sancho</hi> having eat his Supper, and left his Landlord, mov'd to the Room where his Maſter was with the two Strangers, and as he bolted in, Hang me, quoth he, Gentlemen, if he that made the Book your Worſhips have ſeen, cou'd have a Mind that he and I ſhou'd ever take a loving Cup together: I wiſh, as he calls me Greedy-gut, he does not ſet me out for a Drunkard too. Nay, ſaid Don
<pb n="1195" facs="tcp:54446:641"/>
                           <hi>Jeronimo,</hi> he does not uſe you better as to that Point; though I cannot well remember his Expreſſions. Only this I know, they are ſcandalous and falſe, as I perceive by the Phyſiognomy of ſober <hi>Sancho</hi> here preſent. Take my Word for't, Gentlemen, quoth the Squire, the <hi>Sancho</hi> and the Don <hi>Quixote</hi> in your Book, I don't know who they be, but they are not the ſame Men as thoſe in <hi>Cid Hamet Benengeli</hi>'s Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, for we two are they, juſt ſuch as <hi>Benengeli</hi> makes us; my Maſter valiant, diſcreet, and in Love, and I a plain, merry-conceited Fellow, but neither a Glutton, nor a Drunkard. I believe you, ſaid Don <hi>John,</hi> and I could wiſh, were ſuch a Thing poſſible, that all other Writers whatſoever were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to record the Deeds of the great Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote,</hi> except <hi>Cid Hamet,</hi> his firſt Author; as <hi>Alexander</hi> did forbid all other Painters to draw his Picture except <hi>Apelles.</hi> Let any one draw mine, if he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> but let him not abuſe the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal; for when Patience is loaded with Injuries, many times it ſinks under its Burden. No Injury, reply'd Don <hi>John,</hi> can be offer'd to Signior Don <hi>Quixote</hi> but what he is able to revenge, or at leaſt, ward off with the Shield of his Patience, which, in my Opinion, is great and ſtrong.</p>
                        <p>In ſuch Diſcourſe they ſpent a good Part of the Night, and though Don <hi>John</hi> endeavour'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade Don <hi>Quixote</hi> to read more of the Book, to ſee how the Author had handl'd his Subject, he cou'd by no means prevail with him, the Knight giving him to underſtand, he had enough of it, and as much as if he had read it throughout, concluding it to be all of a Piece, and Nonſenſe all over; and that he would not encourage the Scribbler's Vanity ſo far, as to let him think he had read it, ſhou'd it ever come to his Ears that the Book had fallen into his Hands; well knowing we ought to avoid defiling our Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
<pb n="1196" facs="tcp:54446:642"/>
and with the niceſt Care, our Eyes, with vile and obſcene Matters.</p>
                        <p>They ask'd him which Way he was travelling; he told 'em he was going for <hi>Saragoſa,</hi> to make one at the Tournaments held in that City once a Year, for the Prize of Armour. Don <hi>John</hi> acquainted him, that the pretended ſecond Part of his Hiſtory gave an Account how Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> whoever he was, had been at <hi>Saragoſa</hi> at a publick running at the Ring, the Deſcription of which was wretched and defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive in the Contrivance, mean and low in the Style and Expreſſion, and miſerably poor in Devices, and in other Show, but all made up of fooliſh idle Stuff. For that Reaſon, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> I will not ſet a Foot in <hi>Saragoſa,</hi> and ſo the World ſhall ſee what a notorious Lye this new Hiſtorian is guilty of, and all Mankind ſhall perceive I am not the Don <hi>Quixote</hi> he ſpeaks of. You will do very well, ſaid Don <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronimo;</hi> beſides there is another Tournament at <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celona,</hi> where you may ſignalize your Valour. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to do ſo, reply'd Don <hi>Quixote:</hi> And ſo Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, give me Leave to bid you good Night, and permit me to go to Bed (for 'tis Time;) and pray place me in the Number of your beſt Friends, and moſt faithful Servants. And me too, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> for mayhap you may find me good for ſomething.</p>
                        <p>Having taken Leave of one another, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> retir'd to their Chamber, leaving the two Strangers in Admiration to think what a Medley the Knight had made of good Senſe and Extravagance: Both fully ſatisfied however, that theſe two Perſons were the true Don <hi>Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho,</hi> and not thoſe obtruded upon the Publick by the <hi>Arragonian</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</p>
                        <p>Early in the Morning Don <hi>Quixote</hi> got up, and knocking at the thin Wall that parted his Chamber from that of the Gentlemen, he took his Leave of 'em
<pb n="1197" facs="tcp:54446:642"/>
                           <hi>Sancho</hi> pay'd the Hoſt nobly, but advis'd him either to keep better Proviſion in his Inn, or to commend it leſs.</p>

                        <p>THE Morning was cool, and ſeem'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe a temperate Day, when Don <hi>Quixote</hi> left the Inn, having firſt inform'd himſelf, which was the readieſt Way to <hi>Barcelona;</hi> for he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd he would not ſo much as ſee <hi>Saragoſa,</hi> that he might prove that new Author a Lier, who (as he was told) had ſo miſrepreſented him in the pretended ſecond Part of his Hiſtory. For the Space of ſix Days he travell'd, without meeting any Adventure worthy of Memory; but the ſeventh, having loſt his Way, and being overtaken by the Night, he was oblig'd to ſtop in a Thicket, either of Oaks or Cork-trees; for in this <hi>Cid Hamet</hi> does not obſerve the ſame Punctuality he has kept in other Matters. There both Maſter and Man diſmounted, and laying themſelves down at the Foot of the Trees; <hi>Sancho,</hi> who had handſomely fill'd his Belly that Day, eaſily reſign'd himſelf into the Arms of Sleep. But Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> whom his Chimera's kept awake much more than Hunger, could not ſo much as cloſe his Eyes; his working Thought being hurry'd to a thouſand ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Places. This Time he fancy'd himſelf in <hi>Monteſino</hi>'s Cave, fancy'd he ſaw his <hi>Dulcinea</hi> (perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as ſhe was into a Country-Hoyden) jump at a
<pb n="1198" facs="tcp:54446:643"/>
ſingle Leap upon her Aſs-Colt. The next Moment he thought he heard the ſage <hi>Merlin</hi>'s Voice, heard him in awful Words relate the Means requir'd to effect her Diſ inchantment. Preſently a Fit of Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair ſeiz'd him: He was ſtark mad to think on <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi>'s Remiſneſs and Want of Charity; the Squire having not given himſelf above five Laſhes, a ſmall and inconſiderable Number in proportion to the Quantity of the Penance ſtill behind. This Reflection ſo nettl'd him, and ſo aggravated his Vexation, that he could not forbear thinking on ſome extraordinary Methods. If <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, thought he, when he could not untie the <hi>Gordian</hi> Knot, ſaid, 'tis the ſame Thing to cut, or to undoe, and ſo ſlaſh'd it aſunder, and yet became the Soveraign of the World, why may not I free <hi>Dulcinea</hi> from Inchantment, by whipping <hi>Sancho</hi> my ſelf, whether he will or no? For if the Condition of this Remedy conſiſt in <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi>'s receiving three thouſand and odd Laſhes, what does it ſignify to me, whether he gives himſelf thoſe Blows, or another gives 'em him, ſince the Streſs lies upon his receiving 'em, by what means ſoever they are given? Full of that Conceit he came up to <hi>Sancho,</hi> having firſt taken the Reins of <hi>Roſinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te</hi>'s Bridle, and fitted 'em to his Purpoſe of laſhing him with 'em. He then began to untruſs <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Points, and 'tis a receiv'd Opinion, he had but one that was us'd before, and held up his Breeches; but he no ſooner fell to work, but <hi>Sancho</hi> ſtarted out of his Sleep, and was throughly awake in an Inſtant. What's here, cry'd he? Who's that fumbles about me, and untruſſes my Points? 'Tis I, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote,</hi> I am come to repair thy Negligence, and to ſeek the Remedy of my Torments. I come to whip thee, <hi>Sancho,</hi> and to diſcharge, in Part at leaſt, that Debt for which thou ſtand'ſt engag'd. <hi>Dulcinea</hi> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, while thou liveſt careleſs of her Fate, and I
<pb n="1199" facs="tcp:54446:643"/>
die with Deſire. Untruſs therefore freely and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly: For I am reſolv'd, while we are here alone in this Receſs, to give thee at leaſt two Thouſand Stripes.</p>
                        <p>Hold you there, quoth <hi>Sancho.</hi> Pray be quiet, will you. Body of me, let me alone, or I proteſt deaf Men ſhall hear us. The Jirks I'm bound to give my ſelf are to be voluntary, and not forc'd; and at this Time I have no Mind to be whipp'd at all: Let it ſuffice that I promiſe you to firk and ſcourge my ſelf, when the Humour takes me. No, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> there's no ſtanding to thy Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſy, <hi>Sancho;</hi> for thou art hard-hearted; and, tho' a Clown, yet thou art tender of thy Fleſh; and ſo ſaying, he ſtrove with all his Force to untie the Squire's Points. Which, when <hi>Sancho</hi> perceiv'd, he ſtarted up on his Legs, and ſetting upon his Maſter, clos'd with him, tripp'd up his Heels, threw him fairly upon his Back; and then ſet his Knee upon his Breaſt, and held his Hands faſt, ſo that he could hardly ſtir, or fetch his Breath. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd thus, cry'd, How now Traitor! What, rebel againſt thy Maſter, againſt thy natural Lord, againſt him that gives thee Bread! I neither marr King, nor make King, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I do but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend my ſelf, that am Lord of my ſelf. If your Worſhip will promiſe to let me alone, and give over the Thoughts of Whipping me at this Time, I'll let you riſe, and will leave you at Liberty; if not, here thou dy'ſt, Traytor to Donna <hi>Sancha</hi> Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote</hi> gave his Parole of Honour, and ſwore by the life of his beſt Thoughts, not to touch ſo much as a Hair of <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Coat, but entirely to leave it to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion to whip himſelf when he thought fit. With that, <hi>Sancho</hi> got up from him, and remov'd his Quarters to another Place at a good Diſtance, but as he went to lean againſt another Tree, he perceiv'd
<pb n="1200" facs="tcp:54446:644"/>
Something bobbing at his Head, and, lifting up his Hands, found it to be a Man's Feet with Shoes and Stockings on Quaking for fear, he mov'd off to another Tree, where the like impending Horrour dangl'd over his Head. Straight he call'd out to Don <hi>Quixote</hi> for Help. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> came, and inquiring into the Occaſion of his Fright, <hi>Sancho</hi> anſwer'd, that all thoſe Trees were full of Men's Feet and Legs. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> began to ſearch and grope about, and falling preſently into the Account of the Buſineſs, fear nothing, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid he, there's no Danger at all; for what thou feel'ſt in the dark are certainly the Feet and Legs of ſome Banditti and Robbers, that have been hang'd up on theſe Trees; for here the Officers of Juſtice hang 'em up by twenties and thirties in Cluſters, by which I ſuppoſe we cannot be far from <hi>Barcelona;</hi> and indeed he gueſs'd right.</p>
                        <p>And now Day breaking, they look'd up, and plainly diſcern'd the Bodies of the High-way-men hanging on the Trees: But if the dead ſurpriz'd 'em, how much more were they diſturb'd at the Appearance of above forty live Banditti, who pour'd upon 'em, and ſurrounded 'em on a ſudden, charging 'em in the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talan</hi> Tongue, to ſtand till their Captain came.</p>
                        <p>Don <hi>Quixote</hi> found himſelf on Foot, his Horſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridl'd, his Launce againſt a Tree at ſome Diſtance, and in ſhort, void of all Defence; and therefore he was forc'd to put his Arms a-croſs, hold down his Head, and ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="1201" facs="tcp:54446:644"/>
ſearch'd and ſurvey'd him all over, and would have had the Gold, tho' they had ſtripp'd him of his Skin to come at it. But by good Fortune their Captain came in the Interim. He ſeem'd about four and thirty Years of Age, his Body robuſt, his Stature tall, his Viſage auſtere, and his Complexion ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. He was mounted on a luſty Horſe, wore a Coat of Steel, and no leſs than two Piſtols on each Side. Perceiving that his Squires (for ſo they call Men of that Profeſſion in thoſe Parts) were going to ſtrip <hi>Sancho,</hi> he order'd 'em to forbear, and was inſtantly obey'd, by which means the Girdle eſcap'd. He wonder'd to ſee a Launce rear'd up againſt a Tree, a Shield on the Ground, and Don <hi>Quixote</hi> in Armour and penſive, with the ſaddeſt melancholick Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance that Sadneſs it ſelf could frame Coming up to him, be not ſo ſad, honeſt Man, ſaid he; you have not fall'n into the Hands of ſome cruel <hi>Buſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

I am not ſad, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> for having fall'n into thy Power, valorous <hi>Roque,</hi> whoſe boundleſs Fame ſpreads thro' the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, but for having been ſo remiſs as to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd by thy Soldiers with my Horſe unbridl'd, whereas, according to the Order of Chivalry-Errant, which I profeſs, I am oblig'd to live always upon my Guard, and at all Hours be my own Centinel; for let me tell thee, great <hi>Roque,</hi> had they met me mounted on my Steed, arm'd with my Shield and Launce, they would have found it no eaſy Task to make me yield; for, know I am Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> the ſame whoſe Exploits are celebrated through all the habitable Globe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Roque Guinart</hi> found out immediately Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s blind Side, and judg'd there was more Madneſs than Valour in the Caſe: Now, though he had ſeveral Times heard him mention'd in Diſcourſe, he could
<pb n="1202" facs="tcp:54446:645"/>
never believe what was related of him to be true, nor could he be perſwaded that ſuch a Humour ſhould reign in any Man; for which Reaſon he was very glad to have met him, that Experience might convince him of the Truth. Therefore addreſſing himſelf to him, Valorous Knight, ſaid he, vex not your ſelf, nor tax Fortune with Unkindneſs, for it may happen, that what you look upon now as a ſad Accident may redound to your Advantage; for Heaven, by ſtrange and unaccountable Ways, beyond the Reach of humane Imagination, uſes to raiſe up thoſe that are fall'n, and fill the Poor with Riches, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was going to return him Thanks, when from behind 'em they heard a Noiſe like the tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of ſeveral Horſes, though it was occaſion'd but by one, on which came full ſpeed a Perſon that look'd like a young Gentleman, about twenty Years of Age. He was clad in green Damask edg'd with Gold Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loon ſuitable to his Waſtecoat, a Hat turn'd up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, ſtraight Wax'd-leather Boots, his Spurs, Sword and Dagger gilt, a light Birding-piece in his Hand, and a Caſe of Piſtols before him. <hi>Roque</hi> having turn'd his Head at the Noiſe, diſcover'd the handſome Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition, which approaching nearer ſpoke to him in this manner.</p>
                        <p>You are the Gentleman I look'd for, valiant <hi>Roque;</hi> for with you I may perhaps find ſome Comfort, though not a Remedy in my Affliction. In ſhort, not to hold you in Suſpence (for I am ſenſible you don't know me) I'll tell you who I am. My Name is <hi>Claudia Jeronima;</hi> I am the Daughter of your parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Friend <hi>Simon Forte,</hi> ſworn Foe to <hi>Clauquel Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rellas,</hi> who is alſo your Enemy, being one of your adverſe Faction. You already know, this <hi>Torrellas</hi> had a Son whom they call Don <hi>Vincente Torrellas,</hi> at leaſt he was call'd ſo within theſe two Hours. That Son of his, to be ſhort in my ſad Story, I'll tell you
<pb n="1203" facs="tcp:54446:645"/>
in four Words what Sorrow he has brought me to. He ſaw me, courted me, was heard, and was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd. Our Amour was carried on with ſo much Secrecy that my Father knew nothing of it; for there is no Woman, though ever ſo retir'd and cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly look'd to, but can find Time enough to compaſs and fulfil her unruly Deſires. In ſhort, he made me a Promiſe of Marriage, and I the like to him, but without proceeding any further. Now Yeſterday I underſtood, that, forgetting his Engagements to me, he was going to wed another, and that they were to be marry'd this Morning; a Piece of News that quite diſtracted me, and made me loſe all Patience. Therefore, my Father being out of Town, I took the Opportunity of equipping my ſelf as you ſee, and by the Speed of this Horſe overtook Don <hi>Vincente</hi> about a League hence, where, without urging my Wrongs, or ſtaying to hear his Excuſes, I fir'd at him, not only with this Piece, but with both my Piſtols, and, as I believe, ſhot him through the Body, thus with his Heart's-Blood waſhing away the Stains of my Honour. This done, there I left him to his Servants, who neither dar'd nor could prevent the ſudden Execution; and came to ſeek your Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that by your Means I may be conducted into <hi>France,</hi> where I have Relations to entertain me; and withal to beg of you to defend my Father from Don <hi>Vincente</hi>'s Party, who might otherwiſe revenge his Death upon our Family.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Roque</hi> admiring at once the Reſolution, agreeable Deportment, and handſome Figure of the beautiful <hi>Claudia;</hi> come, Madam, ſaid he, let us firſt be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford of your Enemy's Death, and then conſider what is to be done for you. Hold, cry'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> who had hearken'd with great Attention to all this Diſcourſe, none of ye need trouble your ſelves with this Affair; the Defence of the Lady is my Province.
<pb n="1204" facs="tcp:54446:646"/>
Give me my Horſe and Arms, and ſtay for me here, I will go and find out this Knight, and, dead or alive, force him to perform his Obligations to ſo great a Beauty. Ay, ay, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> you may take his Word for't; my Maſter has a rare Stroke at mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Matches: 'Tis but t'other Day he made a young Rogue yield to marry a Maid whom he would have left in the Lurch, after he was promis'd to her; and had it not been for the Inchanters, that plague his Worſhip, who tranſmogrify'd the Bridegroom into a Footman, and broke off the Match, the ſaid Maid had been none by this Time.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Roque</hi> was ſo much taken up with the Thoughts of <hi>Claudia</hi>'s Adventure, that he little minded either Maſter or Man; but ordering his Squires to reſtore what they had taken from <hi>Dapple</hi> to <hi>Sancho,</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to the Place where they had quarter'd the Night before, he went off upon the Spur with <hi>Claudia,</hi> to find the expiring Don <hi>Vincente.</hi> They got to the Place where <hi>Claudia</hi> met him, and found nothing but the Marks of Blood newly ſpilt; but looking round about 'em; they diſcover'd a Company of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at a Diſtance on the Side of a Hill, and preſently judg'd 'em to be Don <hi>Vincente</hi> carry'd by his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants either to his Cure or Burial.

The Servants were ſtartl'd at the Appearance of <hi>Roque,</hi> and <hi>Claudia</hi> was troubl'd at the Sight of Don <hi>Vincente,</hi> and divided between Anger and Compaſſion, had you given me this, and made good your Promiſe, (ſaid ſhe to him, laying hold of his Hand) you had never brought

Oh my unfortunate Husband, whoſe ſincere Love and Fidelity to me have thus for his nuptial Bed brought him to the cold Grave! Thus the poor Lady went on in ſo ſad and moving a Strain, that even <hi>Roque</hi>'s rugged Temper now melted into Tears, which on all Occaſions had ſtill been Strangers to his Eyes. The Servants wept and lamented, <hi>Claudia</hi> relaps'd into her Swooning as faſt as they found means to bring her to Life again; and the whole Appearance was a moſt moving Scene of Sorrow. At laſt <hi>Roque Guinart</hi> bid Don <hi>Vincente</hi>'s Servants carry his Body to his Father's Houſe, which was not far diſtant, in order to have it buried. <hi>Claudia</hi> commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to <hi>Roque</hi> her Reſolution of retiring into a Monaſtery, where an Aunt of hers was Abbeſs, there to ſpend the reſt of her Life, wedded to a better and an immortal Bridegroom. He commended her pious Reſolution, offering to conduct her whither ſhe pleas'd, and to protect her Father and Family from all Aſſaults and Practices of their moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Enemies. <hi>Claudia</hi> made a modeſt Excuſe for declining his Company, and took Leave of him weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Don <hi>Vincente</hi>'s Servants carry'd off the dead Body, and <hi>Roque</hi> return'd to his Men. Thus ended <hi>Claudia Jeronima</hi>'s Amour, brought to ſo lamentable a Cataſtrophe by the prevailing Force of a cruel and deſperate Jealouſie.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Roque Guinart</hi> found his Crew where he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and Don <hi>Quixote</hi> in the Middle of 'em, mounted on <hi>Roſinante,</hi> and declaiming very copiouſly againſt their Way of living, at once dangerous to their Bodies, and deſtructive to their Souls; but his Auditory being chiefly compos'd of <hi>Gaſcoigns,</hi> a wild unruly Kind of People, all his Morality was thrown away upon 'em. <hi>Roque</hi> upon his Arrival ask'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> if they had reſtor'd him all his Things; every Thing, Sir, anſwer'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> but three Night-Caps, that are
<pb n="1207" facs="tcp:54446:647"/>
worth a King's Ranſome. What ſays the Fellow, cry'd one of the Robbers? Here they be, and they are not worth three Sices. As to the intrinſick Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, reply'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> they may be worth no more, but 'tis the Merit of the Perſon that gave 'em me that raiſes their Value to that Price.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Roque</hi> order'd 'em to be reſtor'd immediately; and commanding his Men to draw up in a Line, he caus'd all the Cloaths, Jewels, Money, and all the other Booty they had got ſince the laſt Repartition, to be brought before him; then readily appraiſing every particular and reducing into Money what could not be divided, he caſts up the Account of the Whole, and then makes a juſt Dividend into Parts, paying to every Man his exact and due Proportion with ſo much Prudence and Equity, that he fail'd not in the leaſt Point of diſtributive Juſtice. The Booty thus ſhar'd to the general Satisfaction; if it were not for this punctual Management (ſaid <hi>Roque,</hi> turning to Don <hi>Quixote</hi>) there would be no living among us. Well, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> Juſtice muſt needs be a good Thing, and the old Proverb ſtill holds good, Thieves are never Rogues among themſelves. One of the Banditti over-hearing him, cock'd his Gun, and would certainly have ſhot him through the Head, had not the Captain commanded him to hold. Poor <hi>Sancho</hi> was ſtruck as mute as a Fiſh, and reſolv'd not to open his Lips once more, till he got into better Company.</p>
                        <p>By this, came one or two of their Scouts that lay <hi>perdu</hi> on the Road, and inform'd their Captain, that they had diſcover'd a great Company of Travellers on the way to <hi>Barcelona.</hi> Are they ſuch as we look for, ask'd <hi>Roque,</hi> or ſuch as look for us? Such as we look for, Sir, anſwer'd the Fellow: Away then, cry'd <hi>Roque,</hi> all of ye, my Boys, and bring 'em me hither ſtraight, let none eſcape. The Squires preſently
<pb n="1208" facs="tcp:54446:648"/>
obey'd the Word of Command, and left Don <hi>Quixote, Roque</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> to wait their Return. In the mean Time <hi>Roque</hi> entertain'd the Knight with ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on his Way of Living. I ſhould not wonder, ſaid he, Senior Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> that our Life ſhould appear to you a reſtleſs Complication of Hazards and Diſquiets; for 'tis no more than what daily Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience has made me ſenſible of. You muſt know, that this Barbarity and auſtere Behaviour which I affect to ſhew, is a pure Force upon my Nature; being urg'd to this Extremity by the Reſentment of ſome ſevere Injuries, which I could not put up without a ſatisfactory Revenge, and now I am in, I muſt go through; one Sin draws on another, in ſpight of my better Deſigns; and I am now involv'd in ſuch a Chain of Wrongs, Factious, Abettors, and Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that no leſs than the Divine Power of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence can free me from this Maze of Confuſions. Nevertheleſs I deſpair not ſtill of a ſucceſsful End of my Misfortunes.</p>
                        <p>Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> being ſurpriz'd to hear ſuch ſound Senſe and ſober Reflection come from one whoſe diſorderly Profeſſion was ſo oppoſite to Diſcretion and Politeneſs; Senior <hi>Roque,</hi> ſaid he, 'tis a great Step to Health for a Man to underſtand his Diſtemper, and the Compliance of the Patient to the Rules of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick is reckon'd half the Cure. You appear ſenſible of the Malady, and therefore may reaſonably expect a Remedy, though your Diſeaſe being fix'd by a long Inveteracy, muſt ſubject you (I'm afraid) to a tedious Courſe The almighty Phyſician will apply effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Medicines: Therefore be of good Heart, and do your Part towards the Recovery of your ſick Conſcience. If you have a Mind to take the ſhorteſt Road to Happineſs, immediately abandon the fatal Profeſſion you now follow, and come under my Tui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be inſtructed in the Rules of Knight-Errantry,
<pb n="1209" facs="tcp:54446:648"/>
which will ſoon expiate your Offences, and intitle you to Honour and true Felicity. <hi>Roque</hi> ſmil'd to hear Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s ſerious Advice, and changing the Diſcourſe, gave him an Account of <hi>Claudia Jeroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>'s tragical Adventure, which griev'd <hi>Sancho</hi> to the Heart; for the Beauty, Life and Spirit of the young Damſel had not a little wrought upon his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
                        <p>By this Time <hi>Roque</hi>'s Party had brought in their Prize, conſiſting of two Gentlemen on Horſeback, and two Pilgrims on Foot, and a Coach full of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, attended by ſome half a dozen Servants a-foot and a-Horſeback, beſides two Muleteers that belong'd to the two Gentlemen. They were all conducted in ſolemn Order, ſurrounded by the Victors, both they and the vanquiſh'd ſilent, and expecting the definitive Sentence of the Grand <hi>Roque.</hi> He firſt ask'd the Gentlemen who they were? Whither bound? And what Money they had about 'em? They anſwer'd, that they were both Captains of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Foot, that their Companies were in <hi>Naples;</hi> and they deſign'd to embark on one of the four Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, which they heard were bound for <hi>Sicily,</hi> and their whole Stock amounted to two or three hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Crowns, which they thought a pretty Sum of Money for Men of their Profeſſion, who ſeldom uſe to hoard up Riches. The Pilgrims being examin'd in like manner, ſaid, they intended to embark for <hi>Rome,</hi> and had about ſome threſcore Reals between 'em both. Upon examining the Coach, he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by one of the Servants, that my Lady Donna <hi>Guiomar de Quinonnes,</hi> Wife to a Judge of <hi>Naples,</hi> with her little Daughter, a Chamber-maid, and <hi>Duena,</hi> together with ſix other Servants, had among 'em all about ſix hundred Crowns. So then, ſaid <hi>Roque,</hi> we have got here in all nine hundred Crowns and ſixty Reals; I think I have got about threeſcore Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<pb n="1210" facs="tcp:54446:649"/>
here with me. Now among ſo many Men how much will fall to each particular Share? Let me ſee, for I am none of the beſt Accomptants. Caſt it up, Gentlemen. The Highway-men hearing this, cry'd, long live <hi>Roque Guinart,</hi> and damn the Dogs that ſeek his Ruin. The Officers look'd ſimply, the Lady was ſadly dejected, and the Pilgrims were no leſs caſt down, thinking this a very odd Confiſcation of their little Stock. <hi>Roque</hi> held 'em a while in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to obſerve their Humours, which he found all very plainly to agree in that Point, of being melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick for the Loſs of their Money: Then turning to the Officers, do me the favour, Captains, ſaid he, to lend me threeſcore Ducats; and you, Madam, if your Ladyſhip pleaſes, ſhall oblige me with fourſcore, to gratify theſe honeſt Gentlemen of my Squadron; 'tis our whole Eſtate and Fortune; and you know, the Abbot dines, of what he Sings for. Therefore I hope you will excuſe our Demands, which will free you from any more Diſturbance of this nature, being ſecur'd by a Paſs, which I ſhall give you, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the reſt of my Squadrons that are poſted in theſe Parts, and who, by virtue of my Order, will let you go unmoleſted; for I ſcorn to wrong a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, and I muſt not fail in my Reſpects, Madam, to the fair Sex, eſpecially to Ladies of your Quality.</p>
                        <p>The Captains with all the Grace they could, thank'd him for his great Civility and Liberality, for ſo they eſteem'd his letting them keep their own Mony. The Lady would have thrown her ſelf out of the Coach at his Feet, but <hi>Roque</hi> would not ſuffer it, rather excuſing the Preſumption of his Demands, which he was forc'd to, in pure Compliance with the Neceſſity of his Fortune. The Lady then order'd one of her Servants to pay immediately the fourſcore Crowns. The Officers disburſed their <hi>Quota,</hi> and the Pilgrims made an Oblation of their Mite; but
<pb n="1211" facs="tcp:54446:649"/>
                           <hi>Roque</hi> ordering 'em to wait a little; and turning to his Men, Gentlemen, ſaid he, here are two Crowns a piece for each of you, and twenty over and above. Now let us beſtow ten of 'em on theſe poor Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims, and the other ten on this honeſt Squire, that he may give us a good Word in his Travels. So cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for Pen, Ink and Paper, of which he always went provided, he wrote a Paſsport for 'em, directed to the Commanders of his ſeveral Parties, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Leave, diſmiſs'd 'em, all wondring at his Greatneſs of Soul that ſpoke rather an <hi>Alexander</hi> than a profeſs'd Highway-man. One of his Men began to mutter in his <hi>Catalan</hi> Language: This Captain of ours is plaguy charitable, he would make a better Frier than a Pad; come, come, if he has a Mind to be ſo liberal forſooth, let his own Pocket, not ours pay for it. The Wretch ſpoke not ſo low, but he was over-heard by <hi>Roque,</hi> who whipping out his Sword, with one ſtroke almoſt cleft his Skull in two. Thus it is I puniſh Mutiny, ſaid he. All the reſt ſtood motionleſs, and durſt not mutter one Word, ſo great was the Awe they bore him. <hi>Roque</hi> then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew a little, and wrote a Letter to a Friend of his in <hi>Barcelona,</hi> to let him know, that the famous Knight-Errant Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> of whom ſo many ſtrange Things were reported, was with him; that he might be ſure to find him on <hi>Midſummer-day</hi> on the great Key of that City, arm'd at all Points, mounted on <hi>Roſinante,</hi> and his Squire on an Aſs; that he was the moſt pleaſant ingenious Coxcomb in Nature, and might make excellent Diverſion to him and his Friends the <hi>Niarros,</hi> who he deſir'd might ſhare in the Jeſt, which he thought too good for the <hi>Cadells</hi> his Adverſaries to partake of. He deliver'd the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to one of his Men, who changing his Highway-cloaths to a Country-man's Habit, went to <hi>Barcelona,</hi> and gave it as directed.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. LXI.</hi> Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Entry, into <hi>Barcelona,</hi> with other Accidents that have leſs Wiſdom than Truth in 'em.</head>
                        <p>DON <hi>Quixote</hi> ſtay'd three Days and three Nights with <hi>Roque,</hi> and had he tarried as many hundred Years, he might have found Subject enough for Admiration in that Kind of Life. They ſlept in one Place, and eat in another, ſometimes fearing they knew not what, then laying in wait for they knew not whom. Sometimes forc'd to ſteal a Nap ſtanding, never enjoying a ſound Sleep. Now in this Side the Country, then preſently in another Quarter; always upon the Watch, Spies hearkning, Scouts liſtening, Carabines preſenting; though of ſuch heavy Guns they had but few, being arm'd generally with Piſtols. <hi>Roque</hi> himſelf ſlept a-part from the reſt, making no Man privy to his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; for ſo many were the Proclamations againſt him from the Viceroy of <hi>Barcelona,</hi> and ſuch were his Diſquiets, and Fears of being betray'd by ſome of his Men for the Price of his Head, that he durſt truſt no Body. A Life moſt miſerable and uneaſy.</p>
                        <p>At length, by Croſs-roads, and By-ways, <hi>Roque,</hi> Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and <hi>Sancho,</hi> attended by ſix other Squires, got to the Strand of <hi>Barcelona</hi> on <hi>Midſummer-Eve</hi> at Knight; where <hi>Roque,</hi> having embrac'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and preſented <hi>Sancho</hi> with the ten Crowns he had promis'd him, took his Leave of 'em both, after many Compliments on both Sides. <hi>Roque</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
<pb n="1213" facs="tcp:54446:650"/>
to his Company, and Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ſtay'd there waiting the Approach of Day, mounted as <hi>Roque</hi> left him. Not long after, the fair <hi>Aurora</hi> began to peep thro' the Balconies of the Eaſt, cheering the Flowry Fields, while at the ſame Time a melodious Sound of Hautboys and Kettle-Drums cheer'd the Ears, and preſently was joyn'd with Jangling of Morrice-Bells and the trampling of Horſe, as if coming from the City. Now <hi>Aurora</hi> uſher'd up the Jolly Sun, who look'd big on the Verge of the Horizon, with his broad Face as ample as a Target. Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and <hi>Sancho,</hi> caſting their Looks abroad, diſcover'd the Sea, which they had never ſeen before. To 'em it made a noble and ſpacious Appearance, far bigger than the Lake <hi>Ruydera,</hi> which they ſaw in <hi>La Mancha.</hi> The Gallies in the Port taking in their Awnings, made a pleaſant Sight with their Flags and Strea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, that wav'd in the Air, and ſometimes kiſs'd and ſwept the Water. The Trumpets, Hautboys and other Warlike Inſtruments that reſounded from on board, fill'd the Air all around with a reviving and martial Harmony. A while after, the Gallies moving, began to joyn on the calm Sea in a conter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Engagement; and at the ſame Time a vaſt Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Gentlemen march'd out of the City nobly equipp'd, with rich Liveries, and gallantly moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and in like manner did their Part on the Land, to compleat the warlike Entertainment. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines diſcharg'd numerous Vollies from the Gallies, which were anſwer'd by the great Guns from the Battlements of the Walls and Forts about the City, and the mighty Noiſe eccho'd from the Gallies again by a Diſcharge of the long Pieces of Ordnance in their Fore-caſtles. The Sea ſmil'd and danc'd, the Land was gay, and the Sky ſerene in every Quarter, but where the Clouds of Smoke dimm'd it a while: Freſh Joy ſate ſmiling in the Looks of Men, and
<pb n="1214" facs="tcp:54446:651"/>
Gladneſs and Pomp were diſplay'd in all their Glory. <hi>Sancho</hi> was mightily puzzel'd though, to diſcover how theſe huge bulky Things that mov'd on the Sea ſhou'd have ſo many Feet.</p>
                        <p>By this Time the Gentlemen that maintain'd the Sports on the Shore, gallopping up to Don <hi>Quixote</hi> with loud Acclamations, the Knight was not a little aſtoniſh'd: One of 'em amongſt the reſt, who was the Perſon to whom <hi>Roque</hi> had written, cry'd out aloud; Welcome, the Mirror, the Light, and North-Star of Knight-Errantry! Welcome, I ſay, Valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> not the Counterfeit and Apocryphal, ſhewn us lately in falſe Hiſtories, but the true, legitimate, and identick he, deſcrib'd by <hi>Cid Hamet,</hi> the Flower of Hiſtoroigraphers! Don <hi>Quixote</hi> made no Anſwer, nor did the Gentleman ſtay for any, but wheeling about with the reſt of his Companions, all prancing round him in token of Joy, they encompaſs'd the Knight and the Squire. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> turning about to <hi>Sancho,</hi> it ſeems, ſaid he, theſe Gentlemen know us well. I dare engage they have read our Hiſtory, and that which the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragonian</hi> lately publiſh'd. The Gentleman that ſpoke to the Knight, returning, Noble Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> ſaid he, we entreat you to come along with the Company, being all your humble Servants, and Friends of <hi>Roque Guinart.</hi> Sir, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> your Courteſie bears ſuch a Likeneſs to the great <hi>Roque</hi>'s Generoſity, that could Civility beget Civility, I ſhou'd take yours for the Daughter or near Relation of his. I ſhall wait on you where you pleaſe to command, for I am wholly at your Devotion: The Gentleman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd his Compliment, and ſo all of 'em encloſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> the Devil himſelf, two miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous young Baſtards made a ſhift to get through the Croud of Horſe-men, and one of 'em lifting up <hi>Reſinante</hi>'s Tail, and the other that of <hi>Dapple,</hi> they thruſt a Handful of Briers under each of 'em. The poor Animals feeling ſuch unuſual Spurs apply'd to their Poſteriors, clapp'd their Tails cloſe, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd their Pain, and began to wince, and flounce, and kick ſo furiouſly, that at laſt they threw their Riders, and laid both Maſter and Man ſprawling in the Street. Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> out of Countenance, and nettl'd at his Diſgrace, went to diſ-engage his Horſe from his new Plumage, and <hi>Sancho</hi> did as much for <hi>Dapple,</hi> while the Gentlemen turn'd to chaſtiſe the Boys for their Rudeneſs. But the young Rogues were ſafe enough, being preſently loſt among a huge Rabble that follow'd. The Knight and Squire then mounted again, and the Muſick and Proceſſion went on, till they arriv'd at their Conductor's Houſe, which, by its Largeneſs and Beauty, beſpoke the Owner Maſter of a great Eſtate; where we leave him for the preſent, becauſe 'tis <hi>Cid Hamet</hi>'s Will and Pleaſure it ſhou d be ſo.</p>

                        <p>THE Perſon where Don <hi>Quixote</hi> lodg'd, was call'd Don <hi>Antonio Moreno,</hi> a Gentleman of good Parts, and plentiful Fortune, loving all thoſe Diverſions that may innocently be obtain'd without
<pb n="1216" facs="tcp:54446:652"/>
Prejudice to his Neighbours and not of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of thoſe, who wou'd rather loſe their Friend than their Jeſt. He therefore reſolv'd to make his Advantage of Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Follies without Detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his Perſon.</p>
                        <p>In order to this, he perſwaded the Knight to take off his Armour, and in his ſtraight-lac'd Chamois-Cloaths (as we have already ſhewn him) to ſtand in a Balcony that look'd into one of the principal Streets of the City, where he ſtood expos'd to the Rabble that were got together; eſpecially the Boys, who gap'd and ſtar'd on him, as if he had been ſome overgrown Baboon. The ſeveral Brigades of Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers in their Liveries, began afreſh to fetch their Careers about him, as if the Ceremony were rather perform'd in Honour of Don <hi>Quixote</hi> than any So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of the Feſtival. <hi>Sancho</hi> was hugely pleas'd, fancying he had chopp'd upon another <hi>Camachio</hi>'s Wedding, or another Houſe like that of <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

                        <p>Several of Don <hi>Antonio</hi>'s Friends din'd with him that Day, and all of 'em honouring and reſpecting Don <hi>Quixote</hi> as a Knight-Errant, they puff'd up his Vanity to ſuch a Degree, that he cou'd ſcarce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the Pleaſure he took in their Adulation. As for <hi>Sancho,</hi> he made ſuch Sport to the Servants of the Houſe, and all that heard him, that they watch'd every Word that came from his Mouth. Being all very merry at Table, Honeſt <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio,</hi> I am told, you admire Capons and Sauſages ſo much, that you can't be ſatisfied with a Belly-full, and when you can eat no more, you cram the reſt into your Breeches againſt the next Morning. No, Sir, an't like you, anſwer'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> 'tis all a Story, I am more cleanly than greedy, I'd have you to know; herels my Maſter can tell you, that many Times he
<pb n="1217" facs="tcp:54446:652"/>
and I uſe to live for a Week together upon a handful of Acorns and Walnuts. Truth is, I am not over nice; in ſuch a Place as this I eat what's given me; for a Gift-Horſe ſhou'd not be look'd in the Mouth. But whoſoever told you I was a Greedy-Gut and a Sloven, has told you a Fib, and were it not for Reſpect to the Company, I would tell him more of my Mind, ſo I wou'd: Verily, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> the Manner of <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Feeding ought to be deliver'd to ſucceeding Ages on brazen Monuments, as a future Memorial of his Abſtinence and Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and an Example to Poſterity. 'Tis true, when he ſatisfies the Call of Hunger, he ſeems to do it ſomewhat ravenouſly; indeed he ſwallows apace, uſes his Grinders very notably, and chews with both Jaws at once. But in ſpight of the Charge of Slo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venlineſs now laid upon him, I muſt declare he is ſo nice an Obſerver of Neatneſs, that he ever makes a clear Conveyance of his Food; when he was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, his Nicety in Eating was remarkable, for he us'd to pick even Grapes and Pomegranate-Seeds with the Point of his Fork. How, cry'd Don <hi>Antonio,</hi> has <hi>Sancho</hi> then been a Governour? Ay, marry has he, anſwer'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> Governour of the Iſland of <hi>Barataria.</hi> Ten Day's I govern'd, and who but I! But I was ſo broken of my Reſt all the Time, that all I got by't was to learn to hate the Trade of Governing from the Bottom of my Soul So that I made ſuch Haſte to leave it, I fell into a deep Hole, where I was buried alive, and ſhou'd have lain till now, had not Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence pull'd me out of it. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> then related the Circumſtances of <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Government; and the Cloath being taken away, Don <hi>Antonio</hi> took the Knight by the Hand, and carry'd him into a private Chamber, wherein there was no Kind of Furniture but a Table that appear'd to be of Jaſper, ſupported
<pb n="1218" facs="tcp:54446:653"/>
by Feet of the ſame, with a brazen Head ſet upon it, from the Breaſt upwards like the Effigies of one of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors. Don <hi>Antonio</hi> having walk'd with Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ſeveral Turns about the Room, Senior Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> ſaid he, being aſſur'd that we are very private, the Door faſt, and no Body liſtning, I ſhall commuicate to you one of the moſt ſtrange and wonderful Adventures that ever were known, provided you treaſure it up as a Secret in the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt Apartment of your Breaſt. I ſhall be as ſecret as the Grave, anſwer'd the Knight, and will clap a Tomb-ſtone over your Secret for further Security; beſides, aſſure your ſelf Don <hi>Antonio,</hi> continu'd he, (for by this Time he had learn'd the Gentleman's Name) you converſe with a Perſon, whoſe Ears are open to receive what his Tongue never betrays. So that whatever you commit to my Truſt, ſhall be buried in the Depth of bottomleſs Silence, and lye as ſecure as in your own Breaſt.</p>

                        <p>That Afternoon they carry'd Don <hi>Quixote</hi> abroad, without his Armour, mounted, not on <hi>Roſinante,</hi> but on a large eaſie going Mule, with genteel Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, and himſelf dreſs'd after the City-Faſhion, with a long Coat of Tawny-colour'd Cloath, which with the preſent Heat of the Seaſon, was enough to put Froſt it ſelf into a Sweat. They gave private Orders that <hi>Sancho</hi> ſhould be entertain'd within doors all that Day; leſt he ſhould ſpoil their Sport by going out. The Knight being mounted, they pinn'd to his Back without his Knowledge a Piece of Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with theſe Words written in large Letters; This is Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha.</hi> As ſoon as they began their Walk, the Sight of the Parchment drew the Eyes of every Body to read the Inſcription; ſo
<pb n="1220" facs="tcp:54446:655"/>
that the Knight hearing ſo many People repeat the Words, This is Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> wonder'd to hear himſelf nam'd and known by every one that ſaw him: Thereupon turning to Don <hi>Antonio</hi> that rode by his Side, How great, ſaid he, is this ſingle Prerogative of Knight-Errantry, by which its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors are known and diſtinguiſh'd, through all the Confines of the Univerſe. Don't you hear, Sir, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd he, how the very Boys in the Street, who have never ſeen me before, know me? 'Tis very true, Sir, anſwer'd Don <hi>Antonio,</hi> like Fire that always diſcovers it ſelf by its own Light, ſo Vertue has that Luſtre that never fails to diſplay it ſelf, eſpecially that Renown which is acquir'd by the Profeſſion of Arms.</p>
                        <p>During this Proceſſion of the Knight, and his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauding Followers, a certain <hi>Caſtilian</hi> reading the Scroll at Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Back, cry'd out aloud, Now the Devil take thee for Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha!</hi> who would have thought to have found thee here, and ſtill alive, after ſo many hearty Drubbings that have been laid about thy Shoulders. Can't you be mad in private, and among your Friends, with a Pox to you, but you muſt run about the World at this Rate, and make every Body that keeps you Company as Errant-Coxcombs as your ſelf? Get you home to your Wife and Children, Blockhead, look after your Houſe, and leave playing the Fool and diſtracting thy Senſes at this Rate with a Parcel of nonſenſical Whimſeys. Friend, ſaid Don <hi>Antonio,</hi> go about your Buſineſs, and keep your Advice for them that want it. Senior Don <hi>Quixote</hi> is a Man of too much Senſe not to be above your Counſel, and we that bear him Company know our Buſineſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your intermeddling. We only pay the Reſpect due to Vertue. So, in the Name of ill-luck, go
<pb n="1221" facs="tcp:54446:655"/>
your Ways, and don't meddle where you have no Buſineſs. Truly now, ſaid the <hi>Caſtilian,</hi> you're in the Right, for 'tis but ſtriving againſt the Stream to give him Advice, though it grieves me to think that this Whim of Knight-Errantry ſhould ſpoil all the good Parts which they ſay this Mad-man has. But Ill-luck light on me, as you'd have it, and all my Generation, if e'er you catch me adviſing him or any one elſe again, though I were deſir'd, and were to live to the Years of <hi>Methuſalem.</hi> So ſaying, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſer went his Ways, and the Cavalcade continu'd; but the Rabble preſs'd ſo very thick to read the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, that Don <hi>Antonio</hi> was forc'd to pull it off, under Pretence of doing ſomething elſe.</p>
                        <p>Upon the Approach of Night they return'd home, where Don <hi>Antonio</hi>'s Wife, a Lady of Quality, and every way accompliſh'd, had invited ſeveral of her Friends to a Ball, to honour her Gueſt, and ſhare in the Diverſion his Extravagances afforded. After a noble Supper the Dancing began about ten a Clock at Night. Among others, were two Ladies of an airy, waggiſh Diſpoſition, ſuch, as though vertuous enough at the bottom, would not ſtick to ſtrain a Part of Modeſty for the Diverſion of good Company. Theſe two made their Court chiefly to Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and ply'd him ſo with Dancing one after another, that they tir'd not only his Body but his very Soul. But the beſt was to ſee what an unaccountable Figure the grave Don made, as he hopp'd and ſtalk'd about, a long ſway-back'd, ſtarv'd-look'd, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flank'd, two-legg'd Thing, Wainſcot-Complexion'd, ſtuck up in's cloſe Doublet, aukward enough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcience, and certainly none of the lighteſt at a Saraband. The Ladies gave him ſeveral private Hints of their Inclination to his Perſon, and he was not behind hand in intimating to them as ſecretly, that
<pb n="1222" facs="tcp:54446:656"/>
they were very indifferent to him, till at laſt being almoſt teiz'd to Death, <hi>Fugite partes adverſae,</hi> cry'd he aloud, and avaunt Temptation. Pray Ladies, play your amorous Pranks with ſome Body elſe, and leave me to the Enjoyment of my own Thoughts, which are all employ'd and taken up with the peer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo,</hi> the ſole Queen of my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and ſo ſaying, he ſat himſelf down in the Middle of the Room to reſt his wearied Bones. Don <hi>Antonio</hi> gave Order that he ſhould be taken up and carry'd to Bed; and the firſt who was ready to lend a helping Hand was <hi>Sancho,</hi> and as he was lifting him up, By'r Lady, Sir, Maſter of mine, you have ſhook your heels moſt fetiouſly. Do you think we who are ſtout and valiant muſt be Caperers, and that every Knight-Errant muſt be a Snapper of Caſtinets? If you do, you're woundily deceiv'd, let me tell you. Gadzookers, ſome would rather undertake the killing of a Giant, than the Cutting of a Caper. Had you been for an Antick, I'd have done your Buſineſs for you, for I can jigg it and hop it about like any Hawk; but as for your fine Dancing, the Devil take him that knows any thing of it for me. This made Diverſion for the Company, till <hi>Sancho</hi> led out his Maſter, in order to put him to Bed, where he left him cover'd over Head and Ears that he might ſweat out the Cold he had caught by Dancing.</p>
                        <p>The next Day Don <hi>Antonio</hi> reſolving to make his intended Experiment on the inchanted Head, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted Don <hi>Quixote</hi> into the Room where it ſtood, together with <hi>Sancho,</hi> a Couple of his Friends, and the two Ladies that had ſo teaz'd the Knight at the Ball, and who had ſtaid all night with his Wife, and having carefully lock'd the Door, and enjoyn'd them Secrecy, he told them the Virtue of the Head, and that this was the firſt Time he ever made Proof of it; and except his two Friends, no Body did
<pb n="1223" facs="tcp:54446:656"/>
know the Trick of the Inchantment, and, had not they been told of it before, they had been drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame Errour with the reſt; for the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the Machine was ſo artful and ſo cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manag'd, that it was impoſſible to diſcover the Cheat. Don <hi>Antonio</hi> himſelf was the firſt that made his Application to the Ear of the Head, cloſe to which ſpeaking in a Voice juſt loud enough to be heard by the Company; tell me, O Head, ſaid he, by that myſterious Virtue wherewith thou are endu'd, what are my Thoughts at preſent? The Head in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct and intelligible Voice, though without moving the Lips, anſwer'd, <hi>I am no Judge of Thoughts.</hi> They were all aſtoniſh'd at the Voice, being ſenſible no Body was in the Room to anſwer. How many of us are there in the Room ſaid Don <hi>Antonio</hi> again? The Voice anſwered in the ſame Key, Thou and thy Wife, two of thy Friends, and two of hers, a famous Knight call'd Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> and his Squire <hi>Sancho Pança</hi> by Name. Now their Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was greater than before, now they wonder'd indeed, and the Hair of ſome of 'em ſtood an end with Amazement. 'Tis enough, ſaid <hi>Antonio,</hi> ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping aſide from the Head, I am convinc'd, 'twas no Impoſtor ſold thee to me, Sage Head, diſcourſing Head, Oraculous, Miraculous Head! Now let ſome Body elſe try their Fortunes. As Women are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally moſt curious and inquiſitive, one of the Dancing Ladies venturing up to it, tell me, Head, ſaid ſhe, what ſhall I do to be truly beautiful. <hi>Be honeſt,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd the Head. I have done, reply'd the Lady. Her Companion then came on, and with the ſame Curioſity, I would know, ſaid ſhe, whether my Husband loves me or no? The Head anſwer'd, <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his Uſage, and that will tell thee.</hi> Truly (ſaid the marry'd Lady to her ſelf as ſhe withdrew) that Queſtion was needleſs; for indeed a Man's Actions
<pb n="1224" facs="tcp:54446:657"/>
are the ſureſt Tokens of the Diſpoſition of his Mind. Next came on one of Don <hi>Antonio</hi>'s Friends, and ask'd, who am I? The Anſwer was, <hi>Thou knoweſt;</hi> That's from the Queſtion, reply'd the Gentleman; I would have thee tell me whether thou know'ſt me: <hi>I do,</hi> anſwer'd the Head, <hi>thou art Don</hi> Pedro Noris, Tis enough, O Head, ſaid the Gentleman, thou haſt convinc'd me, that thou know'ſt all Things. So making Room for ſome Body elſe, his Friend ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd, and ask'd the Head what his eldeſt Son and Heir deſir'd, I have already told thee, ſaid the Head, that I was no Judge of Thoughts; however, I will tell thee, that what thy Heir deſires, is to bury thee. 'Tis ſo, reply'd the Gentleman, What, I ſee with my Eye, I mark with my Finger, I know enough.</p>
                        <p>Don <hi>Antonio</hi>'s Lady ask'd the next Quſtion, I don't well know what to ask thee, ſaid ſhe to the Head, only tell me whether I ſhall long enjoy my dear Husband. Thou ſhalt, anſwer'd the Head, for his healthy Conſtitution and Temperance promiſe Length of Days, while thoſe who live too faſt, are not like to live long. Next came Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> tell me thou Oracle ſaid he, was what I reported of my Adventures in <hi>Monteſinos</hi>'s Cave, a Dream or Reality? Will <hi>Sancho</hi> my Squire fulfil his Promiſe, and ſcourge himſelf effectually? And ſhall <hi>Dulcinea</hi> be diſ-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted? As for the Adventures in the Cave, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd the Head; there's much to be ſaid; they have ſomething of both; <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Whipping ſhall go on but leiſurely; however, <hi>Dulcinea</hi> ſhall at laſt be really freed from Inchantment That's all I deſire to know, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> for the whole Streſs of my good Fortune depends on <hi>Dulcinea</hi>'s Diſinchantment. Then <hi>Sancho</hi> made the laſt Application; An't pleaſe you Mr. Head, quoth he, ſhall I chance to have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Government? ſhall I ever get clear of this ſtarving Squire-Erranting? And ſhall I ever ſee my
<pb n="1225" facs="tcp:54446:657"/>
own Fire-ſide again? The Head anſwer'd, thou ſhalt be a Governour in thine own Houſe; if thou go'ſt home, thou may'ſt ſee thy own Fire-ſide again; and if thou leav'ſt off thy Service, thou ſhalt get clear of thy Squireſhip. Gadzookers, cry'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> that's a very good one, trow! a Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head might h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>' told all this; I could have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy'd thus much my ſelf. How now, Brute, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> what Anſwers would'ſt thou have but what are pertinent to thy Queſtions? Nay, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſince you'll have it ſo, it ſhall be ſo; I only wiſh Mr. Head would have told me a little more concerning the Matter.</p>
                        <p>Thus the Queſtions propos'd, and the Anſwers return'd were brought to a Period, but the Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment contiu'd among all the Company, except Don <hi>Antonio</hi>'s two. Friends who underſtood the Myſtery, which <hi>Benengeli</hi> is reſolv'd now to diſcover, that the World ſhould be no longer amus'd with an Erroneous Opinion of any Magick or Witchcraft operating in the Head. He therefore tells you, that Don <hi>Antonio Moreno,</hi> to divert himſelf, and ſurprize the Ignorant, had this made in Imitation of ſuch another Device, which he had ſeen contriv'd by a Statuary at <hi>Madrid.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Manner of it was thus. The Table and the Frame on which it ſtood, the Feet of which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembl'd four Eagles Claws, were of Wood, painted and varniſh'd like Jaſper. The Head, which look'd like the <hi>Buſt</hi> of a <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor, and of a Braſs Colour, was all hollow and ſo were the Feet of the Table, which anſwer'd exactly to the Neck and Breaſt of the Head, the whole ſo artificially fix'd, that it ſeem'd to be all of a Piece, through this Cavity ran a Tin-Pipe, convey'd into it by a Paſſage through the Cieling of the Room under the Table. He that was to anſwer ſet his Mouth to the End of
<pb n="1226" facs="tcp:54446:658"/>
the Pipe in the Chamber underneath, and by the Hollowneſs of the Trunk receiv'd their Queſtions, and deliver'd his Anſwers in clear and articulate Words, ſo that the Impoſture could ſcarcely be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd. The Oracle was manag'd by a young in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Gentleman, Don <hi>Antonio</hi>'s Nephew. who having his Inſtructions before-hand from his Uncle, was able to anſwer readily and directly to the firſt Queſtions, and by Conjectures or Evaſions, make a Return handſomely to the reſt, with the Help of his Ingenuity. <hi>Cid Hamet</hi> informs us further, that, during ten or twelve Days after this, the wonderful Machine continu'd in mighty Repute, but at laſt the Noiſe of Don <hi>Antonio</hi>'s having an inchanted Head in his Houſe that gave Anſwers to all Queſtions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſly about the City; and as he fear'd this would reach the Ears of the watchful Centinels of our Faith, he thought ſit to give an Account of the whole Matter to the Reverend Inquiſitors, who or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd him to break it to Pieces, leſt it ſhould give Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of Scandal among the ignorant Vulgar. But ſtill the Head paſs'd for an Oracle and a Piece of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment with Don <hi>Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho,</hi> though the Truth is, the Knight was much better ſatisfied in the Matter than the Squire.</p>
                        <p>The Gentlemen of the Town in Complaiſance to Don <hi>Antonio,</hi> and for Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s more ſplendid Entertainment, or rather to make his Madneſs more publick Diverſion, appointed a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Don <hi>Quixote</hi> had a Mind to take a Turn in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on Foot, that he might avoid the Croud of Boys that follow'd him when he rode. He went out with <hi>Sancho</hi> and two of Don <hi>Antonio</hi>'s Servants, that attended by their Maſter's Order; and paſſing thro' a certain Street, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> look'd up, and ſpy'd
<pb n="1227" facs="tcp:54446:658"/>
written over a Door in great Letters theſe Words. <hi>Here is a Printing-Houſe.</hi> This Diſcovery pleas'd the Knight extremely, having now an Opportunity of ſeeing a Printing-Preſs, a Thing he had never ſeen before; and therefore to ſatisfy his Curioſity, in he went with all his Train. There he ſaw ſome work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the Sheets, others correcting the Forms, ſome in one Place picking of Letters out of the Caſes, in another ſome looking over a Proof; in ſhort, all the Variety that is to be ſeen in great Printing-Houſes. He went from one Work-man to another, and was very inquiſitive to know what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Body had in Hand; and they were not back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to ſatisfy his Curioſity. At length coming to one of the Compoſitors, and asking him what he was about; Sir, ſaid the Printer, this Gentleman here, (ſhewing a likely ſort of a Man, ſomething grave, and not young) has tranſlated a Book out of <hi>Italian</hi> into <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and I am ſetting ſome of it here for the Preſs. What is the Name of it pray? ſaid Don <hi>Quixote.</hi> Sir, anſwer'd the Author, the Title of it in <hi>Italian</hi> is <hi>Le Bagatele.</hi> And pray Sir, ask'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> what's the Meaning of that Word in <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh?</hi> Sir, anſwer'd the Gentleman, <hi>Le Bagatele</hi> is as much as to ſay <hi>Triſles;</hi> but though the Title promiſes ſo little, yet the Contents are Matters of Importance. I am a little converſant in the <hi>Italian,</hi> ſaid the Knight, and value my ſelf upon ſinging ſome Stanza's of <hi>Arioſto;</hi> therefore, Sir (without any Offence, and not doubting of your Skill, but meerly to ſatisfy my Curioſity) pray tell me, have you ever met with ſuch a Word as <hi>Pinnata</hi> in <hi>Italian?</hi> Yes very often, Sir, anſwer'd the Author. And how do you render it pray? ſaid Don <hi>Quixote.</hi> How ſhould I render it, Sir, reply'd the Tranſlator, but by the Word Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge-Pot? Body of me, cry'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> you are Maſter of the <hi>Italian</hi> Idiom? I dare hold a good Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="1228" facs="tcp:54446:659"/>
that where the <hi>Italian</hi> ſays <hi>Piaccie,</hi> you tranſlate it <hi>pleaſe;</hi> where it ſays <hi>piu,</hi> you render it <hi>more; ſu, above,</hi> and <hi>giu, beneath.</hi> Moſt certainly Sir, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd t'other, for ſuch are their proper Significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. What rare Parts, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> are loſt to Mankind for Want of their being exerted and known! I dare ſwear, Sir, that the World is backward in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging your Merit. But 'tis the Fate of all inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Men: How many of 'em are crampt up and diſcountenanc'd by a narrow Fortune! And how many, in Spight of the moſt laborious Induſtry, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd! Though by the Way, Sir, I think this kind of Verſion, from one Language to another, (except it be from the nobleſt of Tongues, the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi>) is like viewing a Piece of <hi>Flemmiſh</hi> Tapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry on the wrong Side, where, though the Figures are diſtinguiſhable, yet there are ſo many Ends and Threads, that the Beauty and Exactneſs of the Work is obſcur'd, and not ſo advantagiouſly diſcern'd as on the right Side of the Hangings. Neither can this barren Employment of tranſlating out of eaſy Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages ſhew either Wit or Maſtery of Style, no more than copying a Piece of Writing by a Precedent; though ſtill the Buſineſs of Tranſlating wants not its Commendations, ſince Men very often may be worſe employ'd As a further Proof of its Merits, we have Doctor <hi>Chriſtoval de Figueroa</hi>'s Tranſlation of <hi>Paſtor Fido,</hi> and Don <hi>Juan de Xaurigui</hi>'s <hi>Aminta,</hi> Pieces ſo excellently well done, that they have made 'em purely their own and left the Reader in Doubt which is Tranſlation and which Original. But tell me, pray Sir, do you print your Book at your own Charge, or have you ſold the Copy to a Book-ſeller? Why truly Sir, anſwer'd the Tranſlator, I publiſh it upon my own Account, and I hope to clear at leaſt a thouſand Crowns by this firſt Edition; for I deſign to print off two thouſand Books, and they will go
<pb n="1229" facs="tcp:54446:659"/>
off at ſix Reals apiece in a Trice. I'm afraid you'll come ſhort of your Reckoning, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> 'tis a Sign you are ſtill a Stranger to the Tricks of theſe Bookſellers and Printers, and the Juggling there is among them. I dare engage you will find two thouſand Books lie very heavy upon your Hands, eſpecially if the Piece be ſomewhat tedious, and wants Spirit. What, Sir, reply'd the Author, would you have me ſell the Profit of my Labour to a Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller for three Maravedis a Sheet? for that's the moſt they will bid, nay and expect too I ſhould thank 'em for the Offer. No, no, Sir, I print not my Works to get Fame in the World, my Name is up already; Profit, Sir, is my End, and without it what ſignifies Reputation? Well, Sir, go on and proſper, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> and with that moving to another Part of the Room, he ſaw a Man correcting a Sheet of a Book call'd, <hi>The Light of the Soul.</hi> Ay, now this is ſomething, cry'd the Knight, theſe are the Books that ought to be printed, though there are a great many of that Kind; for the Number of Sinners is prodigious in this Age, and there is Need of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Quantity of Lights for ſo many dark Souls as we have among us Then paſſing on, and enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Title of a Book of which another Workman was correcting a Sheet, they told him 'twas the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Part of that ingenious Gentleman Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> written by a certain Perſon, a Native of <hi>Tordeſillas.</hi> I have heard of that Book before, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and really thought it had been burnt, and reduc'd to Aſhes for a fooliſh impertinent Libel; but all in good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </head>
                        <p>MAny and ſerious were Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the Anſwer of the inchanted Head, tho' none hit on the Deceit, but center'd all in the Promiſe of <hi>Dulcinea</hi>'s Diſinchantment; and expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it wou'd ſpeedily be effected, he reſted joyfully ſatisfy'd. As for <hi>Sancho,</hi> tho' he hated the Trouble of being a Governour, yet ſtill he had an itching Ambition to rule, to be obey'd, and appear great; for even Fools love Authority.</p>
                        <p>In ſhort, that Afternoon Don <hi>Antonio,</hi> his two Friends, Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſet out for the Gallies. The Commander being advertis'd of their coming, upon their Appearance on the Key, order'd all the Gallies to ſtrike Sail; the Muſick play'd, and a Pinnace ſpread with rich Carpets and Crimſon-Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet
<pb n="1231" facs="tcp:54446:660"/>
Cuſhions was preſently hoiſted out, and ſent to fetch 'em aboard. As ſoon as Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ſet his Foot into it, the Admiral-Galley diſcharg'd her Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle-Piece, and the reſt of the Gallies did the like. When Don <hi>Quixote</hi> got over the Gunnel of the Galley on the Starboard-ſide, the whole Crew of Slaves, according to their Cuſtom of ſaluting Perſons of Quality, welcom'd him with three <hi>hu, hu, huz,</hi> or <hi>huzzahs.</hi> The General (for ſo we muſt call him) by Birth a <hi>Valencian,</hi> and a Man of Quality, gave him his Hand, and embrac'd him. This Day, ſaid he, will I mark as one of the happieſt I expect to ſee in all my Life, ſince I have the Honour now to ſee Senior Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha;</hi> this Day, I ſay, that ſets before my Eyes the Summary of wandring Chivalry collected in one Perſon. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd his Compliment with no leſs Civility, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd over-joy'd to ſee himſelf ſo treated like a Grandee. Preſently they all went aft on the Deck, which was handſomely adorn'd, and there they took their Places. The Boatſwain went to the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle, and with his Whiſtle or Call gave the Sign to the Slaves to ſtrip, which was obey'd in a Moment. <hi>Sancho</hi> was ſcar'd to ſee ſo many Fellows in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Skins, but moſt of all when he ſaw 'em hoiſt up the Sails ſo incredibly faſt, as he thought cou'd never have been done but by ſo many Devils. He had plac'd himſelf a Mid-ſhips, next the hindmoſt Rower on the Starboard-ſide; who being inſtructed what to do, caught Hold of him, and giving him a Hoiſt, handed him to the next Man, who toſs'd him to a third; and ſo the whole Crew of Slaves, beginning on the Starboard-ſide, made him fly ſo faſt from Bench to Bench, that poor <hi>Sancho</hi> loſt the very Sight of his Eyes, and verily believ'd all the Devils in Hell were carrying him away to rights. Nor did the Slaves give over bandying him about, till they had handed
<pb n="1232" facs="tcp:54446:661"/>
him in the ſame Manner over all the Larboard-ſide; and then they ſet him down where they had taken him up, but ſtrangely diſorder'd, out of Breath, in a cold Sweat, and not truly ſenſible what it was that had happen'd to him.</p>
                        <p>Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ſeeing his Squire fly at this Rate without Wings, ask'd the General if that were a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony us'd to all Strangers aboard the Gallies; for, if it were, he muſt let him know, that as he did not deſign to take up his Reſidence there, he did not like ſuch Entertainment; and vow'd to Heaven, that if any of 'em came to lay Hold on him to toſs him at that Rate, he wou'd ſpurn their Souls out of their Bodies; and with this ſtarting up, he lay'd his Hand on his Sword.</p>
                        <p>At the ſame Time they lower'd their Sails, and with a dreadful Noiſe let down the Main-yard; which ſo frighted <hi>Sancho,</hi> who thought the Sky was off the Hinges, and falling upon him, that he duck'd and thruſt his Head between his Legs for Fear. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was a little Sea-ſick too, he began to ſhiver, and ſhrug up his Shoulders, and chang'd Colour. The Slaves hoiſted the Main-yard again with the ſame Force and Noiſe that they had lower'd it withal. But all this with ſuch Silence on their Parts, as if they had neither Voice nor Breath. The Boatſwain then gave the Word to weigh Anchor; and leaping a top of the Fore-caſtle among the Crew, with his Whip or Bull's-Pizzle, he began to duſt and fly-flap their Shoulders, and by little and little to put off to Sea.</p>
                        <p>When <hi>Sancho</hi> ſaw ſo many colour'd Feet moving at once, for he took the Oars to be ſuch; be ſhrew my Heart, quoth he, here is Inchantment in good Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt; all our Adventures and Witchcrafts have been nothing to this. What h ve theſe poor Wretches done, that their Hides muſt be curry'd at this Rate? And how dares this plaguy Fellow go whiſtling about
<pb n="1233" facs="tcp:54446:661"/>
here by himſelf, and mawl thus ſo many People? Well, I ſay, this is Hell, or Purgatory at leaſt.</p>
                        <p>Don <hi>Quixote</hi> obſerving how earneſtly <hi>Sancho</hi> look'd on theſe Paſſages; ah! dear <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid he, what an eaſy Matter now were it for you to ſtrip to the Waſte, and clap your ſelf among theſe Gentlemen, and ſo compleat <hi>Dulcinea</hi>'s Diſinchantment; among ſo many Companions in Affliction, you wou'd not be ſo ſenſible of the Smart; and beſides, the ſage <hi>Merlin</hi> perhaps might take every one of theſe Laſhes, being ſo well laid on, for ten of thoſe which you muſt certainly one Day inflict on your ſelf. The General of the Gallies was going to ask what he meant by theſe Laſhes, and <hi>Dulcinea</hi>'s Diſinchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; when a Mariner cry'd out, they make Signs to us from <hi>Monjuy,</hi> that there's a Veſſel ſtanding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Shoar to the Weſtward. With that the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral leaping upon the Courſey, cry'd, pull away my Hearts, let her not 'ſcape us; this Brigantine is an <hi>Argiereen,</hi> I warrant her. Preſently the three other Gallies came up with the Admiral to receive Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and he commanded two of 'em to ſtand out to Sea, while he with the other wou'd keep along the Shoar, that ſo they might be ſure of their Prize.</p>
                        <p>The Row<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>rs tugg'd ſo hard, that the Gallies ſcud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded away like Lightning, and thoſe that ſtood to Sea, diſcover'd about two Miles off, a Veſſel with fourteen or fifteen Oars, which, upon Sight of the Gallies, put her ſelf in Chace, hoping by her Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to eſcape; but all in vain, for the Admiral's Galley being one of the ſwifteſt Veſſels in thoſe Seas, gain'd ſo much Way upon her, that the Maſter of the Brigantine ſeeing his Danger, was willing the Crew ſhould quit their Oars and yield, for Fear of exaſperating the General. But Fate order'd it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; for upon the Admiral's coming up with the Brigantine ſo near as to hale her, and bid them ſtrike,
<pb n="1234" facs="tcp:54446:662"/>
two <hi>Toraquis,</hi> that is, two drunken <hi>Turks,</hi> among twelve others that were on board the Veſſel, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd a Couple of Muskets, and kill'd two Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that were upon the Wale of the Galley. The General ſeeing this, vow'd he wou'd not leave a Man of 'em alive; and coming up with great Fury to grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with her, ſhe ſlipp'd away under the Oars of the Galley. The Galley ran a-head a good Way, and the little Veſſel finding her ſelf clear for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, tho' without Hopes to get off, crouded all the Sail ſhe cou'd, and with Oars and Sails began to make the beſt of her Way, while the Galley tack'd round. But all their Diligence did not do 'em ſo much Good as their Preſumption did 'em Harm; for the Admiral coming up with her after a ſhort Chace, clapp'd his Oars in the Veſſel, and ſo took her and every Man in her alive.</p>
                        <p>By this Time the other Gallies were come up, and all four return'd with their Prize into the Harbour, where great Numbers of People ſtood waiting, to know what Prize they had taken. The General came to an Anchor near the Land, and perceiving the Viceroy was on the Shore, he mann'd his Pinnace to fetch him aboard, and gave Orders to ſling up the Main-yard, to hang up the Maſter of the Brigantine, with the reſt of the Crew, which conſiſted of about ſix and thirty Perſons, all proper luſty Fellows, and moſt of 'em <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Musketeers. The General ask'd who commanded the Veſſel; whereupon one of the Priſoners, who was afterwards known to be a <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi> and a Renegado, anſwer'd him in <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> This was our Maſter, my Lord, ſaid he, ſhewing him a young Man not twenty Years of Age, and one of the handſomeſt Perſons that cou'd be imagin'd. You inconſiderate Dog, ſaid the General, what made you kill my Men, when you ſaw 'twas not poſſible for you to eſcape? Is this the Reſpect due to an Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral?
<pb n="1235" facs="tcp:54446:662"/>
Don't you know that Raſhneſs is no Courage? While there is any Hope, we are allowd to be bold, but not to be deſperate. The Maſter was offering to reply, but the General cou'd not ſtay to hear his Anſwer, being oblig'd to go entertain the Viceroy, who was juſt come aboard with his Retinue, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Town. You have had a lucky Chace, my Lord, ſaid the Viceroy. What have you got. Your Excellency ſhall ſee preſently, anſwer'd the General, I'll ſhew 'em to you immediately hanging at the Main-yard-arm. How ſo, reply'd the Viceroy? Becauſe, ſaid he, they have kill'd me, contrary to all Law of Arms, Reaſon, and Cuſtom of the Sea, two of the beſt Soldiers I had on board; for which I have ſworn to hang them every Mother's Son, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially this young Rogue, the Maſter. Saying thus, he ſhew'd him a Perſon with his Hands al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready bound, and the Halter about his Neck, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting nothing but Death. His Youth, Beauty, and Reſignation began to plead much in his behalf with the Viceroy, and making him inclinable to ſave him, Tell me, Captain, ſaid he, Art thou born a <hi>Turk,</hi> or a <hi>Moor,</hi> or art thou a Renegado? None of all theſe, anſwer'd the Youth in as good <hi>Spaniſh.</hi> What then, ſaid the Viceroy? A Chriſtian Woman, reply'd the Youth. A Woman, and a Chriſtian, though in theſe Cloaths, and in ſuch a Poſt; but 'tis a Thing rather to be wonder'd at, than believ'd. I humbly beſeech ye, my Lords, continued the Youth, to defer my Execution till I give you the Hiſtory of my Life, for the Delay of your Revenge will be but ſhort. This Requeſt was urg'd ſo piteouſly, that no Body cou'd deny it; whereupon the General bade him proceed, aſſuring him, nevertheleſs, that there was no Hopes of Pardon for an Offence ſo great as was that of which he was guilty. Then the Youth began.</p>

My Mother was a Chriſtian, my Father, a Man of Diſcretion, profeſſed the ſame Belief, and I ſuck'd the Catholick Faith with my Milk. I was handſomly educated, and never betray'd the leaſt Mark of the <hi>Moriſco.</hi> Breed, either in Language or Behaviour. With theſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, as I grew up, that little Beauty I had, ſuch as it was, began to bloom, and for all my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd Life, and the Reſtraint upon my appearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, a young Gentleman, call'd Don <hi>Gaſpar Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorio</hi> got a View of me. He was Son and Heir to a Knight that liv'd in the next Town: 'twere tedious to relate, how he got an Opportunity to converſe with me, fell deſperately in Love, and affected me with a Senſe of his Paſſion. I muſt be ſhort, leaſt this Halter cut me off in the Middle of my Story. I ſhall only tell you, that he would needs bear me Company in my Baniſhment, and accordingly, by the Help of the <hi>Moriſco</hi> Language, of which he was a perfect Maſter, he mingl'd with the Exiles, and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting acquainted with my two Uncles that conducted me, we all went together to <hi>Barbary,</hi> and took up our Reſidence at <hi>Argiers,</hi> or rather Hell it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>My Father, in the mean time, had very Prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, upon the firſt News of the Proclamation to baniſh us, withdrawn to ſeek a Place of Refuge for us in ſome Foreign Country, leaving a conſiderable Stock
<pb n="1237" facs="tcp:54446:663"/>
of Money and Jewels hidden in a private Place, which he diſcover'd to no Body but me, with Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not to move it till his Return.</p>
                        <p>The King of <hi>Argiers,</hi> underſtanding I had ſome Beauty, and alſo that I was Rich, (which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards turn'd to my Advantage) ſent for me, and was very inquiſitive about my Country, and what Jewels and Gold I had got. I ſatisfied him as to the Place of my Nativity, and gave him to underſtand, that my Riches were buried in a certain Place where I might eaſily recover 'em, were I permitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn where they lay.</p>
                        <p>This I told him, that, in Hopes of ſharing in my Fortune, his Covetouſneſs ſhould divert him from Injuring my Perſon. In the midſt of theſe Queſtions, the King was inform'd, that a certain Youth, the handſomeſt and lovelieſt in the World, had come over in Company with us. I was preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious that Don <hi>Gregorio</hi> was the Perſon, his Beauty anſwering ſo exactly their Deſcription. The Senſe of the young Gentleman's Danger was now more grievous to me than my own Misfortunes, having been told that thoſe barbarous <hi>Turks</hi> are much fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of a handſome Youth, than the moſt beautiful Woman. The King gave immediate Orders he ſhou'd be brought into his Preſence, asking me whether the Youth deſerv'd the Commendations they gave him. I told him, inſpir'd by ſome good Angel, that the Perſon they ſo much commended, was no Man, but of my own Sex, and withal beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g'd his Permiſſion to have her dreſs'd in a Female Habit, that her Beauty might ſhine in its natural Luſtre, and ſo prevent her Bluſhes, if ſhe ſhou'd ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before his Majeſty in that unbecoming Habit. He conſented, promiſing withal, to give Order next Morning for my Return to <hi>Spain,</hi> to recover my Treaſure. I ſpoke with Don <hi>Gaſpar,</hi> repreſented to
<pb n="1238" facs="tcp:54446:664"/>
him the Danger of appearing a Man, and prevail'd with him to wait on the King that Evening in the Habit of a <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Woman. The King was ſo pleas'd with her Beauty, that he reſolv'd to reſerve her as a Preſent for the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> and fearing the Malice of his Wives in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and the Sollicitations of his own Deſires, he gave her in Charge to ſome of the principal Ladies of the City, to whoſe Houſe ſhe was immediately conducted.</p>
                        <p>This Separation was grievous to us both (for I cannot deny that I love him). Thoſe who have ever felt the Pangs of a parting Love can beſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine the Affliction of our Souls. Next Morning, by the King's Order, I embark'd for <hi>Spain</hi> in this Veſſel, accompany'd by theſe two <hi>Turks</hi> that kill'd your Men, and this <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Renegado that firſt ſpoke to you, who is a Chriſtian in his Heart, and came along with me with a greater Deſire to return to <hi>Spain</hi> than to go back to <hi>Barbary.</hi> The reſt are all <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> who ſerve for Rowers. Their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were to ſet me on Shore with this Renegado, in the Habits of Chriſtians, on the firſt <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ground they ſhould diſcover; but theſe two ravenous and inſolent <hi>Turks,</hi> muſt, contrary to their Order, firſt cruiſe upon the Coaſt, in hopes of taking ſome Prize; being afraid, that if they ſhould firſt ſet us aſhore, ſome Accident might happen to us, and make us diſcover that the Br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>To conclude, Don <hi>Gregorio</hi> remains in Women's Habit among the <hi>Moors,</hi> nor can the Deceit long Protect him from Deſtruction; and here I ſtand ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting, or rather fearing my Fate, which yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

prove unwelcome, I being now weary of Living. Thus, Gentlemen, you have heard the unhappy Paſſages of my Life, I have told you nothing but what is true, and all I have to beg, is that I may die as a Chriſtian; ſince I am innocent of the Crimes of which my unhappy Nation is accus'd. Here ſhe ſtopp'd, and with her Story and her Tears melted the Hearts of many of the Company.</p>
                        <p>The Viceroy, being mov'd with a tender Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, was the firſt to unbind the Cords that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacl'd her fair Hands, when an ancient Pilgrim, who came on board with the Viceroy's Attendants, having with a fix'd Attention minded the Damſel during her Relation, came ſuddenly, and throwing himſelf at her Feet, Oh <hi>Anna Felix,</hi> cry'd he, my dear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Daughter! Behold thy Father <hi>Ricote,</hi> that return'd to ſeek thee, being unable to live without thee, who art the Joy and Support of my Age. Upon this, <hi>Sancho,</hi> who had all this while been ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenly muſing, vex'd at the Uſage he had met with ſo lately, lifting up his Head, and ſtaring the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim in the Face, knew him to be the ſame <hi>Ricote</hi> he had met on the Road the Day he left his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and was likewiſe fully perſwaded, that this was his Daughter, who being now unbound, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd her Father, and joyn'd with him in his Joy and Grief. My Lords, ſaid the old Pilgrim, this is my Daughter, <hi>Anna Felix,</hi> more unhappy in Fortune than in Name, and fam'd as much for her Beauty, as for her Father's Riches. I left my Country to ſeek a Sanctuary for my Age, and having fix'd upon a Reſidence in <hi>Germany,</hi> return'd in this Habit with other Pilgrims to recover my Wealth, which I have effectually done, but I little thought thus unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly to have found my greateſt Treaſure, my deareſt Daughter. My Lords, if it can conſiſt with the Integrity of your Juſtice, to pardon our ſmall
<pb n="1240" facs="tcp:54446:665"/>
Offence, I joyn my Prayers and Tears with her's, to implore your Mercy on our behalf; ſince we never deſign'd you any Injury, and are innocent of thoſe Crimes for which our Nation has juſtly been baniſh'd. Ay, ay, cry'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> (putting in) I know <hi>Ricote</hi> as well as the Begger knows his Diſh, and ſo far as concerns <hi>Anna Felix</hi>'s being his Daughter, I know that's true too; but for all the Story of his Goings-out and Comings-in, and his Intentions, whether they were good, or whether they were bad, I'll neither meddle or make, not I.</p>
                        <p>So uncommon an Accident fill'd all the Company with Admiration, ſo that the General turning to the fair Captain, Your Tears, ſaid he, are ſo prevailing, Madam, that they compel me now to be forſworn. Live, lovely <hi>Anna Felix,</hi> Live as many Years as Heaven has decreed you; and let thoſe raſh and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent Slaves, who alone committed the Crimes bear the Puniſhment of it. With that he gave Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to have the two delinquent <hi>Turks</hi> hang'd up at the Yard's-Arm: But, at the Interceſſion of the Viceroy, their Fault ſhewing rather Madneſs than Deſign, the fatal Sentence was revok'd; the General conſidering at the ſame time, that their Puniſhment in cold Blood wou'd look more like Cruelty than Juſtice.</p>
                        <p>Then they began to conſider how they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve Don <hi>Gaſpar Gregorio</hi> from the Danger he was in; to which purpoſe <hi>Ricote</hi> offer'd to the Value of above a Thouſand Ducats which he had about him in Jewels, to purchaſe his Ranſom. But the readieſt Expedient was thought to be the Propoſal of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Renegado, who offer'd with a ſmall Bark and half a dozen Oars mann'd by Chriſtians to return to <hi>Argiers,</hi> and ſet him at Liberty, as beſt knowing when and where to land, and being acquainted with the Place of his Confinement. The General
<pb n="1241" facs="tcp:54446:665"/>
and the Viceroy demurr'd to this Motion, thro' a Diſtruſt of the Renegado's Fidelity, ſince he might perhaps betray the Chriſtians that were to go along with him. But <hi>Anna Felix</hi> engaging for his Truth, and <hi>Ricote</hi> obliging himſelf to ranſom the Chriſtians if they were taken, the Deſign was reſolv'd upon.</p>
                        <p>The Viceroy went aſhore, committing the <hi>Moriſca</hi> and her Father to Don <hi>Antonio Moreno</hi>'s Care, deſiring him at the ſame time to command his Houſe for any thing that might conduce to their Entertainment; ſuch Sentiments of Kindneſs and good Nature had the Beauty of <hi>Anna Felix</hi> infus'd into his Breaſt.</p>

                        <p>DON <hi>Antonio</hi>'s Lady was extremely pleas'd with the Company of the fair <hi>Moriſca,</hi> whoſe Senſe being as exquiſite as her Beauty, drew all the moſt conſiderable Perſons in the City to viſit her. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> told Don <hi>Antonio</hi> that he cou'd by no means approve the Method they had taken to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe Don <hi>Gregorio,</hi> it being full of Danger, and little or no Probability of Succeſs; but that their ſureſt way wou'd be to have him ſet aſhore in <hi>Barbary,</hi> with his Horſe and Arms, and leave it to him to deliver the Gentleman in ſpight of all the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Power, as Don <hi>Gayferos</hi> had reſcu'd his Wife <hi>Meliſſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra.</hi> Good your Worſhip, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> hearing this, look before you leap. Don <hi>Gayferos</hi> had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

thing but a fair Race for't on dry Land, when he carried her to <hi>France.</hi> But here, an't pleaſe you, tho' we ſhou'd deliver Don <hi>Gregorio,</hi> how the Devil ſhall we bring him over to <hi>Spain</hi> croſs the broad Sea. There's a Remedy for all Things but Death, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> 'tis but having a Bark ready by the Sea-ſide, and then let me ſee what can hinder our getting into it. Ah Maſter, Maſter, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> there's more to be done than a Diſh to waſh, Saying is one Thing, and Doing is another, and for my Part, I like the Renegade very well, he ſeems to me a good honeſt Fellow, and cut out for the Buſineſs. Well, ſaid Don <hi>Antonio,</hi> if the Renegado fails, then the Great Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ſhall embark for <hi>Barbary.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In two Days the Renegado was diſpatch'd away in a fleet Cruiſer of ſix Oars aſide, mann'd with brisk luſty Fellows, and two days after that, the Gallies with the General left the Port, and ſteer'd their Courſe Eaſtwards. The General having firſt engag'd the Viceroy to give him an Account of Don <hi>Gregorio's,</hi> and <hi>Anna Felix</hi>'s Fortune.</p>
                        <p>Now it happen'd one Morning that Don <hi>Quixote</hi> going abroad to take the Air upon the Sea-ſhore, arm'd at all Points, according to his Cuſtom (his Arms, as he ſaid, being his beſt Attire, as Combat was his Refreſhment) he ſpy'd a Knight riding to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, arm'd like himſelf from Head to Foot, with a bright Moon blazon'd on his Shield, who coming within his Hearing, call'd out to him, Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious, and never ſufficiently extoll'd Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote de la Mancha,</hi> I am the Knight of the <hi>White Moon,</hi> whoſe incredible Atchievements, perhaps, have reach'd thy Ears. Lo, I am come to enter into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with Thee, and to compel thee by Dint of Sword, to own and acknowledge my Miſtreſs, (by whatever Name and Dignity ſhe be diſtinguiſh'd) to be, without any Degree of Compariſon, more
<pb n="1243" facs="tcp:54446:666"/>
beautiful than thy <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo.</hi> Now if thou wilt fairly confeſs this Truth, thou freeſt thy ſelf from certain Death, and me from the Trouble of taking or giving thee thy Life. If not, the Conditions of our Combat are theſe. If Victory be on my Side, thou ſhalt be oblig'd immediately to forſake thy Arms, and the Queſt of Adventures, and to return to thy own Home, where thou ſhalt be engag'd to live quietly and peaceably for the Space of one whole Year, without laying Hand on thy Sword, to the Improvement of thy Eſtate, and the Salvation of thy Soul. But if thou com'ſt off Conqueror, my Life is at thy Mercy, my Horſe and Arms ſhall be thy Trophy, and the Fame of all my former Exploits, by the lineal Deſcent of Conqueſt, be veſted in thee as Victor. Conſider what thou haſt to do, and let thy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer be quick; for my Diſpatch is limited to this very Day.</p>
                        <p>Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was amaz'd and ſurpriz'd as much at the Arrogance of the Knight of the <hi>White Moon</hi>'s Challenge, as at the Subject of it; ſo with a ſolemn and auſtere Addreſs, Knight of the <hi>White Moon,</hi> ſaid he, whoſe Atchievements have as yet been kept from my Knowledge, 'tis more than probable, that you have never ſeen the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious <hi>Dulcinea;</hi> for had you ever view'd her Perfections, you had there found Arguments e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to convince you that no Beauty, paſs'd, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or to come, can parallel hers, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without giving you directly the Lie, I only tell thee, Knight, thou art miſtaken; and this Poſition I will maintain by accepting your Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, on your Conditions, except that Article of your Exploits deſcending to me; for, not knowing what Character your Actions bear, I ſhall reſt ſatisfy'd with the Fame of my own, by
<pb n="1244" facs="tcp:54446:667"/>
which, ſuch as they are, I am willing to abide. And ſince your Time is ſo limited, chuſe you Ground, and begin your Career as ſoon as you will, and expect to be met with: A fair Field and no Favour.</p>
                        <p>While the two Knights were thus adjuſting the Preliminaries of Combat, the Vice-Roy who had been inform'd of the Knight of the <hi>White Moon</hi>'s Appearance near the City Walls, and his parly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> haſten'd to the Scene of Battle, not ſuſpecting it to be any thing but ſome new Device of Don <hi>Antonio Moreno,</hi> or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Several Gentlemen, and Don <hi>Antonio</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt accompany'd him thither. They arriv'd juſt as Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was wheeling <hi>Reſinarde</hi> to fetch his Career, and ſeeing 'em both ready for the Onſet, he interpos'd, deſiring to know the Cauſe of the ſudden Combat. The Knight of the <hi>White Moon</hi> told him there was a Lady in the Caſe, and briefly repeated to his Excellency what paſs'd between him and Don <hi>Quixote.</hi> The Vice-Roy whiſper'd Don <hi>Antonio,</hi> and ask'd him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he knew that Knight of the <hi>White Moon,</hi> and whether their Combat was not ſome jocular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to impoſe upon Don <hi>Quixote.</hi> Don <hi>Antonio</hi> anſwer'd poſitively, that he neither knew the Knight, nor whether the Combat were in Jeſt or in Earneſt. This put the Vice-Roy to ſome Doubt whether he ſhould not prevent their Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but being at laſt perſwaded that it muſt be a Jeſt at the Bottom, he withdrew. Valorous Knights, ſaid he, if there be no <hi>Medium</hi> between Confeſſion and Death, but Don <hi>Quixote</hi> be ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to deny, and you the Knight of the <hi>White Moon</hi> as obſtinately to urge, I have no more to ſay; the Field is free, and the Lord have mercy on ye.</p>

His Adverſary was no leſs forward; for ſetting Spurs to his Horſe, which was much the ſwifter, he met Don <hi>Quixote</hi> before he had ran half his Career, ſo forcibly, that without making uſe of his Lance, which 'tis thought he lifted up on Purpoſe, he overthrew the Knight of <hi>la Mancha,</hi> and <hi>Roſinante,</hi> both coming to the Ground with a terrible Fall.</p>
                        <p>The Knight of the <hi>White Moon</hi> got immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon him, and clapping the Point of his Lance to his Face, Knight, cry'd he, you are van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd, and a dead Man, unleſs you immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fulfil the Conditions of your Combat. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> bruis'd and ſtunn'd with his Fall, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out lifting up his Beaver, anſwer'd in a faint hollow Voice, as if he had ſpoke out of a Tomb, <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo</hi> is the moſt beautiful Woman in the World, and I the moſt unfortunate Knight upon the Earth. 'Twere unjuſt that ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ſhould ſuffer through my Weakneſs. No, pierce my Body with thy Lance, Knight, and let my Life expire with my Honour. Not ſo ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous neither, reply'd the Conquerour, let the Fame of the Lady <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo</hi> remain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and unblemiſh'd; provided the Great Don <hi>Quixote</hi> return home for a Year, as we agreed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Combate, I am ſatisfy'd. The Vice-Roy and Don <hi>Antonio</hi> with many other Gentlemen were Witneſſes to all theſe Paſſages, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to this Propoſal; to which Don <hi>Quixote</hi> anſwer'd, that upon Condition he ſhould be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd nothing to the Prejudice of <hi>Dulcinea</hi> he
<pb n="1246" facs="tcp:54446:669"/>
would, upon the Faith of a true Knight, be punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual in the Performance of every Thing elſe. This Acknowledgment being made, the Knight of the <hi>White Moon</hi> turn'd about his Horſe, and ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Viceroy rode at a hand-Gallop into the City, whither Don <hi>Antonio</hi> follow'd him at the Viceroy's Requeſt, to find who he was, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
                        <p>Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was lifted up, and upon taking off his Helmet, they found him pale, and in a cold Sweat. As for <hi>Roſinante</hi> he was in ſo ſad a Flight, that he could not ſtir for the preſent. Then as for <hi>Sancho,</hi> he was in ſo heavy a taking, that he knew not what to do, nor what to ſay; he was ſometimes perſwaded he was in a Dream, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he fancy'd this rueful Adventure was all Witchcraft and Inchantment. In ſhort, he found his Maſter diſcomſited in the Face of the World, and bound to good Behaviour, and to lay aſide his Arms for a whole Year. Now he thought his Glory eclips'd, his Hopes of Greatneſs va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd into Smoak, and his Maſter's Promiſes, like his Bones, put out of Joynt by that curſed Fall, which he was afraid had at once crippl'd <hi>Roſinante</hi> and his Maſter. At laſt the vanquiſh'd Knight was put into a Chair, which the Viceroy had ſent for, for that Purpoſe, and they carry'd him into Town, accompany'd by the Viceroy, who had a great Curioſity to know who this Knight of the <hi>White Moon</hi> was, that had left Don <hi>Quixote</hi> in ſo ſad a Condition.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. LXV.</hi> An Account of the Knight of the <hi>White Moon,</hi> Don <hi>Gregorio</hi>'s Enlargement, and other Paſſages.</head>
                        <p>DON <hi>Antonio Moreno</hi> follow'd the Knight of the <hi>White Moon</hi> to his Inn, whither he was attended by a troubleſome Rabble of Boys. The Knight being got to his Chamber, where his Squire waited to take off his Armour, Don <hi>Antonio</hi> came in, declaring that he would not be ſhook off, till he had diſcover'd who he was. The Knight finding that the Gentleman would not leave him; Sir, ſaid he, ſince I lie under no Obligation of concealing my ſelf, if you pleaſe, while my Man diſarms me, you ſhall hear the whole Truth of the Story.</p>
                        <p>You muſt know, Sir, I am call'd the Batchelor <hi>Carraſco,</hi> I live in the ſame Town with this Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> whoſe unaccountable Frenzy has mov'd all his Neighbours, and me among the reſt, to endeavour ſome Means to cure his Madneſs; in order to which, believing that Reſt and Eaſe would prove the ſureſt Remedy, I bethought my ſelf of this preſent Stratagem, and about three Months ago, in all the Equipage of a Knight-Errant, under the Title of the Knight of the <hi>Mirrours,</hi> I met him on the Road, fix'd a Quarrel upon him, and the Conditions of our Combat were as you have heard already. But Fortune
<pb n="1248" facs="tcp:54446:670"/>
then declar'd for him, for he unhors'd and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd me, and ſo I was diſappointed: He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted his Adventures, and I return'd home ſhamefully, very much hurt with my Fall. But willing to retrieve my Credit, I made this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Attempt, and now have ſucceeded. For I know him to be ſo nicely punctual in whatever his Word and Honour is engag'd for, that he will undoubtedly perform his Promiſe. This, Sir, is the Sum of the whole Story, and I beg the Favour of you to conceal me from Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote,</hi> that my Project may not be ruin'd the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Time, and that the honeſt Gentleman, who is naturally a Man of good Parts, may recover his Underſtanding. Oh! Sir, reply'd Don <hi>Antonio,</hi> what have you to anſwer for in robbing the World of the moſt diverting Folly, that ever was expos'd among Mankind. Conſider, Sir, that his Cure can never benefit the Publick half ſo much as his Diſtemper. But I am apt to believe, Sir Batchelor, that his Madneſs is too firmly fix'd for your Art to remove, and (Heaven forgive me) I can't forbear wiſhing it may be ſo; for by Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Cure we not only loſe his good Company, but the Drolleries and comical Humours of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho Pança</hi> too, which are enough to cure Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly it ſelf of the Spleen. However, I promiſe to ſay nothing of the Matter; though I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently believe, Sir, your Pains will be to no Purpoſe. <hi>Carraſco</hi> told him that having ſucceeded ſo far, he was oblig'd to cheriſh better Hopes, and asking Don <hi>Antonio</hi> if he had any farther Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to command him, he took his Leave, and packing up his Armour on a Carriage-Mule, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently mounted his Charging-Horſe, and leaving the City that very Day, poſted homewards, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="1249" facs="tcp:54446:670"/>
no Adventure on the Road worth a Place in this faithful Hiſtory.</p>
                        <p>Don <hi>Antonio</hi> gave an Account of the Diſcourſe he had had with <hi>Carraſco</hi> to the Vice-Roy, who was vex'd to think that ſo much pleaſant Diverſion was like to be loſt to all thoſe that were acquainted with the Don's Follies.</p>
                        <p>Six Days did Don <hi>Quixote</hi> keep his Bed, very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, ſullen, and out of Humour, and full of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and black Reflections on his fatal Overthrow. <hi>Sancho</hi> was his Comforter, and among other his Crumbs of Comfort, My dear Maſter, quoth he, chear up, come pluck up a good Heart, and be thankful for coming off no worſe. Why, a Man has broke his Neck with a leſs Fall, and you han't ſo much as a broken Rib. Conſider, Sir, that they that win, ſometimes muſt loſe; we muſt not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways look for Bacon, where you ſee the Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ks. Come, Sir, cry a Fig for the Doctor, ſince you won't need him this Bout; let us jog home fair and ſoftly, without thinking any more of ſaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring up and down no Body knows whither in Queſt of Adventures and bloody Noſes. Why, Sir, I am the greateſt Loſer, an you go to that, though 'tis you that are in the worſt Pickle. 'Tis true, I was weary of being a Governor, and gave over all Thoughts that Way; but yet I never parted with my Inclination of being an Earl; and now if you miſs being a King, by caſting off your Knight-Errantry, poor I may go whiſtle for my Earldom. No more of that, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> I ſhall only retire for a Year, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſume my honourable Profeſſion, which will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly ſecure me a Kingdom, and thee an Earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Heav'n grant it may, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> and no Miſchief betide us. Hope well and have well, ſays the Proverb.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="1250" facs="tcp:54446:671"/>Don <hi>Antonio</hi> coming in, broke off the Diſcourſe, and with great Signs of Joy calling to Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> Reward me, Sir, cry'd he, for my good News; Don <hi>Gregorio</hi> and the Renegado are ſafe arriv'd, they are now at the Viceroy's Palace, and will be here this Moment. The Knight was a little reviv'd at this News; truly, Sir, ſaid he, to Don <hi>Antonio,</hi> I could almoſt be ſorry for his good Fortune, ſince he has foreſtall'd the Glory I ſhould have acquir'd in releaſing by the Strength of my Arm, not only him, but all the Chriſtian Slaves in <hi>Barbary.</hi> But whither am I tranſported, Wretch that I am? am I not miſerably conquered, ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully overthrown! forbidden the Paths of Glory for a whole long tedious Year? What, ſhould I boaſt, who am fitter for a Diſtaff than a Sword! No more of that, quoth <hi>Sancho.</hi> Better my Hog dirty at home, than no Hog at all. To Day for thee, and to Morrow for me. Never lay this ill Fortune to Heart; he that's down to Day, may be up to Morrow, unleſs he has a Mind to lie a bed. Hang Bruiſes, ſo Rouſe, Sir, and bid Don <hi>Gregorio</hi> welcome to <hi>Spain;</hi> for by the Hurry in the Houſe, I believe he's come; and ſo it happen'd, for Don <hi>Gregorio</hi> having paid his Duty to the Viceroy, and given him an Account of his Delivery, was juſt arriv'd at Don <hi>Antonio</hi>'s with the Renegado, very impatient to ſee <hi>Anna Felix.</hi> He had chang'd the Female Habit, he wore when he was freed, for one ſuitable to his Sex, which he had from a Captive who came along with him in the Veſſel, and appear'd a very amiable and handſome Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, though not above eighteen Years of Age. <hi>Ricote</hi> and his Daughter went out to meet him, the Father with Tears, and the Daughter with a joyful Modeſty. Their Salutation was reſerv'd without an Embrace, their Love being too refin'd
<pb n="1251" facs="tcp:54446:671"/>
for any looſe Behaviour: But their Beauties ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd every Body; Silence was emphatical in their Joys, and their Eyes ſpoke more Love than their Tongues could expreſs. The Renegado gave a ſhort Account of the Succeſs of his Voyage, and Don <hi>Gregorio</hi> briefly related the Shifts he was put to among the Women in his Confinement, which ſhew'd his Wit and Diſcretion to be much above his Years. <hi>Ricote</hi> gratify'd the Ship's Crew very nobly, and particularly the Renegado, who was once more receiv'd into the Boſom of the Church, having with due Penance and ſincere Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance purify'd himſelf from all his former Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs.</p>
                        <p>Some few Days after, the Viceroy, in concert with Don <hi>Antonio,</hi> took ſuch Meaſures as were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, to get the Baniſhment of <hi>Ricote</hi> and his Daughter repeal'd, judging it no Inconvenience to the Nation, that ſo juſt and orthodox Perſons ſhould remain among 'em. Don <hi>Antonio</hi> being oblig'd to go to Court about ſome other Matters, offer'd to ſollicit in their behalf, hinting to him, that, through the Interceſſion of Friends and more powerful Bribes, many difficult Matters were brought about there to the Satisfaction of the Parties. There is no relying upon Favour and Bribes in our Buſineſs ſaid <hi>Ricote,</hi> who was by, for the great Don <hi>Bernardino de Vel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He is an <hi>Argus</hi> in his Miniſtry, and by his watchful Eyes has
<pb n="1252" facs="tcp:54446:672"/>
diſcover'd the moſt ſecret Springs of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chination, and reſolving to prevent the Danger which the whole Kingdom was in, from ſuch a powerful Multitude of inbred Foes, he took the moſt effectual Means; for after all, lopping off the Branches may only prune the Tree, and make the poiſonous Fruit ſpring faſter, but to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it from the Root, proves a ſure Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; nor can the Great <hi>Philip</hi> the Third be too much extoll'd; firſt, for his Heroick Reſolution in ſo nice and weighty an Affair, and then for his Wiſdom in entruſting Don <hi>Bernardino de Velaſco</hi> with the Execution of this Deſign. Well, when I come to Court, ſaid Don <hi>Antonio</hi> to <hi>Ricote,</hi> I will however uſe the moſt adviſeable Means, and leave the reſt to Providence. Don <hi>Gregorio</hi> ſhall go with me to comfort his Parents, that have long mourn'd for his Abſence. <hi>Anna Felix</hi> ſhall ſtay here with my Wife, or in ſome Monaſtery; and as for honeſt <hi>Ricote,</hi> I dare engage the Viceroy will be ſatisfy'd to let him remain under his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection till he ſees how I ſucceed. The Viceroy conſented to all this; but Don <hi>Gregorio</hi> fearing the worſt, was unwilling to leave his fair Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs; however, conſidering that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to her after he had ſeen his Parents, he yielded to the Propoſal, and ſo <hi>Anna Felix</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd with Don <hi>Antonio</hi>'s Lady, and <hi>Ricote</hi> with the Viceroy.</p>
                        <p>Two Days after Don <hi>Quixote</hi> being ſomewhat recover'd, took his Leave of Don <hi>Antonio,</hi> and having caus'd his Armour to be laid on <hi>Dapple,</hi> he ſet forwards on his Journey home. <hi>Sancho</hi> thus being forc'd to trudge after him on Foot. On the other Side, Don <hi>Gregorio</hi> bid adieu to <hi>Anna Felix,</hi> and their Separation, though but for a while, was attended with Floods of Tears, and all
<pb n="1253" facs="tcp:54446:672"/>
the Exceſs of paſſionate Sorrow. <hi>Ricote</hi> offer'd him a thouſand Crowns, but he refus'd them, and only borrow'd five of Don <hi>Antonio</hi> to repay him at Court.</p>

                        <p>DON <hi>Quixote</hi> as he went out of <hi>Barcelona,</hi> caſt his Eyes on the Spot of Ground where he was overthrown. Here once <hi>Troy</hi> ſtood, ſaid he; here my unhappy Fate, and not my Cowardize, depriv'd me of all the Glories I had purchas'd; here Fortune, by an unexpected Reverſe, made me ſenſible of her Turns and Fickleneſs. Here my Exploits ſuffer'd a total Eclipſe; and, in ſhort, here fell my Happineſs, never to riſe again. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> hearing his Maſter thus dolefully paraphraſing on his Misfortune, Good Sir, quoth he, 'tis as much the Part of great Hearts to have Patience when the World frowns upon 'em, as to be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful when all goes well: And I judge of it by my ſelf; for if when I was a Governour I was merry, now I am but a poor Squire afoot I am not ſad. And indeed I have heard ſay, that this ſame She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing they call Fortune, is a whimſical freakiſh drunken Quean, and blind into the Bargain; ſo that ſhe neither ſees what ſhe does, nor knows whom ſhe raiſes, nor whom ſhe caſts down. Thou
<pb n="1254" facs="tcp:54446:673"/>
art very much a Philoſopher, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> thou talk'ſt very ſenſibly. I wonder how thou cam'ſt by all this; but I muſt tell thee there is no ſuch Thing as Fortune in the World; nor does any Thing that happens here below of Good or Ill come by Chance, but by the particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of Heaven; and this makes good the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, That every Man may thank himſelf for his own Fortune. For my Part, I have been the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer of mine, but for Want of uſing the Diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I ought to have us'd, all my preſumptuous E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difice ſunk and tumbl'd down at once. I might well have conſider'd, that <hi>Roſinante</hi> was too weak and feeble to withſtand the Knight of the <hi>White Moon</hi>'s huge and ſtrong-built Horſe. However, I wou'd needs adventure, I did the beſt I cou'd, and was overcome. Yet tho' it has coſt me my Honour, I have not loſt, nor can I loſe my Integrity to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form my Promiſe: When I was a Knight-Errant, valiant and bold, the Strength of my Arms and my Actions gave a Reputation to my Deeds; and now I am no more than a diſmounted Squire, the Performance of my Promiſe ſhall give a Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to my Words. Trudge on then, Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> and let us get home to paſs the Year of our Probation. In that Retirement we ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover new Vigour to return to that, which is never to be forgotten by me, I mean the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Arms. Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> 'tis no ſuch Pleaſure to beat the Hoof as I do, that I ſhou'd be for large Marches. Let us hang up this Armour of yours upon ſome Tree, in the Room of one of thoſe Highway-Men that hang thereabouts in Cluſters, and when I am got upon <hi>Dapple</hi>'s Back, we will ride as faſt as you pleaſe; for to think I can mend my Pace, and foot it all the Way, is what you muſt excuſe me in. Thou haſt ſpoken
<pb n="1255" facs="tcp:54446:673"/>
to the Purpoſe <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> let my Arms be hung up for a Trophy, and underneath, or about 'em, we will carve on the Bark of the Trees the ſame Inſcription, which was written near the Trophy of <hi>Orlando</hi>'s Arms.</p>
                        <q>
                           <l>Let none but he theſe Arms diſplace,</l>
                           <l>Who dares <hi>Orlando</hi>'s Fury Face.</l>
                        </q>
                        <p>Why, this is as I'd have it, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> and were it not that we ſhall want <hi>Roſinante</hi> upon the Road, 'twere not amiſs to leave him hanging too. Now I think better on't, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> neither the Armour nor the Horſe ſhall be ſerv'd ſo. It ſhall never be ſaid of me, <hi>For good Service, bad Reward.</hi> Why that's well ſaid, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> for indeed 'tis a Saying among Wiſe Men, that the Fault of the Aſs muſt not be laid on the Pack-ſaddle, and therefore, ſince in this laſt Job you your ſelf were in Fault, e'en puniſh your ſelf, and let not your Fury wreck it ſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your poor Armour, bruis'd and batter'd with doing you Service, nor upon the Tameneſs of <hi>Roſinante,</hi> that good condition'd Beaſt, nor yet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Tenderneſs of my Feet, requiring them to travel more than they ought.</p>
                        <p>They paſs'd that Day, and four more after that, in ſuch Kind of Diſcourſe, without meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Thing that might interrupt their Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; but on the fifth Day, as they enter'd into a Country-Town, they ſaw a great Company of People at an Inn-Door, being got together for Paſtime, as being a Holiday. As ſoon as Don <hi>Quixote</hi> drew near, he heard one of the Country-men cry to the reſt, look ye now, we'll leave it to one of theſe two Gentlemen that are coming this Way, they know neither of the Parties.
<pb n="1256" facs="tcp:54446:674"/>
Let either of 'em decide the Matter. That I will with all my Heart, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and with all the Equity imaginable; if you'll but ſtate the Caſe right to me. Why, Sir, ſaid the Country-man, the Buſineſs is this, One of our Neighbours here in this Town, ſo fat, and ſo heavy, that he weighs eleven <hi>Arrobas,</hi> or eleven Quarters of a Hundred, (for that's the ſame Thing) has chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leng'd another Man o' this Town, that weighs not half ſo much, to run with him a hundred Paces with equal Weight. Now he that gave the Challenge, being ask'd how they ſhou'd make equal Weight, demands that the other who weighs but five Quarters of a Hundred, ſhou'd carry a hundred and a half of Iron, and ſo the Weight, he ſays, will be equal. Hold, Sir, cry'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> before Don <hi>Quixote</hi> cou'd anſwer, this Buſineſs belongs to me, that come ſo lately from being a Governour, and a Judge, as all the World knows; I ought to give Judgment in this doubtful Caſe. Do then, with all my Heart, Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> for I am not ſit to give Crumbs to a Cat, my Brain is ſo diſturb'd, and out of order. <hi>Sancho</hi> having thus got leave, and all the Country-men ſtanding about him, gaping to hear him give Sentence. Brothers, quoth he, I muſt tell you, that the fat Man is in the wrong Box, there's no manner of Reaſon in what he asks; for if, as I always heard ſay, he that is challeng'd may chooſe his Weapons, there's no Reaſon that he ſhould chooſe ſuch as may encumber him, and hinder him from getting the better of him that defy'd him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis my Judgment, that he who gave the Challenge, and is ſo big and ſo fat, ſhall cut, pare, ſlice, or ſhave off a hundred and ſifty Pounds of his Fleſh, here and there, as he thinks
<pb n="1257" facs="tcp:54446:674"/>
fit; and then being reduc'd to the Weight of the t'other, both Parties may run their Race upon equal Terms. By fore George, quoth one of the Country-People that had heard the Sentence, this Gentleman has ſpoken like one of the Saints in Heaven; he has given Judgment like a Caſuiſt; but I warrant the Fat Squob loves his Fleſh too well to part with the leaſt Sliver of it, much leſs will he part with a Hundred and half. Why then, quoth another Fellow, the beſt Way will be not to let 'em run at all; for then <hi>Lean</hi> need not venture to ſprain his Back by running with ſuch a Load; and <hi>Fat</hi> need not cut out his pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd ſides into Collops: So let half the Wager be ſpent in Wine, and lets take theſe Gentlemen to the Tavern that has the beſt, <hi>and lay the Cloak upon me when it rains.</hi> I return ye Thanks, Gentlmen, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> but cannot ſtay a Moment, for diſmal Thoughts and Diſaſters force me to appear unmannerly, and to travel at an uncommon Rate; and ſo ſaying he clapp'd Spurs to <hi>Roſinante,</hi> and mov'd forwards, leaving the People to deſcant on his ſtrange Figure, and the rare Parts of his Groom, for ſuch they took <hi>Sancho</hi> to be. If the Man be ſo wiſe, quoth another of the Country-Fellows to the reſt, bleſs us! What ſhall we think of the Maſter! 'Ill hold a Wager, if they be going to ſtudy at <hi>Salamanca,</hi> they will come to be Lord Chief-Juſtices in a trice; for there's nothing more eaſie, 'tis but Studying and Studying again, and having a little Favour, and good Luck; and when a Man leaſt Dreams of it, ſee, he ſhall find himſelf with a Judge's Gown upon his Back, or a Biſhop's Mitre upon his Head.</p>
                        <p>That Night the Maſter and the Man took up their Lodging in the Middle of a Field, under
<pb n="1258" facs="tcp:54446:675"/>
the Roof of the open Sky; and the next Day, as they were on their Journey, they ſaw coming towards 'em, a Man a-foot with a Wallet about his Neck, and a Javelin or Dart in his Hand, juſt like a Foot-Poſt: This Man mended his Pace when he came near Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt running, came, with a great deal of Joy in his Looks, and embrac'd Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s right Thigh, for he cou'd reach no higher. My Lord, Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> cry'd he, oh! how heartily glad my Lord Duke will be when he underſtands you are coming again to his Caſtle, for there he is ſtill with my Lady Dutcheſs. I don't know you Friend, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> nor can I imagine who you ſhou'd be, unleſs you tell me your ſelf. My Name is <hi>Toſilos,</hi> an't pleaſe your Honour; I am my Lord Duke's Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the ſame who wou'd not fight with you about <hi>Donna Rodriguez</hi>'s Daughter. Bleſs me, cry'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> is it poſſible you ſhould be the Man whom thoſe Enemies of mine, the <hi>Magicians,</hi> transform'd into a Lacquey, to deprive me of the Honour of that Combat? Softly, good Sir, reply'd the Footman, there was neither In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment nor Transformation in the Caſe. I was as much a Footman when I enter'd the Liſts, as when I went out; and it was becauſe I had a Mind to marry the young Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that I refus'd to fight. But I was ſadly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed; for when you were gone, my Lord Duke had me ſoundly bang'd, for not doing as he order'd me in that Matter; and the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot was this, <hi>Donna Rodriguez</hi> is pack'd away to ſeek her Fortune, and the Daughter is ſhut up in a Nunnery. As for me, I am going to <hi>Barcelona,</hi> with a Packet of Letters from my Lord to the Viceroy. However, Sir, if you
<pb n="1259" facs="tcp:54446:675"/>
pleaſe to take a Sup, I have a Gourd full of good Wine at your Service. 'Tis a little hot, I muſt own, but 'tis pure, and I have ſome excellent Cheeſe, that will make it go down, I'll warrant ye. I take you at your Word, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I am no proud Man, leave Ceremonies to the Church, and ſo drink, honeſt <hi>Toſilos,</hi> in ſpight of all the Inchanters in the <hi>Indies.</hi> Well <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> thou art certainly the veryeſt Glutton that ever was, and the ſillieſt Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head in the World, elſe thou would'ſt conſider that this Man thou ſeeſt here, is inchanted, and a ſham-Lacquey.

I ſee it plain enough, and tell him of it often enough, but what does it ſignify? Eſpecially now that he's all in the Dumps, for having been worſted by the Knight of the <hi>White Moon. Toſilos</hi> begg'd of <hi>Sancho</hi> to tell him that Story; but <hi>Sancho</hi> ſaid it would not be handſome to let his Maſter ſtay for him, but that next time they met he'd tell him the whole Matter.

                        <p>IF Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was much diſturb'd in Mind before his Overthrow, he was much more diſquieted after it. While he ſtay'd for his Squire under a Tree, a thouſand Thoughts crouded into his Head, like Flies into a Honey-Pot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>; ſometimes he ponder'd on the Means to free <hi>Dulcinea</hi> from Inchantment, and at others, on the Life he was to lead during his involuntary Retirement. In this brown Study, <hi>Sancho,</hi> came up to him, crying up <hi>Toſilos</hi> as the honeſteſt Fellow, and the moſt Gentleman-like Footman in the World. Is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> thou ſhould'ſt ſtill take that Man for a real Lacquey? Haſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got how thou ſaw'ſt <hi>Dulcinea</hi> converted and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd into the Reſemblance of a ruſtick Wench, and the Knight of the <hi>Mirrours</hi> into the Batchelor <hi>Ca raſco;</hi> and all this by the Negromantick Arts of thoſe evil-minded Magicians, that perſecute me? But laying this aſide, prethee tell me, did'ſt
<pb n="1261" facs="tcp:54446:676"/>
thou not ask <hi>Toſilos</hi> what became of <hi>Altiſidora:</hi> Whether ſhe bemoan'd my Abſence, or diſmiſs'd from her Breaſt thoſe amorous Sentiments that diſturb'd her when I was near her? Faith and Troth, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> my Head ran on ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, and I was too well employ'd to think of ſuch fooliſh Stuff. Body of me! Sir, are you now in a Mood to ask about other Folks Thoughts, eſpecially their Love-thoughts too? Look you, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> there's a great deal of Difference between thoſe Actions that proceed from Love, and thoſe that are the Effect of Gratitude. It is poſſible a Gentleman ſhould be not at all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous, but ſtrictly ſpeaking, he cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful. 'Tis very likely that <hi>Altiſidora</hi> lov'd me well, ſhe preſented me, as thou know'ſt, with three Night-Caps; ſhe wept, and took on when I went away; curs'd me, abus'd me, and in ſpight of Modeſty, gave a Looſe to her Paſſion; all Tokens that ſhe was deeply in Love with me, for the Anger of Lovers commonly vents it ſelf in Curſes. It was not in my Power to give her any Hopes, nor had I any coſtly Preſent to beſtow on her; for all I have reſerv'd, is for <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinea,</hi> and the Treaſures of a Knight-Errant are but Fairy-Gold, and a deluſive Good. So all I can do, is only to remember the unfortunate Fair, without Prejudice however to the Rights of my <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> whom thou greatly injur'ſt <hi>Sancho,</hi> by delaying the Accompliſhment of the Penance that muſt free the poor Lady from Miſery.

<pb n="1262" facs="tcp:54446:677"/>
Back-ſide will ſignifie a Straw to the Diſ-inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Inchanted. Sir, 'tis as if we ſhou'd ſay, If your Head akes, Anoint your Shins. At leaſt, I dare be ſworn, that in all the Stories of Knight-Errantry, you have thumb'd over, you never knew Flogging unbewitch any Body.

We'll drink the liquid Cryſtal, ſometimes out of the Fountains, and ſometimes from the purl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Brooks, and the ſwift gliding Streams The Oaks, the Cork Trees, and Cheſnut-Trees, will afford us both Lodging and Diet.

So ſhall we become famous, not only while we live, but make our Loves Eternal as our Songs. As I live, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> this Sort of Life nicks me to an Hair; and I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that if the Batchelor, <hi>Samſon Carraſco</hi> and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Nicholas</hi> have but once a Glimpſe of it, they'll e'en turn Shepherds too; nay, 'tis well if the Curate does not put in for one among the reſt, for he's a notable Joaker, and merrily inclined. That was well thought on, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote:</hi> And then if the Batchelor will make one among us, as I doubt not but he will, he may call himſelf the Shepherd <hi>Samſonio,</hi> or <hi>Carraſcon;</hi> and Maſter <hi>Nicholas, Niculoſo,</hi> as formerly old <hi>Boſcan</hi> call'd himſelf <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For my Part, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I don't think of any other Name for mine but <hi>Tereſona,</hi> that will fit her fat Sides full well, and is taken from her Chriſtian Name too, ſo when I come to mention her in my Verſes, every Body will know her to be my Wife, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend my Honeſty, as being one that is not for
<pb n="1264" facs="tcp:54446:678"/>
picking another Man's Lock: As for the Curate, he muſt be contented without a Sheperdeſs, for good Example's ſake. And for the Batchelor, let him take his own Choice, if he means to have one. Bleſs me, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote!</hi> What a Life ſhall we lead! What a Melody of Oaten Reeds, and <hi>Zamora</hi> Bag-pipes ſhall we have reſounding in the Air! What Intermixture of Tabors, Morrice-Bells, and Fiddles! and if to all the different In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments we add thoſe Kind of Flutes which we call the <hi>Albogues,</hi> we ſhall have all Manner of paſtoral Muſick. What are the <hi>Albogues,</hi> quoth <hi>Sancho?</hi> They, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> are a Sort of Inſtruments made of Braſs-Plates, rounded like Candleſticks: The one ſhutting into the other, there ariſes through the holes, or ſtops, and the Trunk or Hollow, an odd Sound, which, if not very grateful, or harmonious, is however not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together diſagreeable, but does well enough with the Ruſticity of Pipe and Tabor. You muſt know, the Word is <hi>Mooriſh</hi> or <hi>Arabick,</hi> as indeed are all thoſe in our <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> that begin with an <hi>Al,</hi> as <hi>Almoaza, Almorzar, Alhombra, Alguaſil, Alucema, Almacen, Alcanzia,</hi> and the like, which are not very many. And we have alſo three <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Words in our Tongue that end in <hi>I;</hi> and they are <hi>Barcequi, Zaquicami</hi> and <hi>Maravedi;</hi> for as to <hi>Alheli</hi> and <hi>Alſaqui,</hi> they are as well known to be <hi>Arabick</hi> by their beginning with Al, as their ending in I. I cou'd not forebear telling thee ſo much by the Bye, thy <hi>Quere</hi> about <hi>Albogue</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving brought it into my Head. There is one Thing more that will go a great Way towards making us compleat in our new Kind of Life; and that's Poetry; thou know'ſt I am ſomewhat given that Way, and the Batchelor <hi>Carraſco</hi> is a moſt accompliſh'd Poet; to ſay nothing of the

Curate; tho' I'll hold a Wager he is a Dabbler in it too, and ſo is Maſter <hi>Nicholas,</hi> I dare ſay; for all your Barbers are notable Scrapers and Song<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. For my Part, I'll complain of Abſence, thou ſhalt celebrate thy own Loyalty and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, the Shepherd <hi>Carraſcon</hi> ſhall expoſtulate on his Sheperdeſs's Diſdain, and the Paſtor <hi>Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambro</hi> chuſe any other Subject that will fit his Circumſtances; and ſo every Thing will be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd to our Hearts Content.

I'll ne'er be without a wooden Spoon in my Pocket. Oh, how many of them will I make! What Garlands, and what pretty paſtoral Fancies will I contrive! which tho' they mayn't recommend me for Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, will make me paſs for a clever Fellow.

One Pair of Heels is worth two Pair of Hands, and we muſt watch as well as pray. No more old Saws, <hi>Sancho,</hi> cry'd Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> any one of theſe is enough to make us know thy Meaning. I have told thee often enough not to be ſo laviſh of thy Proverbs; but 'tis all loſt upon thee: I preach in a Deſart, my Mother whips me, and I whip the Top.

the Kettle Black-Arſe.—You chide me for ſpeaking Proverbs, and yet you bring 'em out two at a Time.

But no more at this Time, it grows late, let us leave the Road a little, and take up our Quarters yonder in the Fields; to Morrow will be a new Day. They did accordingly, and made a ſlender Meal, as little to <hi>Sancho</hi>'s liking as his hard Lodging; which brought the Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips of Knight-Erranting freſh into his Thoughts; and made him wiſh for the better Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he had ſometimes found, as at Don <hi>Diego</hi>'s, <hi>Camacho</hi>'s, and Don <hi>Antonio</hi>'s Houſes; but he conſider'd after all, that it cou'd not be always fair Weather, nor was it always foul; ſo he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took himſelf to his Reſt till Morning, and his Maſter to the uſual Exerciſe of his roving I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations.</p>

                        <p>THE Night was pretty dark, tho' the Moon ſtill kept her Place in the Sky; but it was in ſuch a Part as oblig'd her to be inviſible to us; for now and then Madam <hi>Diana</hi> takes a Turn to the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> and then the Mountains in Black, and the Vallies in Darkneſs, mourn her Ladiſhip's Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.

<pb n="1267" facs="tcp:54446:679"/>
to the Temptations of a ſecond. <hi>Sancho,</hi> indeed did not enjoy a <hi>ſecond;</hi> but from a different Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; for he uſually made but one Nap of the whole Night, which was owing to the Soundneſs of his Conſtitution, and his Unexperience of Cares that lay ſo heavy upon Don <hi>Quixote.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid the Knight, after he had pull'd the Squire till he had wak'd him too, I am amaz'd at the Inſenſibility of thy Temper. Thou art certainly made of Marble or ſolid Braſs, thou lieſt without either Motion or Feeling. Thou ſleep'ſt while I wake, thou ſing'ſt while I mourn, and while I am ready to faint for Want of Suſtenance, thou art lazy and unwieldy with meer Gluttony. It is the Part of a good Servant, to ſhare in the Afflictions of his Maſter. Obſerve the Stillneſs of the Night, and the ſolitary Place we are in. 'Tis Pity ſuch an Opportunity ſhou'd be loſt in Sloth, and unactive Reſt; Rouſe for Shame, ſtep a little aſide, and with a good Air, and a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Heart ſcore me up ſome three or four Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Laſhes upon thy Back, towards the Diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting of <hi>Dulcinea.</hi> This I make my earneſt Entreaty, being reſolv'd never to be rough with thee again upon this Account; for I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs thou can'ſt lay a heavy Hand on a Man upon Occaſion. When that Performance is over, we'll paſs the Remainder of the Night in Singing, I of Abſence, and thou of Conſtancy, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin thoſe paſtoral Exerciſes, which are to be our Employment at Home. Sir, anſwer'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> do you take me for a Monk or Frier, that I ſhou'd ſtart up in the middle of the Night, and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline my ſelf at this Rate? Or do you think it ſuch an eaſie Matter to ſcourge and clapper-claw my Back one Moment, and fall a Singing the next? Look you, Sir, ſay not a Word more of
<pb n="1268" facs="tcp:54446:680"/>
this Whipping; for as I love my Fleſh, you'll put me upon making ſome raſh Oath or other that you won't like, and then if the bare bruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my Coat wou'd do you any Good, you ſhou'd not have it, much leſs the currying of my Hide, and ſo let me go to Sleep again. Oh obdurate Heart, cry'd Don <hi>Quixote!</hi> Oh, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Squire! Oh Nouriſhment and Favours ill beſtow'd! Is this my Reward for having got thee a Government, and my good Intentions to get thee an Earldom, or an Equivalent at leaſt. Which I dare engage to do when this Year of our Obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is elaps'd; for in ſhort, <hi>Poſt tenebras ſpero lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem.</hi> That I don't underſtand, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but this I very well know, that while I am aſleep. I feel neither Hope nor Deſpair; I am free from Pain at leaſt, if not from Pleaſure. Now Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings light on him that firſt invented this ſame Sleep. It covers a Man all over, Thoughts and all, like a Cloak; 'tis Meat for the Hungry, Drink for the Thirſty, Heat for the Cold, and Cold for the Hot. 'Tis the current Coin that purchaſes all the Pleaſures of the World cheap; and the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance that ſets the King and the Shepherd, the Fool and the Wiſe-Man even. There is only one Thing, which Somebody once put into my Head, that I diſlike in Sleep; 'tis, that it reſembles Death, there's very little Difference between a Man in his firſt Sleep, and a Man in his laſt Sleep. Moſt elegantly ſpoken, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote!</hi> Thou haſt much outdone any Thing I ever heard thee ſay before, which confirms me in the Truth of one of thy own Proverbs: <hi>Birth is much, but Breeding more.</hi> God's me! Maſter of mine, cry'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> I'm not the only he now that threads Proverbs, for you tack 'em together faſter than I do, I think. I ſee no Difference but that yours come in Seaſon,
<pb n="1269" facs="tcp:54446:680"/>
and mine out of Seaſon, but for all that, they are all but Proverbs.</p>
                        <p>Thus they were employ'd, when their Ears were alarm'd with a Kind of a hoarſe and grunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Noiſe, that ſpread it ſelf over all the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Valleys. Preſently Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ſtarted up on his Legs, and laid his Hand to his Sword; as for <hi>Sancho,</hi> he immediately ſet up ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments about him, clapping the Bundle of Armour on one Side, and fortifying the other with the Aſs's Pack-ſaddle, and then he neſted himſelf all up, and ſquatted under <hi>Dapple</hi>'s Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, where he lay ſnug, and panting, as full of Fears as his Maſter of Surprize; and every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Noiſe grew louder as the Cauſe of it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd, to the Terror of the one, at leaſt; for as for t'other, 'tis ſufficiently known what his Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour was.</p>
                        <p>Now the Occaſion was this: Some Fellows were driving a Herd of above ſix hundred Swine to a certain Fair; and with their grunting and ſqueaking, the filthy Beaſts made ſuch a horrible Noiſe that Don <hi>Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> were almoſt ſtunn'd with it, and cou'd not imagine whence it proceeded. But at length the Knight and Squire ſtanding in their Way, the rude Swiniſh Animals came thronging up all in a Body, and without any Reſpect of Perſons, ſome running between the Knight's Legs, and ſome between the Squire's, threw down both Maſter and Man, having not only inſulted <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Intrenchments, but alſo thrown down <hi>Roſinante:</hi> And having thus broke in upon 'em, on they went, and bore down all before 'em, overthrowing Pack-ſaddle, Armour, Knight, Squire, Horſe and all; crouding, treading and trampling over them all at a horrid rate. <hi>Sancho</hi> was the firſt that made a ſhift to recover his Legs,
<pb n="1270" facs="tcp:54446:681"/>
and having by this time found out what the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was, he call'd to his Maſter to lend him his Sword, and ſwore he would ſtick at leaſt half a dozen of thoſe rude Porkers immediately. No, no, my Friend, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> let 'em e'en go; Heaven inflicts this Diſgrace upon my guilty Head, for 'tis but a juſt Puniſhment that Dogs ſhou'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, Hornets ſting, and vile Hogs trample on a vanquiſh'd Knight-Errant. And belike, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that Heaven ſends the Fleas to ſting, the Lice to bite, and Hunger to famiſh us poor Squires, for keeping theſe vanquiſh'd Knights Company. If we Squires were the Sons of thoſe Knights, or any ways related to 'em, why then ſomething might be ſaid for our bearing a Share of their Puniſhment, tho' it were to the third and fourth Generation. But what have the <hi>Pança</hi>'s to do with the <hi>Quixotes?</hi> Well, let's to our old Places again, and ſleep out the little that's left of the Night. To Morrow is a new Day. Sleep <hi>Sancho,</hi> cry'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> ſleep, for thou wert born to ſleep but I, who was deſign'd to be ſtill waking, intend before <hi>Aurora</hi> uſhers in the Sun, to give a Looſe to my Thoughts, and vent my Conceptions in a Madrigal that I made laſt Night, unknown to thee. Methinks, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> a Man can't be in great Affliction, when he can turn his Brain to the making of Verſes. Therefore, you may ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſify on, as long as you pleaſe, and I'll ſleep it out as much as I can. This ſaid, he laid himſelf down on the Ground, as he thought beſt, and hunching himſelf cloſe together, fell faſt aſleep, without any Diſturbance from either Debts, Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhip, or any Care whatſoever. On the other ſide. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> leaning againſt the Trunk of a Beech, or a Cork-Tree (for 'tis not determin'd by <hi>Cid Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>

                        <p>The many Tears as well as Sighs that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd this muſical Complaint, were a Sign that the Knight had deeply lay'd to Heart his late Defeat, and the Abſence of his <hi>Dulcinea.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now Day came on, and the Sun darting his Beams on <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Face, at laſt awak'd him; whereupon, rubbing his Eyes, and yawning, and ſtretching his drowſy Limbs, he perceiv'd the Havock that the Hogs had made in his Baggage, which made him wiſh, not only the Herd, but Somebody elſe at the Devil and further. In ſhort, the Knight and the Squire both ſet forward on their Journey, and about the Cloſe of the Evening they diſcover'd ſome half a Score Horſemen, and four or five Fellows on Foot, making directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> at the Sight, felt a ſtrange Emotion in his Breaſt, and <hi>Sancho</hi> fell a
<pb n="1272" facs="tcp:54446:682"/>
ſhivering from Head to Foot; for they perceiv'd that theſe Strangers were provided with Spears and Shields, and other warlike Implements. Whereupon the Knight turning to the Squire, Ah! <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid he, were it lawful for me at this Time, to practiſe Feats of Arms, and had I my Hand at Liberty from my Promiſe, what a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sight ſhou'd I eſteem this Squadron that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches! But now—however, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my preſent Apprehenſions, Things may fall out better than we expect.</p>
                        <p>By this Time the Horſemen with their Lances advanc'd, came cloſe up to them without ſpeaking a Word, and encompaſſing Don <hi>Quixote</hi> in a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacing Manner, with their Points levell'd to his Back and Breaſt, one of the Footmen by laying his Finger upon his Mouth, ſignify'd to Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote,</hi> that he muſt be mute; then taking <hi>Roſinante</hi> by the Bridle, he led him out of the Road, while the reſt of the Footmen had ſecured <hi>Sancho</hi> and <hi>Dapple,</hi> and drove 'em ſilently before 'em. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> attempted twice or thrice to ask the Cauſe of this Uſage, but he no ſooner began to open, but they were ready to run the Heads of their Spears down his Throat. Poor <hi>Sancho</hi> far'd worſe yet; for as he offer'd to ſpeak, one of the Foot-Guards gave him a Jagg with a Goad, and ſerv'd <hi>Dapple</hi> as bad, though the poor Beaſt had no Thought of ſaying a Word.</p>
                        <p>As it grew Night they mended their Pace, and then the Darkneſs encreas'd the Fears of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Knight and Squire; eſpecially when every Minute their Ears were tormented with theſe or ſuch like Words. On, on ye <hi>Troglodytes;</hi> Silence, ye <hi>Barbarian</hi> Slaves; Vengeance, ye <hi>Anthropophagi;</hi> Grumble not, ye <hi>Scythians;</hi> Be blind, ye Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Polyphemes,</hi> ye devouring Lions.

Here's one Miſchief on the Neck of another. When a Man's down, down with him. I wou'd compound for a good dry Beating, and glad to 'ſcape ſo too. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was no leſs perplex'd, not being able to imagine the Reaſon either of their hard Uſage, or ſcurrilous Language, which hitherto promis'd but little Good. At laſt, after they had rode about an Hour in the Dark, they came to the Gates of a Caſtle, which Don <hi>Quixote</hi> preſently knowing to be the Duke's, where he had ſo lately been, Heaven bleſs me, cry'd he, what do I ſee! Was not this the Manſion of Civility and Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity! But thus the Vanquiſh'd are doom'd to ſee every Thing frown upon 'em. With that the two Priſoners were led into the great Court of the Caſtle, and found ſuch ſtrange Preparations made there, as encreas'd at once their Fear, and their Amazement; as we ſhall find in the next Chapter.</p>

                        <p>ALL the Horſe-men alighted, and the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſnatching up Don <hi>Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> in their Arms hurry'd 'em into the Court-Yard that was illuminated with above a hundred Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="1274" facs="tcp:54446:683"/>
ſix'd in huge Candle-ſticks; and about all the Galleries round the Court, were plac'd above five hundred Lights, inſomuch that all was Day in the Midſt of the Darkneſs of the Night. In the Middle of the Court there was a Tomb, rais'd ſome two Yards from the Ground, with a large Pall of black Velvet over it, and round about it a hundred Tapers of Virgins-Wax, ſtood burning in Silver-Candleſticks. Upon the Tomb lay the Body of a young Damſel, who, though to all Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, dead, was yet ſo beautiful, that Death it ſelf ſeem'd lovely in her Face. Her Head was crown'd with a Garland of fragrant Flowers, and ſupported by a Pillow of Cloath of Gold, and in her Hands that laid acroſs her Breaſt, was ſeen a Branch of that yellow Palm, that us'd of old to adorn the Triumphs of Conquerors. On one Side of the Court, there was a Kind of a Theatre ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, on which two Perſonages ſate in Chairs, who by the Crowns upon their Heads, and Scepters in their Hands, were, or at leaſt appear'd to be Kings. By the Side of the Theatre, at the Foot of the Steps by which the Kings aſcended, two other Chairs were plac'd, and thither Don <hi>Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> were led, and caus'd to ſit down; the Guards that conducted 'em continuing ſilent all the while, and making their Priſoners underſtand by awful Signs that they muſt alſo be ſilent. But there was no great Occaſion for that Caution; for their Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize was ſo great, that it had ty'd up their Tongues with Amazement.</p>
                        <p>At the ſame Time, two other Perſons of Note aſcended the Stage, with a numerous Retinue, and ſeated themſelves on two ſtately Chairs by the two Theatrical Kings. Theſe Don <hi>Quixote</hi> preſently knew to be the Duke and Dutcheſs, at
<pb n="1275" facs="tcp:54446:683"/>
whoſe Palace he had been ſo nobly entertain'd. But what he diſcover'd as the greateſt Wonder, was that the Corps upon the Tomb was the Body of the fair <hi>Altiſidora.</hi>

Upon this a certain Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer enter'd the Court, and coming up to <hi>Sancho,</hi> he clapp'd over him a black Buckram-Frock, all figur'd over with Flames of Fire, and taking off his Cap, he put on his Head a Kind of Mitre, ſuch as is worn by thoſe who undergo publick Penance by the Inquiſition; whiſpering him in the Ear at the ſame Time, that if he did but offer to open his Lips, they would put a Gag in his Mouth, or murder him to rights. <hi>Sancho</hi> view'd himſelf over from Head to Foot, and was a little ſtartl'd to ſee himſelf all over in Fire and Flames, but yet ſince he did not feel himſelf burn, he car'd not a Farthing. He pull'd off his Mitre, and found it pictur'd over with Devils, but he put it on again, and bethought himſelf, that ſince neither the Flames burn'd him, nor the Devils ran away with him, 'twas well enough. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> alſo ſtedfaſtly ſurvey'd him, and in the Midſt of all his Apprehenſions, could not forbear ſmiling to ſee what a ſtrange Figure he made. And now in the midſt of that profound Silence, while every Thing was mute, and Expectation moſt atrentive, a ſoft and charming Symphony of Flutes, that ſeem'd to iſſue from the Hollow of the Tomb, agreeably fill'd their Ears. Then there appear'd at the Head of the Monument, a young Man extremely hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and dreſs'd in a <hi>Roman</hi> Habit, who to the

Judge of Hell! Thou to whom the Decrees of Fate, unſcrutable to Mortals, are reveal'd, in order to reſtore this Damſel to Life, open and declare 'em immediately, nor delay the promis'd Felicity of her Return to comfort the drooping World.</p>
                        <p>Scarce had <hi>Minos</hi> finiſh'd his Charge, but <hi>Rha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damanthus</hi> ſtarting up, proceed, ſaid he, ye Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Officers of the Houſhold, ſuperiour and inferiour, high and low; proceed one afrer another, and mark me <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Face with twenty four Twitches, give him twelve Pinches, and run ſix Pins into his Arms and Back-ſide; for <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſidora</hi>'s Reſtoration depends on the Performance of this Ceremony. <hi>Sancho</hi> hearing this, could hold out no longer, but bawling out, Body of me! cry'd he, I'll as ſoon turn <hi>Turk,</hi> as give you Leave to do all this. You ſhall put no Countenance of mine upon any ſuch Mortification. What the Devil can the ſpoiling of my Face ſignify to the reſtoring of this Damſel?

And here's <hi>Altiſidora</hi> too, drops off of one Diſtemper or other, and preſently poor <hi>Sancho</hi> muſt be pull'd by the Handle of his Face, his Skin fill'd with Oilet-holes, and his Arms pinch'd black and blue, to ſave her from the Worms. No, no, you muſt not think to put Tricks upon Travellers. An old Dog will learn no Tricks. Relent, cry'd <hi>Rhadamanthus</hi> aloud, thou Tiger, ſubmit proud <hi>Nimrod,</hi> ſuffer and be ſilent or thou dy'ſt. No Impoſſibility is requir'd from thee; and therefore pretend nor to expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late on the Severity of thy Doom. Thy Face ſhall receive the Twitches, thy Skin ſhall be pinch'd, and groan under the Penance. Begin, I ſay, ye
<pb n="1278" facs="tcp:54446:685"/>
Miniſters of Juſtice, execute my Sentence, or upon the Honour of a Man, ye ſhall curſe the Hour ye were born. At the ſame Time ſix old <hi>Duena's</hi> or Waiting-women appear'd in the Court, marching in a formal Proceſſion one after another, four of 'em wearing Spectacles, and all with their right Hands held aloft, and their Wriſts, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Faſhion, about four Inches bare, to make their Hands ſeem the longer! <hi>Sancho</hi> no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſpy'd them, but roaring out like a Bull, do with me what you pleaſe, cry'd he, let a Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of mad Cats lay their Claws on me, as they did on my Maſter in this Caſtle, drill me through with ſharp Daggers, tear the Fleſh from my Bones with red-hot Pincers, I'll bear it with Patience, and ſerve your Worſhips. But the Devil ſhall run away with me at once, before I'll ſuffer old wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-women to lay a Finger upon me. Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote,</hi> upon this broke Silence, have Patience, my Son, cry'd he, and reſign thy ſelf to theſe Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates with Thanks to Heaven, for having endow'd thy Perſon with ſuch a Gift, as to releaſe the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted, and raiſe the Dead from the Grave.</p>

                           </gap>witch'd and pinch'd him decently, and he bore it all with unſpeakable Patience. But when they came to prick him with Pins, he could contain no longer, but ſtarting up in a pelting Chafe,
<pb n="1279" facs="tcp:54446:685"/>
ſnatch'd up one of the Torches that ſtood near him, and ſwinging it round, put all the Women and the reſt of his Tormenters to their Heels. Avaunt, cry'd he, ye Imps of the Devil, d'ye think that my Backſide is made of Braſs, or I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be your Maſter's Martyr.</p>
                        <p>At the ſame Time, <hi>Altiſidora,</hi> who could not but be tir'd with lying ſo long upon her Back, began to turn herſelf on one Side, which was no ſooner perceiv'd by the Spectators, but they all ſet up the Cry, <hi>She lives, ſhe lives!</hi> Altiſidora <hi>lives!</hi> And then <hi>Rhadamanthus</hi> addreſſing himſelf to <hi>Sancho,</hi> deſir'd him to be pacify'd, for now the wonderful Recovery was effected.

If you've a Mind to make an End of me at once, can't you as well tie a handſome Stone about my Neck, and tip me over into a Well. Better make an End of me at once, than have me loaded ſo every foot like a Pack-horſe with other Folks Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.

Altiſidora</hi> live! The Duke and Dutcheſs got up, and with <hi>Minos</hi> and <hi>Rhadamanthus</hi> accompany'd by Don <hi>Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho,</hi> went all in a Body to receive <hi>Altiſidora,</hi> and handed her, down from the Tomb. She pretending to faint, bow'd to the Duke and Dutcheſs, and alſo to the two Kings, but caſting a ſhy Look upon Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven forgive that hard-hearted lovely Knight, ſaid ſhe, whoſe Barbarity has made me an Inhabitant of the other World, for ought I know a thouſand Years. But to thee, ſaid ſhe, turning to <hi>Sancho,</hi> to thee the moſt compaſſionate Squire that the World contains, I return my Thanks for my Change from Death to Life; in Acknowledgment of which, ſix of the beſt Smocks I have ſhall be chang'd into Shirts for thee, and if they are not ſpick and ſpan new, yet they are all as clean as a Penny. <hi>Sancho</hi> pull'd off his Mitre, put his Knee to the Ground, and kiſs'd her Hand. The Duke commanded, that they ſhould return him his Cap, and inſtead of his flaming Frock, to give him his Gaberdine; but <hi>Sancho</hi> begg'd of his Grace, that he might keep the Frock and Mitre, to carry into his own Country, as a Relick of that wonderful Adventure. The Dutcheſs ſaid, he ſhould have 'em, for he knew ſhe was always one of his beſt Friends. Then the Duke order'd the Company to clear the Court, and retire to their reſpective Lodgings, and that Don <hi>Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> ſhould be conducted to their Apartments.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. LXX.</hi> Which comes after the ſixty ninth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ſeveral Particulars, neceſſary for the Illuſtration of this Hiſtory.</head>
                        <p>THAT Night <hi>Sancho</hi> lay in a Truckle-bed in Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Chamber, a Lodging not much to the Squire's liking, being very ſenſible that his Maſter would diſturb him with imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Chat all Night long; and this Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he found himſelf not rightly diſpos'd for, his late Penance having taken him quite off the talking Pin. And a Hovel with good ſound Sleep had been more agreeable to his Circumſtances, than the moſt ſtately Apartments in ſuch trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Company; and indeed his Apprehenſions prov'd ſo right, that his Maſter was ſcarcely laid when he began to open.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid he, what is your Opinion of this Night's Adventure? Great and mighty is the force of Love when heighten'd by Diſdain, as the Teſtimony of your own Eyes may convince you in the Death of <hi>Altiſidora</hi> 'Twas neither a Dart, a Dagger, nor any Poiſon that brought her to her Fate, but ſhe expir'd through the meer Senſe of my Diſdain of her Affection. I had not car'd a Pin, anſwer'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> though ſhe had dy'd of the Pip, ſo ſhe had but let me alone. I never cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her, nor ſlighted her in my born-days, and for my Part, I muſt ſtill think it ſtrange, that the
<pb n="1282" facs="tcp:54446:687"/>
Life and well-doing of <hi>Altiſidora</hi> a whimſical, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotty Gentlewoman ſhould depend upon the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing of <hi>Sancho Pança.</hi> But there are Inchanters and Witchcrafts in this World that's certain, from which good Heaven deliver me; for 'tis more than I can do my ſelf. But now, Sir, let me ſleep, I beſech you; for if you trouble me with any more Queſtions, I'm reſolv'd to leap out of the Window. I'll not diſturb thee, honeſt <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> ſleep; if the Smart of thy late Torture will let thee! No Pain anſwer'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> can be compar'd to the Abuſe my Face ſuffer'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'twas done by the worſt of ill-natur'd Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, I mean old Waiting-women: The Devil take 'em, quo' I, and ſo good Night! I want a good Nap to ſet me to righrs, and ſo once again, pray let me ſleep. Do ſo, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and Heaven be with thee Thereupon they both fell aſleep, and while they are aſleep <hi>Cid Hamet</hi> takes the Opportunity to tell us the Motives that put the Duke and Dutcheſs upon this odd Compound of Extravagancies, that has been laſt related. He ſays, that the Batchelor <hi>Carraſco</hi> meditating Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge for having been defeated by Don <hi>Quixote</hi> when he went by the Title of the Knight of the <hi>Mirrours,</hi> reſolv'd to make another Attempt in hopes of better Fortune, and therefore having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood where Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was by the Page that brought the Letters and Preſent to <hi>Sanch</hi>'s Wife, he furniſh'd himſelf with a freſh Horſe and Arms, and had a White Moon painted on his Shield; his Accoutrements were all pack'd up on a Mule, and, leſt <hi>Thomas Cecial</hi> his former Attendant ſhould be known by Don <hi>Quixote</hi> or <hi>Sancho,</hi> he got a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-Fellow to wait on him as a Squire. Coming to the Duke's Caſtle, he was inform'd that the Knight was gone to the Tournament at <hi>Saragoſa;</hi>
                           <pb n="1283" facs="tcp:54446:687"/>
the Duke giving the Batchelor an Account alſo how pleaſantly they had impos'd upon him with the Contrivance for <hi>Dulcinea</hi>'s Diſinchantment, to be effected at the Expence of <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Poſteriors. Finally, he told him how <hi>Sancho</hi> had made his Maſter believe that <hi>Dulcinea</hi> was transform'd into a Country-Wench by the Power of Magick; and how the Dutcheſs had perſwaded <hi>Sancho</hi> that he was deluded himſelf, and <hi>Dulcinea</hi> inchanted in good earneſt. The Batchelor, though he could not forbear laughing, was nevertheleſs ſtruck with Wonder at this Mixture of Cunning and Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city in the Squire, and the uncommon Madneſs of the Maſter. The Duke then made it his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt that if he met with the Knight, he ſhould call at the Caſtle as he return'd, and give him an Account of his Succeſs, whether he vanquiſh'd him or not. The Batchelor promis'd to obey his Commands, and departing in ſearch of Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote,</hi> he found him not at <hi>Saragoſa,</hi> but travelling farther met him at laſt, and had his Revenge as we have told you. Then taking the Duke's Caſtle in his Way home, he gave him an Account of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and Conditions of the Combat, and how Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was repairing homewards, to fulfil his Engagement of returning to his Village for a Year, as it was incumbent on the Honour of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry to perform, and in this Space, the Batchelor ſaid he hop'd the poor Gentleman might recover his Senſes, declaring withal that the Concern he had upon him to ſee a Man of his Parts in ſuch a diſtracted Condition, was the only Motive that could put him upon ſuch an Attempt. Upon this he return'd home, there to expect Don <hi>Quixote</hi> who was coming after him. This Information engag'd the Duke, who was never to be tir'd with the Humours of the Knight and the Squire, to take this
<pb n="1284" facs="tcp:54446:688"/>
Occaſion to make more Sport with 'em; he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd all the Roads thereabouts, eſpecially thoſe that Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was moſt likely to take, to be laid by a great many of his Servants, who had Orders to bring him to the Caſtle right or wrong.</p>
                        <p>They met him accordingly, and ſent their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter an Account of it, whereupon all Things being prepar'd againſt his coming, the Duke caus'd the Torches and Tapers to be all lighted round the Court, and <hi>Altiſidora</hi>'s Tragi-comical Interlude was acted with the Humours of <hi>Sancho Pança,</hi> the whole ſo to the Life, that the Counterfeit was hardly diſcernible. <hi>Cid Hamet</hi> adds, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd thoſe that play'd all theſe Tricks were as mad as thoſe they were impos'd upon: And that the Duke and Dutcheſs were within a Hair's Breadth of being thought Fools themſelves, for taking ſo much pains to make Sport with the Weakneſs of two poor ſilly Wretches.</p>
                        <p>Now to return to our two Adventurers, the Morning found one of 'em faſt aſleep, and the other broad awake tranſported with his wild Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations. They thought it Time to riſe, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Don, for the Bed of Sloath was never agreeable to him, whether vanquiſh'd or victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Altiſidora</hi> whom Don <hi>Quixote</hi> ſuppos'd to have been rais'd from the Dead, did that Day deck her Head with the ſame Garland ſhe wore upon the Tomb, and in a Gown of white Taffety flower'd with Gold, thrown careleſly over her, her disſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel'd Locks flowing negligently on her Shoulders, ſhe enter'd Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Chamber, ſupporting her ſelf with an Ebony-Stick.</p>
                        <p>The Knight was ſo ſurpriz'd and amaz'd at this unexpected Apparition, that he was ſtruck dumb, and not knowing how to behave himſelf, he ſlunk
<pb n="1285" facs="tcp:54446:688"/>
down under the Bed-Cloaths, and cover'd himſelf over Head and Ears. However, <hi>Altiſidora</hi> plac'd her ſelf in a Chair cloſe by his Bed's-head, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a profound Sigh; To what an Extremity of Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune and Diſtreſs, ſaid ſhe, in a ſoft and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Voice, are young Ladies of my Virtue and Quality reduc'd, when they thus trample upon the Rule of Modeſty, and without Regard to Virgin-Decency are forc'd to give their Tongues a Looſe, and betray the Secrets of their Hearts! Alas! Noble Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> I am one of thoſe unhappy Perſons over-rul'd by my Paſſion; but yet ſo reſerv'd and patient in my Sufferings, that Silence broke my Heart, and my Heart broke in Silence. 'Tis now two Days, moſt inexorable and Marble-hearted Man, ſince the Senſe of your ſevere Uſage and Cruelty brought me to my Death, or ſomething ſo like it, that every one that ſaw me, judg'd me to be dead. And had not Love been compaſſionate, and aſſign'd my Recovery on the Sufferings of this kind Squire, I had ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd in the other World. Truly, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> Love might e'en as well have made Choice of my Aſs for that Service, and he would have obliged me a great deal more. But pray, good Miſtreſs, tell me one Thing now, and ſo Heaven provide you a better natur'd Sweet-heart than my Maſter; what did you ſee in the other World? What Sort of Folks are there in Hell? For there I ſuppoſe you have been; for thoſe that die of themſelves muſt needs go to that Summer-houſe. To tell you the Truth, reply'd <hi>Altiſidora,</hi> I fancy I could not be dead out-right, becauſe I was not got ſo far as Hell; for, had I got in, I'm ſure I ſhould ne'er have been allow'd to have got out again. I got to the Gates indeed, where I found a round Dozen of Devils in their Breeches and Waſte-coats,
<pb n="1286" facs="tcp:54446:689"/>
playing at Tennis with flaming Rackets; they wore flat Bands with ſcollop'd Lace, and Ruffles of the ſame. Their Arms were naked four Fingers Breadth to give an Air to their Wriſts, and make their Hands look the longer. But what I moſt wonder'd at, was, that inſtead of Tenniſ-balls, they made uſe of Books that were every whit as light, and ſtuff'd with Wind and Flock, or ſuch Kind of Trumpery. This was indeed moſt ſtrange and wonderful, but, what ſtill amaz'd me more, I found, that contrary to the Cuſtom of Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, among whom, the gaining Party at leaſt is in good Humour, and the Loſers only angry, theſe Helliſh Toſſers of Books of both ſides did nothing but fret, fume, ſtamp, curſe and ſwear moſt horribly as if they had been all Loſers.</p>
                        <p>That's no Wonder at all, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> for your Devils, whether they play or no, win or loſe, they can never be contented. That may be, ſaid <hi>Altiſidora;</hi> but another Thing that I admire (I then admir'd I would ſay) was, that the Ball would not bear a ſecond Blow, but at every Stroke they were oblig'd to change Books, ſome of 'em new, ſome old, which I thought very ſtrange. And one Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident that happen'd upon this I can't forget. They tos'd up a new Book fairly bound, and gave it ſuch a ſmart Stroke, that the very Guts flew out of it, and all the Leaves were ſcatter'd about. Then cry'd one of the Devils to another, look, look, what Book is that? 'Tis the Second Part of the Hiſtory of Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> ſaid the other; not that which was compos'd by <hi>Cid Hamet,</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the firſt, but by a certain <hi>Arragonian,</hi> who profeſſes himſelf a Native of <hi>Tordeſillas.</hi> Away with it, cry'd the firſt Devil, down with it, plunge it to the loweſt Pit of Hell, where I may never ſee it more. Why, is it ſuch ſad ſtuff, ſaid the
<pb n="1287" facs="tcp:54446:689"/>
other? Such intolerable Stuff, cry'd the firſt Devil, that if I and all the Devils in Hell ſhould ſet our Heads together to make it worſe, it were paſt our Skill. The Devils continu'd their Game, and ſhatter'd a World of other Books, but the Name of Don <hi>Quixote</hi> that I ſo paſſionately ador'd, confin'd my Thoughts only to that Part of the Viſion which I told you. It could be nothing but a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to be ſure, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> for I am the only Perſon of that Name, now in the Univerſe, and that very Book is tos'd about here at the very ſame rate, never reſting in a Place, for every Body has a Fling at it. Nor am I concern'd that any Phantom aſſuming my Name, ſhould wander in the Shades of Darkneſs or in the Light of this World, ſince I am not the Perſon of whom that Hiſtory treats. If it be well writ, faithful and authentick, it will live Ages; but if it be bad, 'twill have but a bad Journey from its Birth to the Grave of Oblivion. <hi>Altiſidora</hi> was then going to renew her Expoſtulations and Complaints againſt Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> had not he thus interrupted her. I have often caution'd you, Madam, ſaid he, of fixing your Affections upon a Man who is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely uncapable of making a ſuitable Return. It grieves me to have a Heart obtruded upon me, when I have no Entertainment to give it, but bare cold Thanks. I was only born for <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo,</hi> and to her alone the Deſtinies (if ſuch there be) have devoted my Affection: So 'tis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>reſumption for any other Beauty to imagine ſhe can diſplace her, or but ſhare the Poſſeſſion ſhe holds in my Soul. This I hope may ſuffice to take away all Foundation from your Hopes, and to recal your Modeſty and re-inſtate it in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Bounds, for nothing is to be expected from a Man in Impoſſibilities.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="1288" facs="tcp:54446:690"/>Upon hearing this, Death of my Life! Cry'd <hi>Altiſidora,</hi> putting on a violent Paſſion, thou Lump of Lead, thou with a Soul of Morter, and a Heart as little and as hard as the Stone of an Olive, more ſtubborn than a fullen Plough-driver or a Carrier's Horſe that will never go out of his Road, I have a good Mind to tear your Eyes out, as deep as they are in your Head. Why, thou beaten Swaſh-buckler, thou Rib-roaſted Knight of the Cudgel, haſt thou the Impudence to think that I dy'd for Love of thy Lanthorn-Jaws. No, no Sir Tiffany, all that you have ſeen this Night has been Counterfeit, for I would not ſuffer the Pain of a Flea-bite, much leſs that of dying, for ſuch a Dromedary as thou art. Troth! Laſs I believe thee, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> for all theſe Stories of People dying for Love are meer Tales of a roaſted Horſe. They tell you they'll dye for Love, but the Devil a-bit. Truſt to that and be laugh'd at.</p>
                        <p>Their Diſcourſe was interrupted by the coming in of the Harper, Singer, and Compoſer of the Stanza's that were perform'd in the Court the Night before. Sir Knight, ſaid he to Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote,</hi> making a profound Obeiſance, let me beg the Favour of being number'd among your moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Servants, 'tis an Honour which I have long been ambitious to receive, in regard of your great Renown, and the Value of your Atchievements. Pray Sir, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> let me know who you are, that I may proportion my Reſpects to your Merits. The Spark gave him to underſtand, he was the Perſon that made and ſung the Verſes he heard the laſt Night. Truly, Sir, ſaid Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote,</hi> you have an excellent Voice; but I think your Poetry was little to the Purpoſe; for what Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion pray have the Stanza's of <hi>Garcilaſſo</hi> to this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's
<pb n="1289" facs="tcp:54446:690"/>
Death? Oh! Sir, never wonder at that, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the Muſician, I do but as other Brothers of the Quill: All the upſtart Poets of the Age do the ſame, and every one writes what he pleaſes, how he pleaſes, and from whom he pleaſes, whether it be to the Purpoſe or no; for let 'em write and ſet to Muſick what they will, though never ſo impertinent and abſur'd, there is a Thing call'd poetical Licence, that is our Warrant, and a Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, and Refuge for Nonſenſe, among all the Men of Jingle and Metre.</p>
                        <p>Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was going to anſwer, but was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by the coming in of the Duke and Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs, who improving the Converſation made it very pleaſant for ſome Hours, and <hi>Sancho</hi> was ſo full of his odd Conceits and arch Wipes, that the Duke and Dutcheſs were at a Stand which to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire moſt, his Wit or his Simplicity. After that, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> begg'd Leave for his Departure that very Day, alledging that Knights in his unhappy Circumſtances were rather qualify'd for an humble Cottage than a Palace. They freely comply'd with his Requeſt, and the Dutcheſs deſir'd to know if <hi>Altiſidora</hi> had yet attain'd to any Share of his Favour. Madam, anſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> I muſt freely tell your Grace, that I am confident all this Damſel's Diſeaſe proceeds from nothing elſe in the World but Idleneſs. So nothing in Nature can be better Phyſick for her Diſtemper than to be continually employ'd in ſome innocent and decent Things. She has been pleas'd to inform me, that Bone lace is much worn in Hell; and ſince with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt ſhe knows how to make it, let that be her Task, and I'll engage the tumbling of her Bobbins to and again, will ſoon toſs her Love out of her Head, take my Word for't; this is my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and my Advice. And mine too, quoth
<pb n="1290" facs="tcp:54446:691"/>
                           <hi>Sancho,</hi> for I never knew any of your Bonelace-makers die for Love, nor any other young Wench that had any Thing elſe to do; I know it by my ſelf. When I am hard at Work, with a Spade in my Hand, I no more think of Pig'ſnyes (my own dear Wife I mean), than I do of my dead Cow, though I love her as the Apple of my Eye. You ſay well, <hi>Sancho,</hi> anſwer'd the Dutcheſs, and I'll take care that <hi>Altiſidora</hi> ſhall not want Employment for the future; ſhe underſtands her Needle, and I'm reſolv'd ſhe ſhall make uſe on't. Madam, ſaid <hi>Altiſidora,</hi> I ſhall have no Occaſion for any Remedy of that nature; for the Senſe of the Severity and ill Uſage that I met with from that Vagabond Monſter, will without any other Means ſoon raze him out of my Memory. In the mean Time, I beg your Grace's Leave to retire, that I may no longer behold, I won't ſay his woeful Figure, but his ugly and abominable Countenance. Theſe Words, ſaid the Duke, put me in Mind of the Proverb, <hi>After railing comes forgiving. Altiſidora</hi> holding her Handkerchief to her Eyes, as it were to dry her Tears, and then making her Honours to the Duke and Dutcheſs, went out of the Room. Alackaday! Poor Girl, cry'd <hi>Sancho.</hi> I know what will be the End of thee, ſince thou art fall'n into the Hands of that ſad Soul, that mercileſs Maſter of mine, with a Crabtree-Heart, as tough as any Oak. Woe be to thee, a'faith! Had'ſt thou fall'n in Love with this ſweet Face of mine, Body of me, thou had'ſt met with a Cock of the Game. The Diſcourſe ended here. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> dreſs'd, din'd with the Duke and Dutcheſs, and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that Afternoon.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. LXXI.</hi> What happen'd to Don <hi>Quixote</hi> and his Squire in their way home.</head>
                        <p>THE vanquiſh'd Knight-Errant continu'd his Journey, equally divided between Grief and Joy; the Thought of his Overthrow ſometimes ſunk his Spirits, but then the Aſſurance he had of the Virtue lodg'd in <hi>Sancho,</hi> by <hi>Altiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora</hi>'s Reſurrection, rais'd them up again; and yet after all, he had much ado to perſwade himſelf that the amorous Damſel was really dead. As for <hi>Sancho,</hi> his Thoughts were not at all of the pleaſing Kind; on the contrary, he was mightily upon the Sullen, becauſe <hi>Altiſidora</hi> had bilk'd him of the Smocks ſhe promis'd him; and his Head running upon that, Faith and Troth, Sir, quoth he, I have the worſt Luck of any Phyſician un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Cope of Heaven; other Doctors kill their Patients, and are paid for their Pains; and yet they are at no farther Touble than ſcrawling two or three cramp Words for ſome phyſical Slip-ſlop, which the Pothecaries are at all the Pains to make up. Now here am I, that ſave People from the Grave at the Expence of my own Hide, pinch'd, clapperclaw'd, run through with Pins, and whipp'd like a Top, and yet the Devil a Croſs I get by the Bargain. But if ever they catch me a Curing any Body o' this Faſhion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I have my Fee before-hand, may I be ſerv'd as I have been for nothing. Odsdiggers! they
<pb n="1292" facs="tcp:54446:692"/>
ſhall pay Sauce for't; no Money no Cure; the Monk lives by his Singing; and I can't think Heav'n would make me a Doctor, without allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me my Fees. You're in the right, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and <hi>Altiſidora</hi> has done unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily in the diſappointing you of the Smocks. Though you muſt own that the Virtue by which you work theſe Wonders was a free Gift, and coſt you nothing to learn, but the Art of Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. For my Part, had you demanded your Fees for Diſinchanting <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> you ſhould have receiv'd 'em already; but I am afraid there can be no Gratuity proportionable to the Greatneſs of the Cure, and therefore I wou'd not have the Remedy depend upon a Reward; for who knows whether my proffering it, or thy Acceptance of it, might not hinder the Effect of the Penance? However, ſince we've gone ſo far, we'll put it to a Tryal; come <hi>Sancho,</hi> name your Price, and down with your Breeches. Firſt pay your Hide, then pay your ſelf out of the Money of mine that you have in your Cuſtody. <hi>Sancho,</hi> opening his Eyes and Ears a Foot wide at this fair Offer, leap'd preſently at the Propoſal. Ay, ay, Sir, now you ſay ſomething, quoth he, I'll do't with a Jirk now, ſince you ſpeak ſo feelingly: I have a Wife and Children to maintain, Sir, and I muſt mind the main Chance. Come then, how much will you give me by the Laſh? Were your Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> to be anſwerable to the Greatneſs and Merits of the Cure, not all the Wealth of <hi>Venice,</hi> nor the <hi>Indian</hi> Mines were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to reward thee. But ſee what Caſh you have of mine in your Hands, and ſet what Price you will on every Stripe. The Laſhes, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> are in all three thouſand three hundred and odd, of which I have had five; The reſt are
<pb n="1293" facs="tcp:54446:692"/>
to come, let thoſe five go for the odd ones, and let's come to the three thouſand three hundred. At a <hi>Quartillo,</hi> or three half Pence a Piece (and I wou'd not bate a Farthing, if 'twere to my Brother) they will make three thouſand three hundred three Half-pences. Three thouſand three Half-pences make fifteen hundred three Pences, which amounts to ſeven hundred and fifty Reals or Six-pences. Now the three hundred remaining three Half-pences make an hundred and fifty three Pences, and threeſcore and fifteen Six-pences; put that together, and it comes juſt to eight hundred and twenty five Reals or Six-pences to a Farthing. This Money, Sir, if you pleaſe, I'll de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct from yours that I have in my Hands, and then I'll reckon my ſelf well paid for my jirking, and go home well pleas'd, though well whipp'd; but that's nothing, Something has ſome Savour; he muſt not think to catch Fiſh, who is afraid to wet his Feet. I need ſay no more. Now Bleſſings on thy Heart, my deareſt <hi>Sancho,</hi> cry'd Don <hi>Quixote.</hi> Oh my Friend, how ſhall <hi>Dulcinea</hi> and I be bound to pray for thee, and ſerve thee while it ſhall pleaſe Heaven to continue us on Earth! If ſhe recover her former Shape and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as now ſhe infallibly muſt, her Misfortune will turn to her Felicity, and I ſhall triumph in my Defeat. Speak, dear <hi>Sancho,</hi> when wilt thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon thy Task, and a hundred Reals more ſhall be at thy Service, as a Gratuity for thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expeditious. I'll begin this very Night, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> do you but order it ſo that we may lye in the Fields, and you ſhall ſee how I'll lay about me, I ſhan't be ſparing of my Fleſh, I'll aſſure you.</p>
                        <p>Don <hi>Quixote</hi> long'd for Night ſo impatiently, that like all eager expecting Lovers, he fancy'd
<pb n="1294" facs="tcp:54446:693"/>
                           <hi>Phoebus</hi> had broke his Chariot-wheels, which made the Day of ſo unuſual a Length; but at laſt it grew dark, and they went out of the Road into a ſhady Wood, where they both alighted, and being ſat down upon the Graſs, they went to Supper upon ſuch Proviſion as <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Wallet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded.</p>
                        <p>And now having ſatisfy'd himſelf, he thought it Time to ſatisfy his Maſter, and earn his Money. To which Purpoſe, he made himſelf a Whip of <hi>Dapple</hi>'s Halter, and having ſtripp'd himſelf to the Waſte, retir'd farther up into the Wood at a ſmall Diſtance from his Maſter. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> obſerving his Readineſs and Reſolution, could not forbear calling after him; Dear <hi>Sancho,</hi> cry'd he, be not too cruel to thy felf neither, have a Care, do not hack thy ſelf to Pieces. Make not more Haſte than good Speed; go more gently to Work, ſoft and fair goes fartheſt; I mean, I would not have thee kill thy ſelf before thou getteſt to the End of the Tally; and that the Reckoning may be fair on both Sides, I will ſtand at a Diſtance, and keep an Account of the Strokes by the Help of my Beads: And ſo Heaven proſper thy pious Undertaking. He's an honeſt Man, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> who pays to a Farthing. I only mean to give my ſelf a handſome Whipping, for I don't think I need kill my ſelf to work Miracles. With that he began to exerciſe the Inſtrument of Penance, and Don <hi>Quixote</hi> to tell the Stroaks. But by that Time, that <hi>Sancho</hi> had apply'd ſeven or eight Laſhes on his own Back, he felt the Jeſt bite him ſo ſmartly, that he began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent him of his Bargain: Whereupon, after a ſhort Pauſe, he call'd to his Maſter, and told him that he would be off with him, for ſuch Laſhes as theſe, laid on with ſuch a confounded
<pb n="1295" facs="tcp:54446:693"/>
Lick-back, were modeſtly worth three Pence a-piece of any Man's Money; and truly he could not afford to go on at three Half-pence a Laſh. Go on, Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> anſwer'd Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote,</hi> take Courage and proceed, I'll double thy Pay; if that be all. Say you ſo, quoth <hi>Sancho?</hi> then have at all; I'll lay it on thick and three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. Do but liſten—With that, <hi>Slap</hi> went the Scurage; but the cunning Knave left Preſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his own Skin, and fell foul o' the Trees, fetching ſuch diſmal Groans every now and then, that one would have thought he had been giving up the Ghoſt. Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> who was naturally tender-hearted, fearing he might make an End of himſelf before he could finiſh his Penance, and ſo diſappoint the happy Effects of it, Hold, cry'd he, hold my Friend, as thou loveſt thy Life, hold I conjure thee, no more at this Time. This ſeems to me a very ſharp Sort of Phyſick. Therefore pray don't take it all at once, make two Doſes of it. Come, come, all in good Time, <hi>Rome</hi> was not built in a Day. If I have told right, thou haſt given thy ſelf above a thouſand Stripes; that's enough for one Heating; for, to uſe a homely Phraſe, The Aſs will carry his Load, but not a double Load; Ride not a free Horſe to Death. No, no, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> it ſhall ne'er be ſaid of me, the eaten Bread is forgotten, or that I thought it working for a dead Horſe, becauſe I am paid before-hand. Therefore ſtand off I beſeech ye; get out of the Reach of my Whip, and let me lay on t'other Thouſand, and then the Heart of the Work will be broke. Such another flogging Bout, and the Jobb will be over. Since thou art in the Humour, reply'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> I will withdraw, and Heaven ſtrengthen and reward thee! With that, <hi>Sancho</hi> fell to work afreſh, and
<pb n="1296" facs="tcp:54446:694"/>
beginning upon a new Score, laſh'd the Trees at ſo unconſcionable a Rate, that he fetch'd off their Skins moſt unmercifully. At length, raiſing his Voice, ſeemingly reſolv'd to give himſelf a ſparring Blow, he lets drive at a Beech-Tree with might and main. There, cry'd he! down with thee, <hi>Sampſon,</hi> and all that are about thee! This diſmal Cry, with the Sound of the dreadful Stroke that attended it, made Don <hi>Quixote</hi> run preſently to his Squire, and laying faſt hold on the Halter, which <hi>Sancho</hi> had twiſted about and manag'd like a Bull's Pizzle, Hold cry'd he, Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſtay the Fury of thy Arm: Do'ſt thou think I will have thy Death and the Ruin of thy Wife and Children to be laid at my Door? Forbid it Fate! Let <hi>Dulcinea</hi> ſtay a While, till a better Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty offers it ſelf. I my ſelf will be contented to live in Hopes, that when thou haſt recover'd new Strength, the Buſineſs may be accompliſh'd to every Body's Satisfaction. Well, Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> if it be your Worſhip's Will and Pleaſure it ſhould be ſo, ſo let it be, quo I. But, for Goodneſs-ſake, do ſo much as throw your Clo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

With that, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> took off his Cloak from his own Shoulders, and putting it over thoſe of <hi>Sancho,</hi> choſe to remain in Cuerpo, and the crafty Squire being lapp'd up warm, fell faſt aſleep, and never ſtirr'd till the Sun wak'd him.</p>
                        <p>In the Morning they went on their Journey, and after three Hours riding, alighted at an Inn, for it was allow'd by Don <hi>Quixote</hi> himſelf to be an Inn, and not a Caſtle with Moats, Towers, Portcullices and Draw-Bridges, as he commonly
<pb n="1297" facs="tcp:54446:694"/>
fancy'd; for now the Knight was mightily off the romantick Pin, to what he us'd to be, as ſhall be ſhew'd preſently more at large. He was lodg'd in a ground Room, which inſtead of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtry was hung with a courſe painted Stuff, ſuch as is often ſeen in Villages. One of the Pieces had the Story of <hi>Helen</hi> of <hi>Troy,</hi> when <hi>Paris</hi> ſtole her away from her Husband <hi>Menelaus,</hi> but ſcrawl'd out after a bungling Rate by ſome wretched Dawber or other. Another had the Story of <hi>Dido</hi> and <hi>Aeneas,</hi> the Lady on the Top of a Turret, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Sheet to her fugitive Gueſt, who was in a Ship at Sea, crouding all the Sails he could to get from her. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> made this Obſervation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the two Stories, that <hi>Helen</hi> was not at all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd at the Force put upon her but rather leer'd and ſmil'd upon her Lover: Whereas on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Side, the fair <hi>Dido</hi> ſhew'd her Grief by her Tears, which, becauſe they ſhould be ſeen, the Painter had made as big as Walnuts. How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> were theſe two Ladies, that they liv'd not in this Age, or rather how much more unhappy am I, for not having liv'd in theirs! I would have met and ſtopp'd thoſe Gentlemen, and ſav'd both <hi>Troy</hi> and <hi>Carthage</hi> from Deſtruction; nay, by the Death of <hi>Paris</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone all theſe Miſeries had been prevented. I'll lay you a Wager, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that before we be much older, there will not be an Inn, a hedge-Tavern, a blind Victualling-houſe, nor a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber's Shop in the Country, but what will have the Story of our Lives and Deeds paſted and painted along the Walls. But I could wiſh with all my Heart though, that they may be done by a better Hand than the bungling Son of a Whore that drew theſe. Thou art in the Right, <hi>Sancho;</hi> for the Fellow that did theſe, puts me in
<pb n="1298" facs="tcp:54446:695"/>
Mind of <hi>Orbaneja</hi> the Painter of <hi>Uveda,</hi> who as he ſat at Work, being ask'd what he was about, made Anſwer, any Thing that comes uppermoſt; and if he chanc'd to draw a Cock, he underwrit, <hi>This is a Cock,</hi> leſt People ſhould take it for a Fox. Juſt ſuch a one was he that painted, or that wrote, (for they are much the ſame) the Hiſtory, of this new Don <hi>Quixote</hi> that has late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly peep'd out, and ventur'd to go a ſtrolling; for his Painting or Writing is all at Random, and any Thing that comes uppermoſt. I fancy he's al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo not much unlike one <hi>Mauleon,</hi> a certain Poet, who was at Court ſome Years ago, and pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give Anſwer <hi>ex tempore</hi> to any manner of Queſtions; ſome Body ask'd him what was the Meaning of <hi>Deum de Deo,</hi> whereupon my Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man anſwer'd very pertly in <hi>Spaniſh, De donde diere,</hi> that is, <hi>hab nab at a venture.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But to come to our own Affairs. Haſt thou an Inclination to have t'other Bruſh to Night? What think you of a warm Houſe? would it not do better for that Service than the open Air? Why, truly quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> a Whipping is but a Whipping either abroad or within Doors, and I could like a cloſe Room well enough, ſo it were among Trees, for I love Trees hugely, d'ye ſee, methinks they bear me Company, and have a Sort of fellow-feeling of my Sufferings. Now I think on't, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> it ſhall not be to Night, honeſt <hi>Sancho,</hi> you ſhall have more Time to recover, and we'll let the Reſt alone till we get home, 'twill not be above two Days at moſt. E'en as your Worſhip pleaſes, anſwer'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> but if I might have my Will, it were beſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an End of the Jobb now my Hand's in, and my Blood up. There's nothing like ſtriking while the Iron is hot, for Delay breeds Danger,
<pb n="1299" facs="tcp:54446:695"/>
'tis beſt grinding at the Mill before the Water's paſt; ever take while you may have it; a Bird in Hand is worth two in the Buſh. For Heaven's ſake, good <hi>Sancho,</hi> cry'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> let alone thy Proverbs; if once thou go'ſt back to <hi>Sicut erat,</hi> or as it was in the Beginning, I muſt give thee over. Can'ſt thou not ſpeak as other Folks do, and not after ſuch a tedious and intricate manner. How often have I told thee of this? Mind what I tell you, I'm ſure you'll be the better for't. 'Tis an unlucky Trick I've got, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> I can't bring you in three Words to the Purpoſe without a Proverb, nor bring you in any Proverb but what I think to the Purpoſe; but I'll mend if I can. And ſo for this time their Converſation broke off.</p>

                        <p>In the mean Time, a Gentleman with three or four Servants, came riding up to the Inn, and one of 'em calling him that appear'd to be the Maſter, by the Name of Don <hi>Alvaro Tarfe,</hi> your Worſhip, ſaid he, had as good ſtop here till the

                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>urning to his Squire, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid he, I am much miſtaken if I had not a Glimpſe of this very Name of Don <hi>Alvaro Tarfe,</hi> in turning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that pretended ſecond Part of my Hiſtory. As likely as not, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but firſt let him alight, and then we'll queſtion him about the Matter.</p>
                        <p>The Gentleman alighted, and was ſhew'd by the Land-lady into a Ground-Room that fac'd Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Apartment, and was hung with the ſame Sort of courſe painted Stuff. A While af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Stranger had undreſs'd for Coolneſs, he came out to take a Turn; and walked into the Porch of the Houſe, that was large and airy. There he found Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> to whom addreſſing himſelf, Pray, Sir, ſaid he, which Way do you travel? To a Country-Town not far off, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> the Place of my Nativity. And pray, Sir, which Way are you bound? To <hi>Granada,</hi> Sir, ſaid the Knight, the Country where I was born. And a fine Country it is, reply'd Don <hi>Quixote.</hi> But pray, Sir, may I beg the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to know your Name, for the Information I am perſwaded will be of more Conſequence to my Afairs than I can well tell you. They call me Don <hi>Alvaro Tarfe,</hi> anſwer'd the Gentleman. Then without Diſpute, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> you are the ſame Don <hi>Alvaro Tarfe,</hi> whoſe Name fills a Place in the ſecond Part of Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha</hi>'s Hiſtory, that was lately publiſh'd by a New Author? The very Man, anſwer'd the Knight; and that very Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> who is the principal Subject of that Book, was my intimate Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. I am the Perſon that intic'd him from his
<pb n="1301" facs="tcp:54446:696"/>
Habitation, ſo far at leaſt, that he had never ſeen the Tournament at <hi>Saragoſa,</hi> had it not been through my Perſwaſions, and in my Company; and indeed, as it happen'd, I prov'd the beſt Friend he had, and did him a ſingular Piece of Service; for had I not ſtood by him, his intoler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Impudence bad brought him to ſome ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Puniſhment. But pray, Sir, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> be pleas'd to tell me one Thing; Am I any thing like that Don <hi>Quixote</hi> of yours? The fartheſt from it in the World, Sir, reply'd the other. And had he, ſaid our Knight, one <hi>Sancho Pança</hi> for his Squire? Yes, ſaid Don <hi>Alvaro,</hi> but I was the moſt deceiv'd in him that could be; for by common Report that ſame Squire was a comical, witty Fellow, but I found him a very great Blockhead. I thought no leſs, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> for every Man's Noſe won't make a Shoeing-Horn; and that <hi>Sancho</hi> you talk of muſt be ſome paltry Raggamuffin, ſome guttling Mumper, or Pilfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Crack-Rope, I warrant him. For 'tis I that am the true <hi>Sancho Pança;</hi> 'tis I that am the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-conceited Squire, that have always a Tinker's Budget full of Wit and Waggery, that will make Gravity grin in ſpight of its Teeth. If you won't believe me, do but try me; keep me Company but for a Twelve-Month, or ſo, you'll find what a Shower of Jokes, and notable Things drop from me every Foot. Adad! I ſet every Body a Laughing, many times, and yet I wiſh I may be hang'd if I deſign'd it in the leaſt. And then for the true Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> here you have him before you: The Stanch, the Famous, the Valiant, the Wiſe, the Loving Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> the Righter of Wrongs, the Puniſher of Wickedenſs, the Father to the Fatherleſs, the Bully-rock of Widows, the Murderer of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
<pb n="1302" facs="tcp:54446:697"/>
and Maidens, he whoſe only Dear and Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heart is the peerleſs <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo;</hi> here he is, and here am I his Squire. All other Don <hi>Quixote's,</hi> and all <hi>Sancho Pança's</hi> beſides us two, are but Shams, and Tales of a Tub. Now by the Sword of St. <hi>Jago,</hi> honeſt Friend, ſaid Don <hi>Alvaro,</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve as much; for the little thou haſt utter'd now, has more of Humour, than all I ever heard come from the other. The Blockhead ſeem'd to carry all his Brains in his Guts, there's nothing a Jeſt with him but filling his Belly, and the Rogue's too heavy to be diverting. For my Part, I believe the Inchanters that perſecute the good Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> have ſent the bad one to perſecute me too. I can't tell what to make of this Matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for though I can take my Oath I left one Don <hi>Quixote</hi> under the Surgeon's Hands at the Nuncio's Houſe in <hi>Toledo,</hi> yet here ſtarts up another Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> quite different from mine. For my Part, ſaid our Knight, I dare not avow my ſelf the good, but I may venture to ſay, I am not the bad one; and as a Proof of it, Sir, be aſſur'd, that in the whole Courſe of my Life, I never ſaw the City of <hi>Saragoſa;</hi> and ſo far from it, that hearing this Uſurper of my Name had appear'd there at the Tournament, I declin'd coming near it, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to convince the World that he was an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor. I directed my Courſe to <hi>Barcelona,</hi> the Seat of Urbanity, the Sanctuary of Strangers, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge of the Diſtreſs'd, the Mother of Men of Valour, the Redreſſer of the Injur'd, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence of true Friendiſhp, and the firſt City of the World for Beauty and Situation. And though ſome Accidents that befell me there, are ſo far from being grateful to my Thoughts, that they are a ſenſible Mortification to me, yet in my Reflections of having ſeen that City, I
<pb n="1303" facs="tcp:54446:697"/>
find Pleaſure enough to alleviate my Misfortune. In ſhort, Don <hi>Alvaro,</hi> I am that Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> whom Fame has celebrated, and not the pitiful Wretch who has uſurp'd my Name, and would arrogate to himſelf the Honour of my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. Sir, you are a Gentleman, and I hope will not deny me the Favour to depoſe before the Magiſtrate of this Place, that you never ſaw me in all your Life 'till this Day, and that I am not the Don <hi>Quixote</hi> mention'd in this ſecond Part, nor was this <hi>Sancho Pança</hi> my Squire, the Perſon you knew formerly. With all my Heart, ſaid Don <hi>Alvaro,</hi> though I muſt own my ſelf not a little confounded to find at the ſame Time two Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s and two <hi>Sancho Pança's</hi> as different in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour as they are alike in Appellation; for my Part, I don't know what to think on't, and I'm ſometimes apt to fancy my Senſes have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd upon. Ay, ay, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> there has been foul Play to be ſure. The ſame Trick that ſerv'd to bewitch my Lady <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo,</hi> has been play'd you, and if three Thouſand and odd Laſhes laid on by me on the hind Part of my Belly, wou'd diſ-inchant your Worſhip as well as her, they ſhou'd be at your Service with all my Heart, and what's more, they ſhould not coſt you a Farthing. I don't underſtand what you mean by thoſe Laſhes, ſaid Don <hi>Alvaro.</hi> Thereby hangs a Tale, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but that's too long at a Minute's Warning; if it be our Luck to be Fellow-Travellers, you may chance to hear more of the Matter.</p>
                        <p>Dinner-time being come, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> and Don <hi>Alvaro</hi> din'd together; and the Mayor or Bailiff of the Town happening to come into the Inn with a Publick Notary, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> deſir'd him to take the Depoſition which Don <hi>Alvaro Tarfe</hi> was
<pb n="1304" facs="tcp:54446:698"/>
ready to give, where he certify'd, and declar'd, That the ſaid Deponent had not any Knowledge of the Don <hi>Quixote</hi> there preſent, and that the ſaid Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was not the ſame Perſon that he this Deponent had ſeen mention'd in a certain printed Hiſtory, intitul'd, or call'd the ſecond Part of Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> written by <hi>Abellaneda;</hi> a Native of <hi>Tordeſillas.</hi> In ſhort, the Magiſtrate drew up and engroſs'd the Affidavit in due Form, and the Teſtimonial wanted nothing to make it anſwer all the Intentions of Don <hi>Quixote</hi> and <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> who were as much pleas'd as if it had been a Matter of the laſt Conſequence, and that their Words and Behaviour had not been enough to make the Diſtinction apparent between the two Don <hi>Quixote's</hi> and the two <hi>Sancho's.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Compliments and Offers of Service that paſs'd after that between Don <hi>Alvaro</hi> and Don <hi>Quixote</hi> were many, and our Knight of <hi>La Mancha</hi> behav'd himſelf in that with ſo much Diſcretion, that Don <hi>Alvaro</hi> was convinc'd he was miſtaken; for he thought there was ſome Inchantment in the Caſe, ſince he had thus met with two Knights and two Squires of the ſame Names and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, and yet ſo very different.</p>
                        <p>They ſet out towards the Evening, and about half a League from the Town the Road part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into two, one Way led to Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, and the other was that which Don <hi>Alvaro</hi> was to take. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> in that little Time let him underſtand the Misfortune of his Defeat, with <hi>Dulcinea</hi>'s Inchantment, and the Remedy preſcrib'd by <hi>Merlin;</hi> all which was new Matter of Wonder to Don <hi>Alvaro,</hi> who having embrac'd Don <hi>Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho,</hi> left them in their Way, and he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his own.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="1305" facs="tcp:54446:698"/>Don <hi>Quixote</hi> paſs'd that Night among the Trees, to give <hi>Sancho</hi> a fair Occaſion to make an End of his Diſcipline, when the cunning Knave put it in Practice, juſt after the ſame Manner as the Night before. The Bark of the Trees pay'd for all, and <hi>Sancho</hi> took ſuch Care of his Back, that a Fly might have reſted there without any Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance.</p>
                        <p>All the While his abus'd Maſter was very punctual in telling the Stroaks, and reckon'd that with thoſe of the foregoing Night, they amounted juſt to the Sum of Three Thouſand and twenty nine. The Riſing Sun, that ſeem'd to have made more than ordinary Haſte to view this Humane Sacrifice, gave 'em Light however to continue their Journey; and as they went on, they diſcanted at large upon Don <hi>Alvaro</hi>'s Miſtake, and their own Prudence in relation to the Certificate before the Magiſtrate, in ſo full and authentick a Form.</p>
                        <p>Their Travels all that Day, and the enſuing Night, had no Occurrence worth mentioning, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating that <hi>Sancho</hi> that Night put the laſt hand to his Whipping-work, to the inexpreſſible Joy of Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> who waited for the Day with as great Impatience, in hopes he might light on his Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi> in her diſinchanted State; and all the Way he went, he made up to every Woman he ſpy'd, to ſee whether ſhe were <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo</hi> or not; for he ſo firmly rely'd on <hi>Merlin</hi>'s Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, that he did not doubt of the Performance.</p>
                        <p>He was altogether taken up with theſe Hopes and Fancies, when they got to the Top of a Hill, that gave 'em a Proſpect of their Village. <hi>Sancho</hi> had no ſooner bleſs'd his Eyes with the Sight, but down he fell on his Knees, and O my long, long
<pb n="1306" facs="tcp:54446:699"/>
wiſh'd for Home, cry'd he, open thy Eyes and here behold thy Child <hi>Sancho Pança</hi> come back to thee again, if not very full of Money, yet ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry full of Whipping: Open thy Arms, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thy Son Don <hi>Quixote</hi> too, who, tho' he got the worſt on't with another, he ne'ertheleſs got the better of himſelf, and that's the beſt Kind of Victory one can wiſh for; I have his own Word for it. However, tho' I have been ſwingingly flogg'd, yet I han't loſt all by the Bargain, for I have whipp'd ſome Money into my Pocket. Forbear thy Impertinence, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and let us now in a decent Manner make our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try into the Place of our Nativity, where we will give a Looſe to our Imaginations, and lay down the Plan that ought to be follow'd in our intended Paſtoral Life. With theſe Words they came down the Hill, and went directly to their Village.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. LXXIII.</hi> Of the ominous Accidents that croſs'd Don <hi>Quixote</hi> as he enter'd his Village, with other Tranſactions that illuſtrate and adorn this memorable Hiſtory.</head>
                        <p>WHEN they were entring into the Village, as <hi>Cid Hamet</hi> relates, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> obſerv'd two little Boys conteſting together in an adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Field; and ſays one to the other, Never fret thy Ghizzard about it, for thou ſhalt never ſee
<pb n="1307" facs="tcp:54446:699"/>
her while thou haſt Breath in thy Body. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> over-hearing this, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſaid he, did you mind the Boy's Words, <hi>Thou ſhalt never ſee her while thou haſt Breath in thy Body.</hi> Well, anſwer'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> and what's the great Buſineſs though the Boy did ſay ſo? How, reply'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> do'ſt thou not perceive, that applying the Words to my Affairs, they plainly imply that I ſhall never ſee my <hi>Dulcinea. Sancho</hi> was about to anſwer again, when a full Cry of Hounds and Huntſmen put up a Hare, which they cours'd ſo hard to her Shifts, that ſhe came and ſquatted down for Shelter juſt between <hi>Dapple</hi>'s Feet. Immediately <hi>Sancho</hi> laid Hold of her without Difficulty, and preſented her to Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> but he, with a dejected Look, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing the Preſent, cry'd out aloud, <hi>Malum ſignum, Malum ſignum, An ill Omen.</hi> A Hare runs away, Hounds and Courſers purſue her, and <hi>Dulcinea</hi> is not ſtarted. You are a ſtrange Man, quoth <hi>Sancho.</hi> Can't we ſuppoſe now, that poor Puſs here is <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinea,</hi> the Gray-hounds that follow'd her are theſe Dogs the Inchanters, that made her a Country-Puſs. She ſcours away, I catch her by the Scut, and give her ſafe and ſound into your Worſhip's Hands; and pray make much of her now you have her; for my Part, I can't for the Blood of me ſee any Harm nor any ill Luck in this Matter.</p>
                        <p>By this Time the two Boys that had fallen out came up to ſee the Hare; and <hi>Sancho</hi> having ask'd the Cauſe of their Quarrel, he was anſwer'd by the Boy that ſpoke the ominous Words, that he had ſnatch'd from his Play-fellow a little Cage full of Crickets, which he would not let him have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Upon that <hi>Sancho</hi> put his Hand in his Pocket, and gave the Boy a Three-penny Piece for his Cage, and giving it to Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> There, Sir, quoth he, here are all the Signs of ill Luck come
<pb n="1308" facs="tcp:54446:700"/>
to nothing. You have 'em in your own Hands, and though I am but a Dunder-head, I dare ſwear theſe Things are no more to us than the Rain that fell at <hi>Chriſtmaſs.</hi> I am much miſtaken if I ha'n't heard the Parſon of our Pariſh adviſe all ſober Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks againſt heeding theſe Whim-whams; and I have heard you your ſelf, my dear Maſter, ſay, that any Chriſtian that troubl'd his Head with theſe Fortune-telling Follies, was neither better nor worſe than a Numskull: So let us e'en leave Things as we found 'em, and get home as faſt as we can.</p>
                        <p>By this Time the Sports-men were come up, and demanding their Game, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> deliver'd them their Hare. They paſs'd on, and juſt at their coming into the Town, they perceiv'd the Curate and the Batchelor <hi>Carraſco</hi> at their Devotions in a ſmall Field adjoyning. But we muſt obſerve by the Way, that <hi>Sancho Pança,</hi> to cover his Maſter's Armour, had by Way of a Sumpter-Cloth, laid over <hi>Dapple</hi>'s Back the Buckram-Frock figur'd with Blazes of Fire, which he wore at the Duke's the Night that <hi>Altiſidora</hi> roſe from the Dead, and he had no leſs judiciouſly clapp'd the Mitre on the Head of the Aſs; which made ſo odd and whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical a Figure, that it might be ſaid, never four-footed Aſs was ſo bedizen'd before. The Curate and the Batchelor preſently knowing their old Friends, ran to meet 'em with open Arms; and while Don <hi>Quixote</hi> alighted and return'd their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, the Boys, who are ever ſo quick-ſighted that nothing can 'ſcape their Eyes, preſently ſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mitred Aſs, came running and flocking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 'em; Oh Law! cry'd they to one another, look a' there Boys! Here's Gaffer <hi>Sancho Pança</hi>'s Aſs as fine as a Lady! and Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Beaſt as lean as the new Moon. With that they ran hoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="1309" facs="tcp:54446:700"/>
and hallowing about 'em thro' the Town, while the two Adventurers, attended by the Curate and the Batchelor, mov'd towards Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Houſe, where they were receiv'd at the Door by his old Houſe-keeper and his Niece, that had already had Notice of their Arrival. The News having alſo reach'd <hi>Tereſa Pança, Sancho</hi>'s Wife, ſhe came run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning half naked, with her Hair about her Ears, to ſee him; Hand in Hand all the Way with her Daughter <hi>Sanchica,</hi> who hardly wanted to be lugg'd along. But when ſhe found that her Husband look'd a little ſhort of the State of a Governour, Mercy o' me, quoth ſhe, what's the Meaning of this, Husband! You look as tho' you had come all the Way on Foot, nay, and tir'd off your Legs too! Why, you come liker a Shark than like a Governour. Mum, <hi>Tereſa,</hi> quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> 'tis not all Gold that gliſters, and every Man was not born with a ſilver Spoon in his Mouth. Firſt let's go home, and then I'll tell thee Wonders. I've ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Care of the main Chance. Money I have, old Girl, and I came honeſtly by it, without wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Body. Haſt got Money, old Boy, nay then 'tis well enough, no Matter which Way, let it come by Hook or by Crook, 'tis but what your Betters have done afore you. At the ſame Time <hi>Sanchica</hi> hugging her Father, ask'd him what he had brought her home, for ſhe had gap'd for him as the Flowers do for the Dew in <hi>May.</hi> Thus <hi>Sancho</hi> leading <hi>Dapple</hi> by the Halter on one Side, his Wife taking him under the Arm on the other, and his Daughter faſtning upon the Waſte-band of his Breeches, away they went together to his Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, leaving Don <hi>Quixote</hi> at his own Houſe, under the Care of his Niece and Houſe-keeper, with the Curate and Batchelor to keep him Company.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="1310" facs="tcp:54446:701"/>That very Moment Don <hi>Quixote</hi> took the two laſt aſide, and without mincing the Matter, gave 'em a ſhort Account of his Defeat, and the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation he lay under of being confin'd to his Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage for a Year, which, like a true Knight-Errant, he had reſolv'd punctually to obſerve: He added, that he intended to paſs that Interval of Time in the innocent Functions of a Paſtoral Life, and therefore he would immediately commence Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, and entertain his amorous Paſſion ſolitarily in Fields and Woods; and begg'd, if Buſineſs of greater Importance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were not an Obſtruction, that they wou'd both pleaſe to be his Companions, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring them he would furniſh them with ſuch a Number of Sheep, as might entitle them to ſuch a Profeſſion. He alſo told 'em, that he had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in a Manner fitted them for the Undertaking, for he had provided them all with Names the moſt paſtoral in the World. The Curate being deſirous to know the Names, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> told him he wou'd himſelf be call'd the Shepherd <hi>Quixot is,</hi> that the Batchelor ſhou'd be call'd the Shepherd <hi>Carraſcon,</hi> the Curate Paſtor <hi>Curiambro,</hi> and <hi>Sancho Pança, Panſino</hi> the Shepherd.</p>
                        <p>They were ſtruck with Amazement at this new Strain of Folly; but conſidering this might be a Means of keeping him at home, and hoping at the ſame Time, that within the Year he might be cur'd of his mad Knight-Errantry, they allow'd of his Paſtoral Folly, and with great Applauſe to his Project, freely offer'd their Company in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. We ſhall live the moſt pleaſant Life imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, ſaid <hi>Sampſon Carraſco;</hi> for, as every Body knows, I am a moſt celebrated Poet, and I'll write Paſtorals in abundance. Sometimes too I may raiſe my Strain, as Occaſion offers, to divert us as we range the Groves and Plains. But one Thing,
<pb n="1311" facs="tcp:54446:701"/>
Gentlemen, we muſt not forget, 'tis abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that each of us chooſe a Name for the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſs to be celebrated in his Lays, nor muſt we forget the Ceremony us'd by the amorous Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, of writing, carving, notching, or engrav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on every Tree the Names of Shepherdeſſes, tho' the Bark be ever ſo hard. You are very much in the Right, reply'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> tho' for my Part, I need not be at the Trouble of deviſing a Name for an imaginary Shepherdeſs, being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy captivated by the peerleſs <hi>Dulcinea del Toboſo,</hi> the Nymph of theſe Streams, the Ornament of theſe Meads, the Primroſe of Beauty, the Cream of Gracefulneſs, and in ſhort, the Subject that can merit all the Praiſes that hyperbolical Eloquence can beſtow. We grant all this, ſaid the Curate, but we who can't pretend to ſuch Perfections, muſt make it our Buſineſs to find out ſome Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſes of a lower Form, that will be good-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd, and meet a Man Half-way upon Occaſion. We ſhall find enough, I'll warrant you, reply'd <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſco:</hi> 'Tis but giving them Names out of ſome Book or other, if we can find no other; there are <hi>Phillis, Amarillis, Diana, Florinda, Galatea, Beliſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> and a thouſand more, are to be diſpos'd of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly in the open Market; and when we have purchas'd 'em, they are our own. Beſides, if my Miſtreſs (my Shepherdeſs I ſhould have ſaid) be call'd <hi>Ann,</hi> I will name her in my Verſes <hi>Anarda;</hi> if <hi>Frances,</hi> I'll call her <hi>Francenia;</hi> and if <hi>Lucy</hi> be her Name, then <hi>Lucinda</hi> ſhall be my Shepherdeſs, and ſo forth; and if <hi>Sancho Pança</hi> makes one of our Fraternity, he may celebrate his Wife <hi>Tereſa</hi> by the Name of <hi>Tereſaina.</hi> Don <hi>Quixote</hi> could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear ſmiling at the Turn given to that Name. The Curate again applauded his laudable Reſolution, and repeated his Offer of bearing him Company
<pb n="1312" facs="tcp:54446:702"/>
all the Time that his other Employment wou'd allow him; and then they took their Leaves, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him all the good Advice that they thought conducing to his Health and Welfare</p>
                        <p>No ſooner were the Curate and Batchelor gone, but the old Houſe-Maid and Niece, who, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Cuſtom, had been liſtening to all their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, came both upon Don <hi>Quixote:</hi> Bleſs me, Uncle, cry'd the Niece, what's here to do! What new Maggot's got into your Head? When we thought you were come to ſtay at home, and live like a ſober honeſt Gentleman in your own Houſe, are you hearkning after new Inventions, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a Wooll-gathering after Sheep, forſooth! By my truly, Sir, you're ſomewhat of the lateſt: The Corn is too old to make Oaten Pipes of. Lord, Sir, quoth the Houſe-keeper, how will your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip be able to endure the Summer's Sun, and the Winter's Froſt in the open Fields? And then the Howling of the Wolves, Heaven bleſs us! pray, good Sir, don't think on't: 'Tis a Buſineſs fit for no Body but thoſe that are bred and born to it, and as ſtrong as Horſes. Let the Worſt come to the Worſt, better be a Knight-Errant ſtill, than a Keeper of Sheep. Troth, Maſter, take my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; I am neither drunk nor mad, but freſh and faſting from every Thing but Sin, and I have fifty Years over my Head, be rul'd by me: Stay at nome, look after your Concerns, go often to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, do Good to the Poor, and if ought goes ill with you, let it lie at my Door. Good Girls, ſaid Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> hold your Prating. I know beſt what I have to do: Only help to get me to Bed, for I find my ſelf ſomewhat out of Order. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, don't trouble your Heads; whether I be a Knight-Errant, or an Errant-Shepherd, you ſhall always find that I will provide for you. The Niece
<pb n="1313" facs="tcp:54446:702"/>
and Maid, who without Doubt were good-natur'd Creatures, undreſs'd him, put him to Bed, brought him ſomething to eat, and tended him with all i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable Care.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. LXXIV.</hi> How Don <hi>Quixote</hi> fell ſick, made his last Will, and died.</head>
                        <p>AS all humane Things, eſpecially the Lives of Men, are tranſitory, their very Beginnings being but Steps to their Diſſolution; ſo Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote,</hi> who was no way exempted from the common Fate, was ſnatch'd away by Death when he leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected it. Whether his Sickneſs was the Effect of his melancholick Reflections, or pre-ordain'd by the Heavens, I will not determine; but he was ſeiz'd with a violent Feaver, that confin'd him to his Bed ſix Days.</p>
                        <p>All that Time his good Friends, the Curate, Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelor, and Barber came often to ſee him, and his truſty Squire <hi>Sancho Pança</hi> never ſtirr'd from his Bed-ſide.</p>
                        <p>They conjectur'd that his Sickneſs proceeded from the Regret of his Defeat, and his being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed of <hi>Dulcinea</hi>'s Diſ-inchantment, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly they left nothing uneſſay'd to divert him. The Batchelor begg'd him to pluck up a good Heart, and riſe, that they might begin their Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Life, telling him, that he had already writ an Eclogue to that Purpoſe, not inferiour to thoſe of <hi>Sannazaro,</hi> and that he bought with his own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, of a Shepherd of <hi>Quintana,</hi> two tearing Dogs to watch their Flock, the one call'd <hi>Barcino,</hi> and the other <hi>Bueron;</hi> but this had no Effect on Don
<pb n="1314" facs="tcp:54446:703"/>
                           <hi>Quixote,</hi> for he ſtill continu'd dejected. A Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician was ſent for, who, upon feeling his Pulſe, did not very well like it; and therefore deſir'd him of all Things to provide for his Soul's Health, for that of his Body was in a dangerous Condition. Don <hi>Quixote</hi> heard this with much more Temper than thoſe about him; for his Niece, his Houſe-keeper, and his Squire fell a weeping as bitterly as if he had been laid out already; Don <hi>Quixote</hi> deſir'd them to leave him a little to himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he found himſelf inclinable to Reſt; they re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tir'd, and he had a hearty Sleep of above Six Hours, which the Maid and Niece were afraid would be his laſt.</p>
                        <p>At length he wak'd, and with a loud Voice, Bleſſed be the Almighty, cry'd he, for this great Benefit he has vouchſafed to do me! Infinite are his Mercies; they are greater, and more in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber than the Sins of Men. The Niece harkening very attentively to theſe Words of her Uncle, and finding more Senſe in them than there was in his uſual Talk, at leaſt ſince he had fallen ill; What do you ſay, Sir, ſaid ſhe, has any Thing extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary happen'd? What Mercies are theſe you mention? Mercies, anſwer'd he, that Heaven has this Moment vouchſafed to ſhew me, in ſpite of all my Iniquities. My Judgment is return'd clear and undiſturb'd, and that Cloud of Ignorance is now remov'd, which the continual Reading of thoſe damnable Books of Knight-Errantry had caſt over my Underſtanding. Now I perceive their Nonſenſe and Impertinence, and am only ſorry the Diſcovery happens ſo late, when I want Time to make Amends by thoſe Studies that ſhou'd en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten my Soul, and prepare me for Futurity. I find, Niece, my End approaches; but I wou'd have it ſuch, that tho' my Life has got me the
<pb n="1315" facs="tcp:54446:703"/>
Character of a Mad-man, I may deſerve a better at my Death. Dear Child, continu'd he, ſend for my honeſt Friends, the Curate, the Batchelor <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſco,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Barber, for I intend to make my Confeſſion and my Will. His Niece was ſav'd the Trouble of ſending, for preſently they all three came in; which Don <hi>Quixote</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, My good Friends, ſaid he, I have happy News to tell you; I am no longer Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> but <hi>Alonſo Quixano,</hi> the ſame whom the World for his fair Behaviour has been pleas'd to call <hi>the Good.</hi> I now declare my ſelf an Enemy to <hi>Amadis de Gaul</hi> and his whole Generation; all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Stories of Knight-Errantry, all Romances I deteſt. I have a true Senſe of the Danger of reading them, and of all my paſs'd Follies, and thro' Heaven's Mercy, and my own Experience, I abhor them. His three Friends were not a little ſurprized to hear him talk at this rate, and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſome new Frenzy had poſſeſs'd him. What now, ſaid <hi>Sampſon</hi> to him? What's all this to the Purpoſe, Signior Don <hi>Quixote?</hi> We have juſt had the News that the Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi> is diſ-inchanted, and now we are upon the point of turning Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, to ſing, and live like Princes; you are dwindl'd down to a Hermit.</p>
                        <p>No more of that, I beſeech you, reply'd Don <hi>Quixote;</hi> all the Uſe I ſhall make of theſe Follies at preſent is to heighten my Repentance; and though they have hitherto prov'd prejudicial, yet by the Aſſiſtance of Heaven they may turn to my Advantage at my Death. I find it comes faſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, therefore, pray Gentlemen, let us be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. I want a Prieſt to receive my Confeſſion, and a Scrivener to draw up my Will. There's no trifling at a Time like this; I muſt take Care of
<pb n="1316" facs="tcp:54446:704"/>
my Soul; and therefore pray let the Scrivener be ſent for, while Mr. Curate prepares me by Confeſſion.</p>
                        <p>Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Words put them all into ſuch Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, that they ſtood gazing upon one another; they thought they had Reaſon to doubt of the Return of his Underſtanding, and yet they cou'd not help believing him. They were alſo appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive he was near the Point of Death, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the ſudden Recovery of his Intellects; and he deliver'd himſelf after that with ſo much Senſe, Diſcretion and Piety, and ſhew'd himſelf ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to the Will of Heaven, that they made no Scruple to believe him reſtor'd to his perfect Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at laſt. The Curate thereupon clear'd the Room of all the Company but himſelf and Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> and then confeſs'd him. In the mean time the Batchelor ran for the Scrivener, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently brought him with him; and <hi>Sancha Pança</hi> being inform'd by the Batchelor how ill his Maſter was, and finding his Niece and Houſe-keeper all in Tears, began to make wry Faces, and fall a crying. The Curate having heard the ſick Perſon's Confeſſion, came out, and told them, that the good <hi>Alonſo Quixano</hi> was very near his End, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in his Senſes; and therefore they had beſt go in, that he might make his Will. Theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Tidings open'd the Sluices of the Houſe-keeper's, the Niece's, and the good Squire's ſwol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Eyes, ſo that a whole Inundation of Tears burſt out of thoſe Flood-Gates, and a thouſand Sighs from their Hearts; for indeed, either as <hi>Alonſo Quixano,</hi> or as Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> as it has been obſerv'd, the ſick Gentleman had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſhew'd himſelf ſuch a good-natur'd Man, and of ſo agreeable a Converſation, that he was not only belov'd by his Family, but by every one that knew him.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Item,</hi> I give and bequeath to <hi>Sancha Pança,</hi> whom in my Madneſs I made my Squire, whatever Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney he has, or may have of mine in his Hands; and whereas there are Reckonings and Accounts to be adjuſted between us, for what he has recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and disburs'd; my Will and Pleaſure is, That whatever may remain due to me, which can be but ſmall, be enjoy'd by him as my free Gift, without any Let or Moleſtation, and much Good may it do him. And as, when I was mad, he was, thro' my Means, made Governour of an Iſland, I wou'd now in my right Senſes give him the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of a Kingdom, were it in my Power, in Conſideration of his Integrity and Faithfulneſs. And now, my Friend, ſaid he, turning to <hi>Sancho,</hi> pardon me that I have brought upon thee, as well as my ſelf, the Scandal of Madneſs, by drawing thee into my own Errors, and perſwading thee there have been, and there are ſtill Knights-Errant in the World. Woe is me, my dear Maſter's Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip! cry'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> all in Tears, don't die, this Bout, but e'en take my Counſel, and live on a many Years; 'tis the maddeſt Trick a Man can ever play in his Life, to let his Breath ſneak out of his Body without any more ado, and without ſo much as a Rap o'er the Pate, or a Kick of the Guts; to go out like the Snuff of a Farthing-Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and die meerly of the Mulligrubs, or the Sullens. For Shame, Sir, don't give way to Slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhneſs, but get out of your doleful Dumps, and riſe. Is this a Time to lie honing and groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

a Bed, when we ſhou'd be abroad in the Fields in our Shepherd's Coats, as we had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd? Ten to one but behind ſome Buſh, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome Hedge, we may find the Lady Madam <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> ſtripp'd of her inchanted Rags, and as fine as a Queen. Mayhaps you take it to Heart, that you were unhors'd, and a little Crupper-ſcratch'd t'other Day; but if that be all, lay the Blame upon me, and ſay 'twas my Fault, in not girt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Rozinante</hi> tight enough. You know too, there's nothing more common in your Errantry-Books, than for the Knights to be every Foot juſtl'd out of the Saddle. There's nothing but Ups and Downs in this World, and he that's caſt down to Day, may be cock-a-hoop to Morrow. Even ſo, ſaid <hi>Sampſon,</hi> honeſt <hi>Sancho</hi> has the right Notion of the Matter. Soft and fair, Gentlemen, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd Don <hi>Quixote,</hi> ne'er look for Birds of this Year in the Neſts of the laſt: I was mad, but I am now in my Senſes; I was once Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> but I am once more the good <hi>Alonſo Quixa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> and I hope the Sincerity of my Words, and my Repentance, may reſtore me the ſame Eſteem you have had for me before, and ſo Mr. Scrivener pray go on.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Item,</hi> I conſtitute and appoint <hi>Antonia Quixano,</hi> my Niece here preſent, ſole Heireſs of all my Eſtate, both Real and Perſonal, after all my juſt Debts and Legacies bequeath'd by theſe Preſents, ſhall have been pay'd, ſatisfy'd, and deducted out of the beſt of my Goods and Chattels; and the firſt of that Kind to be diſcharged, ſhall be the Salary due to my Houſe-keeper, together with twenty Ducats over and above her Wages; which ſaid Sum I leave and bequeath her to buy her Mourning.</p>

                           <hi>Item,</hi> I appoint Mr. Curate, and Mr. <hi>Sampſon Carraſco</hi> the Batchelor, here preſent, to be the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors of this my laſt Will and Teſtament.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Item,</hi> It is my Will, that if my Niece <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia Quixano</hi> be inclinable to marry, it be with none but a Perſon, who, upon ſtrict Inquiry, ſhall be found never to have read a Book of Knight-Errantry in his Life; and in caſe it appears, that he has been converſant in ſuch Books, and that ſhe perſiſts in her Reſolution to marry him, ſhe is then to forfeit all Right and Title to my Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, which, in ſuch Caſe, my Executors are hereby impower'd to diſpoſe to pious Uſes, as they ſhall think moſt convenient.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Item,</hi> I entreat the ſaid Executors, that if at any time they happen to meet with the Author of a Book now extant, entitl'd, <hi>The Second Part of the Atchievements of Don</hi> Quixote de la Mancha, they wou'd from me moſt heartily beg his Pardon for my being undeſignedly the Occaſion of his writing ſuch a Parcel of Impertinences as is contain'd in that Book; for it is the greateſt Burden to my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting Soul, that ever I was the Cauſe of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſuch a Thing publick.</p>
                        <p>Having finiſh'd the Will, he fell into a ſwoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fit, and extended his Body to the full Length in the Bed. All the Company were troubl'd and alarm'd, and ran to his Aſſiſtance: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he came to himſelf at laſt; but relaps'd into the like Fits almoſt every Hour, for the Space of three Days that he liv'd after he had made his Will.</p>
                        <p>The whole Family was in Grief and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and yet, after all, the Niece continu'd to eat, the Houſe-keeper drank, and waſh'd down Sorrow; and <hi>Sancho Pança</hi> made much of himſelf:
<pb n="1320" facs="tcp:54446:706"/>

                        <p>At laſt Don <hi>Quixote</hi>'s Dying-Day did come, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had made all thoſe Preparations for Death which good Chriſtians ought to do; and by many freſh and weighty Arguments, ſhew'd his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of Books of Knight-Errantry. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vener, who was by, proteſted he had never read in any Books of that kind of any Knight-Errant who ever dy'd in his Bed ſo quietly, and like a good Chriſtian, as Don <hi>Quixote</hi> did. In ſhort, amidſt the Tears and Lamentations of his Friends, he gave up the Ghoſt, or to ſpeak more plainly, died; which when the Curate perceiv'd, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd the Scrivener or Notary to give him a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate, how <hi>Alonſo Quixano,</hi> commonly call'd <hi>The Good,</hi> and ſometimes known bp the Name of Don <hi>Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> was departed out of this Life into another, and died a natural Death. This, leſt any other Author but <hi>Cid Hamet Benengeli</hi> ſhou'd take Occaſion to raiſe him from the Dead, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to write fabulous Hiſtories of his pretended Adventures.</p>
                        <p>Thus dy'd that ingenious Gentleman Don <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote de la Mancha,</hi> whoſe Native Place <hi>Cid Hamet</hi> has not thought fit directly to mention, that all the Towns and Villages in <hi>La Mancha</hi> ſhould contend for the Honour of giving him Birth; as the Seven Cities of <hi>Greece</hi> did for <hi>Homer.</hi> We ſhall omit <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Lamentations, and thoſe of the Niece and the Houſe-keeper, as alſo ſeveral Epitaphs that were made for his Tomb, and will only give you this, which the Batchelor <hi>Carraſco</hi> caus'd to be put over it.</p>

For me alone was the great <hi>Quixote</hi> born, and I alone for him. Deeds were his Task; and to record 'em, mine: We two, like Tallies for each other ſtruck, are nothing when apart. In vain the ſpurlous Scribe of <hi>Tordeſellas</hi> dar'd with his blunt and bungling Oſtridge-Quill invade the Deeds of my moſt Valorous Knight: The great Attempt derides his feeble Skill, while he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trays a Senſe benumm'd and frozen.</p>
                        <p>And thou, Reader, if ever thou can'ſt find him out in his Obſcurity, I beſeech thee adviſe him likewiſe to let the wearied, mouldring Bones of <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> reſt quiet in the Earth that covers 'em. Let him not expoſe 'em in <hi>Old Caſtile,</hi> againſt the Sanctions of Death, impiouſly raking him out of the Grave where he really lies ſtretch'd out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond a Poſſibility of taking a third Ramble thro' the World. The two Sallies that he has made al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready (which are the Subject of theſe two Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, and have met with ſuch univerſal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe in this and other Kingdoms) are ſufficient to ridicule the pretended Adventures of other Knights-Errant. Thus adviſing him for the beſt, thou ſhalt diſcharge the Duty of a Chriſtian, and do good to him that wiſhes thee Evil. As for me, I muſt eſteem my ſelf happy, and gain my End in rendring thoſe fabulous, Nonſenſical Stories of Knight-Errantry, the Object of the Publick A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. They are already going down, and I do not doubt but they will drop and fall altogether in good Earneſt, never to riſe again. <hi>Adieu.</hi>
